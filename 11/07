Ground-based planet-hunting surveys alongside dedicated\nspace missions (Kepler, CoRoT) are delivering an ever-increasing number of\nexoplanets, now numbering at ~690, with ESA's GAIA mission planned to bring\nthis number into the thousands. The next logical step is the characterisation\nof these worlds: what is their nature? Why are they as they are?

A\nrotor-router network defines a deterministic walk on a digraph G in which a\nparticle walks from a source vertex until it reaches one of several target\nvertices. Motivated by recent results due to Giacaglia et al., we study\nrotor-router networks in which all non-target vertices have the same type. A\nrotor type r is universal if every hitting sequence can be achieved by a\nhomogeneous rotor-router network consisting entirely of rotors of type r. We\ngive a conjecture that completely classifies universal rotor types. Then, this\nproblem is simplified by a theorem we call the Reduction Theorem that allows us\nto consider only two-state rotors. A rotor-router network called the\ncompressor, because it tends to shorten rotor periods, is introduced along with\nan associated algorithm that determines the universality of almost all rotors.\nNew rotor classes, including boppy rotors, balanced rotors, and BURD rotors,\nare defined to study this algorithm rigorously. Using the compressor the\nuniversality of new rotor classes is proved, and empirical computer results are\npresented to support our conclusions. Prior to these results, less than 100 of\nthe roughly 260,000 possible two-state rotor types of length up to 17 were\nknown to be universal, while the compressor algorithm proves the universality\nof all but 272 of these rotor types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2011 23:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}

In the simplest KKLT constructions, stabilization of internal\ndimensions is rather soft: weak scale masses for moduli are generated, and are\nof order m_\\sigma ~ m_{3/2}. As a consequence one obtains a pattern of soft\nsupersymmetry breaking masses found in gravity and/or anomaly mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models. These models may lead to destabilization\nof internal dimensions in the early universe, unless the Hubble constant during\ninflation is very small. Fortunately, strong stabilization of compactified\ndimensions can be achieved by a proper choice of the superpotential (e.g in the\nKL model with a racetrack superpotential). This allows for a solution of the\ncosmological moduli problem and for a successful implementation of inflation in\nsupergravity. We show that strong moduli stabilization leads a very distinct\npattern of soft supersymmetry breaking masses. In general, we find that soft\nscalar masses remain of order the gravitino mass, while gaugino masses nearly\nvanish at the tree level, i.e. they are of order m_{3/2}^2/m_\\sigma.

This settles\nthe question of designing asymptotically optimal spectral algorithms for\nbalanced separator.

For semi-synchronous robots, all patterns formable with memory are\nalso formable without memory, with the single exception of forming a point\n(i.e., the gathering) by two robots. However, the gathering problem for two\nsemi-synchronous robots without memory is trivially solvable when their local\ncoordinate systems are consistent, and the impossibility proof essentially uses\nthe inconsistencies in their coordinate systems. Motivated by this, this paper\ninvestigates the magnitude of consistency between the local coordinate systems\nnecessary and sufficient to solve the gathering problem for two oblivious\nrobots under semi-synchronous and asynchronous models. To discuss the magnitude\nof consistency, we assume that each robot is equipped with an unreliable\ncompass, the bearings of which may deviate from an absolute reference\ndirection, and that the local coordinate system of each robot is determined by\nits compass.

Through the electric\nquadrupolar coupling, strain affects the magnetic environment as seen by the\nnuclear spins. To guide prospective single-QD nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nas well as dynamic nuclear spin polarization experiments, an atomistic insight\nto the strain and quadrupolar field distributions is presented. A number of\nimplications of the structural and compositional profile of the QD have been\nidentified. A high aspect ratio of the QD geometry enhances the quadrupolar\ninteraction. The inclined interfaces introduce biaxiality and the tilting of\nthe major quadrupolar principal axis away from the growth axis; the alloy\nmixing of gallium into the QD enhances both of these features while reducing\nthe quadrupolar energy. Regarding the NMR spectra, both Faraday and Voigt\ngeometries are investigated, unraveling in the first place the extend of\ninhomogeneous broadening and the appearance of the normally-forbidden\ntransitions. Moreover, it is shown that from the main extend of the NMR spectra\nthe alloy mole fraction of a single QD can be inferred. By means of the\nelement-resolved NMR intensities it is found that In nuclei has a factor of\nfive dominance over those of As. In the presence of an external magnetic field,\nthe borderlines between the quadrupolar and Zeeman regimes are extracted as 1.5\nT for In and 1.1 T for As nuclei. At these values the nuclear spin\ndepolarization rates of the respective nuclei get maximized due to the\nnoncollinear secular hyperfine interaction with a resident electron in the QD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 07:39:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 11:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-02"}

The bar fraction in early type spirals ($Sa-Sb$) is $\\sim$50%, which\nis twice as high as the late type spirals ($Sbc-Sm$). The higher bar fraction\nin early type spirals may be due to the fact that a significant fraction of\ntheir bulges are pseudo-bulges which form via the buckling instability of a\nbar. i.e. a large part of the Hubble sequence is due to secular processes which\nmove disc galaxies from late to early types. There is a hint of a higher bar\nfraction with higher stellar masses which may be due to the susceptibility to\nbar instabilities as the baryon fractions increase in halos of larger masses.\nOverall, the $S0$ population has a lower bar fraction than the $Sa-Sb$ galaxies\nand their barred fraction drops significantly with decreasing stellar mass.\nThis supports the notion that $S0s$ form via the transformation of disk\ngalaxies that enter the cluster environment. The gravitational harassment\nthickens the stellar disks, wiping out spiral patterns and eventually erasing\nthe bar - a process that is more effective at lower galaxy masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 10:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}

The redshift evolution of the equation of state parameter\nw(z) for dark energy is characterized by two parameters, describing the\namplitude and the frequency of the oscillations. We consider six different\noscillating dark energy models, each characterized by a different set of\nparameter values. Under the common assumption that dark energy is not\nclustering on the scales of interest, we study different aspects of cosmic\nstructure formation. In particular, we self-consistently solve the spherical\ncollapse problem. We then estimate the behavior of several cosmological\nobservables, such as the linear growth factor, the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)\neffect, the number counts of massive structures, and the matter and cosmic\nshear power spectra. We show that, independently of the amplitude and the\nfrequency of the dark energy oscillations, none of the aforementioned\nobservables show an oscillating behavior as a function of redshift. This is a\nconsequence of the said observables' being integrals over some functions of the\nexpansion rate over cosmic history. We also notice that deviations with respect\nto the expectations for a fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology are generically small,\nand in the majority of the cases distinguishing an oscillating dark energy\nmodel would be difficult. Exceptions to this conclusion are provided by the\ncosmic shear power spectrum, which for some of the models shows a difference at\nthe level of \\sim 10% over a wide range of angular scales, and the abundance of\ngalaxy clusters, which is modified at the $\\sim 10-20%$ level at $z \\gtrsim\n0.6$ for future wide weak lensing surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 12:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 12:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The method consists in two steps: first, paths are sampled using a\ntransition path sampling (TPS) algorithm supplemented with a local Lyapunov\nbias favoring diverging trajectories. This enhances the probability of\nobserving rare reactive trajectories between stable states during relatively\nshort simulations. Secondly, reaction constants are eventually estimated from\nthe unbiased fraction of reactive paths, yielded by an appropriate statistical\ndata analysis tool, the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR) package.\n  In order to test our algorithm, we compute reaction constants for structural\ntransitions in LJ38, a well studied Lennard-Jones cluster, comparing our\nresults to values previously reported in the literature. Additionally, we apply\nour method to the calculation of reaction rates for vacancy migration in an\n{\\alpha}-Iron crystal, for temperatures ranging from 300 K to 850 K. Vacancy\ndiffusion rates associated with activation barriers at finite temperature are\nthen evaluated, and compared to values obtained using the standard harmonic\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 13:21:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 12:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

The\nrecent years have accumulated data which stress our incomplete understanding of\nthe nitrogen chemistry in dark cloud conditions. To tackle this problem of the\nnitrogen chemistry in cold gas, we have revised the formation of nitrogen\nhydrides, which is initiated by the key reaction \\ce{N+ + H2 -> NH+ + H}.

It is usually\nnecessary to realize these quantum manipulations in the shortest possible time\nin order to minimize decoherence, and with a large stability against\nfluctuations of the control parameters. While optimizing a protocol for speed\nleads to a natural lower bound in the form of the quantum speed limit rooted in\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle, stability against parameter variations\ntypically requires adiabatic following of the system. The ultimate goal in\nquantum control is to prepare a desired state with 100% fidelity. Here we\nexperimentally implement optimal control schemes that achieve nearly perfect\nfidelity for a two-level quantum system realized with Bose-Einstein condensates\nin optical lattices. By suitably tailoring the time-dependence of the system's\nparameters, we transform an initial quantum state into a desired final state\nthrough a short-cut protocol reaching the maximum speed compatible with the\nlaws of quantum mechanics. In the opposite limit we implement the recently\nproposed transitionless superadiabatic protocols, in which the system perfectly\nfollows the instantaneous adiabatic ground state.

These\nshare with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as\nasymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed\nrelation. My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ\nsubstantially from their \"modified-gravity\" (MG) kin in predicting other\nphenomena. Because MI theories are non local in time, MOND effects depend on\nthe full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG\ntheories. This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the\nexternal-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf\ngalaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may\nbe subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not\nonly on the instantaneous value. And, it is even possible to construct MI\ntheories with practically no EFE. Other predictions that may differ are also\ndiscussed. Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia\nformulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these\npoints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 15:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-30"}

Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation\n(EEHG) is a promising, recent technique for harmonic generation with an\nexcellent up-conversion to very high harmonics, from the standpoint of electron\nbeam physics. This paper explores the constraints on seed laser performance for\nreaching wavelengths of 1 nm. We show that the main challenge in implementing\nthe EEHG scheme at extreme harmonic factors is the requirement for accurate\ncontrol of temporal and spatial quality of the seed laser pulse. For example,\nif the phase of the laser pulse is chirped before conversion to an UV seed\npulse, the chirp in the electron beam microbunch turns out to be roughly\nmultiplied by the harmonic factor. In the case of a Ti:Sa seed laser, such\nfactor is about 800. For such large harmonic numbers, generation of nearly\ntransform-limited soft X-ray pulses results in challenging constraints on the\nTi:Sa laser. In fact, the relative discrepancy of the time-bandwidth product of\nthe seed-laser pulse from the ideal transform-limited performance should be no\nmore than one in a million. The generated electron beam microbunching is also\nvery sensitive to distortions of the seed laser wavefront, which are also\nmultiplied by the harmonic factor. In order to have minimal reduction of the\nFEL input coupling factor, it is desirable that the size-angular bandwidth\nproduct of the UV seed laser beam be very close to the ideal i.e.\ndiffraction-limited performance in the waist plane at the middle of the\nmodulator undulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 15:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}

These extend elementary root identities for polynomials both\nto more general functions and to a family of identities parametrised by a\ncomplex parameter \\mu. In so doing they equate one expression (the derivative\nside) which is defined via Fourier theory, with another (the root side) which\nis defined via remainder Cesaro summation.

Since the first experimental realization of optical bright\nsolitons in the anomalous dispersion single mode fibers (SMF) by Mollenauer et\nal. in 1980 and optical dark solitons in the normal dispersion SMFs by P.\nEmplit et al. in 1987, optical solitons in SMFs had been extensively\ninvestigated. In reality a SMF always supports two orthogonal polarization\nmodes. Taking fiber birefringence into account, it was later theoretically\npredicted that various types of vector solitons, including the bright-bright\nvector solitons, dark-dark vector solitons and dark-bright vector solitons,\ncould be formed in SMFs. However, except the bright-bright type of vector\nsolitons, other types of vector solitons are so far lack of clear experimental\nevidence. Optical solitons have been observed not only in the SMFs but also in\nmode locked fiber lasers. It has been shown that the passively mode-locked\nerbium-doped fiber lasers offer a promising experimental platform for studying\nthe scalar optical solitons. Vector solitons can also be formed in mode locked\nfiber lasers. In this dissertation, the author presents results of a series of\ntheoretical and experimental investigations on the vector solitons in fiber\nlasers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 09:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-22"}
