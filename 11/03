In our model, each link has unit\nprice and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its local\ndiameter or its total distance to other players in the (undirected) underlying\ngraph of the created network. Two versions of the game are studied: in the MAX\nversion, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the\nvertex and other vertices, and in the SUM version, the cost incurred to a\nvertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. We prove\nthat in both versions pure Nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding\nthe best response of a vertex is NP-hard. We take the social cost of the\ncreated network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible\ndiameter of an equilibrium graph with n vertices in various cases. When the sum\nof players' budgets is n-1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we\nprove that their maximum diameter is Theta(n) and Theta(log n) in MAX and SUM\nversions, respectively. When each vertex has unit budget (i.e. can establish\nlink to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either\nversion is Theta(1). We give examples of equilibrium graphs in the MAX version,\nsuch that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is\nOmega(sqrt(log n)). This interesting (and perhaps counter-intuitive) result\nshows that increasing the budgets may increase the diameter of equilibrium\ngraphs and hence deteriorate the network structure. Then we prove that every\nequilibrium graph in the SUM version has diameter 2^O(sqrt(log n)).

It is a well accepted point of\nview that flow in disordered media is occurring via local plastic events,\ncorresponding to small size rearrangements, that yield a long range stress\nredistribution over the system. Within a minimalistic mesoscopic model that\nincorporates these local dynamics, we study the spatial organisation of the\nlocal plastic events. The most important parameter in this study is the typical\nrestructuring time needed to regain the original structure after a local\nrearrangement. In agreement with a recent mean field study [Coussot \\textit{et\nal., Eur. Phys. J. E}, 2010, \\textbf{33}, 183] we observe a spontaneous\nformation of permanent shear bands, when this restructuring time is large\ncompared to the typical stress release time in a rearrangement. The bands\nconsist of a large number of plastic events within a solid region that remains\nelastic. This heterogeneous flow behaviour is different in nature from the\ntransient dynamical heterogeneities that one observes in the small shear rate\nlimit in flow without shear-banding [Martens \\textit{et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.},\n2011, \\textbf{106}, 156001]. We analyse in detail the dependence of the shear\nbands on system size, shear rate and restructuring time. Further we rationalise\nthe scenario within a mean field version of the spatial model, that produces a\nnon monotonous flow curve for large restructuring times. This explains the\ninstability of the homogeneous flow below a critical shear rate, that\ncorresponds to the minimum of the curve. Our study therefore strongly supports\nthe idea that the characteristic time scales involved in the local dynamics are\nat the physical origin of permanent shear bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 17:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 09:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-17"}

When going to\nvery small stellar populations, the stochastic sampling of the IMF will yield\nan inherent spread for the $M/L$ values, which will become probabilistic\nquantities. For the recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies,\nwith total luminosities dropping below 10^3 L_V/L_o, it is important to asses\nthe amplitude of the probabilistic spread in inherent $M/L$ values. The total\nbaryonic masses of these systems are usually estimated from their luminosities,\nassuming fixed, deterministic $M/L$ values, suitable for the infinite\npopulation limit. These total baryonic masses are crucial for the testing of\nstructure formation scenarios, as the local ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals\nrepresent the most extreme galactic scales known. Also subject to reliable\n$M/L$ values, is the use of these systems as possible discriminants between\ndark matter and modified gravity theories. By simulating large collections of\nstellar populations, each consisting of a particular collection of individual\nstars, we compute statistical distributions for the resulting $M/L$ values. For\ntotal numbers of stars in the range of what is observed for the ultra-faint\ndwarf spheroidals, inherent $M/L$ values of stellar populations can be expected\nto vary by factors of upwards of 3, interestingly, systematically skewed\ntowards higher values than what corresponds to the infinite population limit.\nThis can explain part of the spread in reported baryonic masses for these\nsystems, which also appear as shifted systematically towards high dark to\nbaryonic mass ratios at fixed stellar velocity dispersions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 18:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Bessel-weighted asymmetries are\nthus model independent observables that augment the description and our\nunderstanding of correlations of spin and momentum in nucleon structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 18:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Dark radiation from a decaying\nparticle can affect these two processes differently. Early decays add an\nadditional radiation component to both the CMB and BBN, while late decays can\nalter the radiation content seen in the CMB while having a negligible effect on\nBBN. Here we quantify this difference and explore the intermediate regime by\nexamining particles decaying during BBN, i.e., particle lifetimes \\tau_X\nsatisfying 0.1 sec < \\tau_X < 1000 sec. We calculate the change in the\neffective number of neutrino species, N_{eff}, as measured by the CMB, \\Delta\nN_{CMB}, and the change in the effective number of neutrino species as measured\nby BBN, \\Delta N_{BBN}, as a function of the decaying particle initial energy\ndensity and lifetime, where \\Delta N_{BBN} is defined in terms of the number of\nadditional two-component neutrinos needed to produce the same change in the\nprimordial helium-4 abundance as our decaying particle. As expected, for short\nlifetimes (\\tau_X < 0.1 sec), the particles decay before the onset of BBN, and\n\\Delta N_{CMB} = \\Delta N_{BBN}, while for long lifetimes (\\tau_X > 1000 sec),\n\\Delta N_{BBN} is dominated by the energy density of the nonrelativistic\nparticles before they decay, so that \\Delta N_{BBN} remains nonzero and becomes\nindependent of the particle lifetime. By varying both the particle energy\ndensity and lifetime, one can obtain any desired combination of \\Delta N_{BBN}\nand \\Delta N_{CMB}, subject to the constraint that \\Delta N_{CMB} >= \\Delta\nN_{BBN}. We present limits on the decaying particle parameters derived from\nobservational constraints on \\Delta N_{CMB} and \\Delta N_{BBN}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 18:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 18:44:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 21:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Recognizing that Schr\\\"odinger equation and a\nclassical random walk are both diffusion equations, it is possible to connect\nand compare them. Using similar parameters for both equations, we ran various\nsimulations aggregating particles.

The system is characterized\nby (a) a population of compact, low luminosity (~0.1 L*) sources --- 17\nprimarily young, small (Re~1-2 kpc), disky galaxies including an obscured AGN\n--- that are all substantially offset (>20 kpc) from the line-emitting nebula;\n(b) the lack of a central galaxy at or near the peak of the Lya emission; and\n(c) several nearly coincident, spatially extended emission components --- Lya,\nHeII, and UV continuum --- that are extremely smooth.

Strong electrical coupling synchronizes activity\nacross cell ensembles. Surprisingly, in the presence of noise synchronous\noscillations generated by an electrically coupled network may differ\nqualitatively from the oscillations produced by uncoupled individual cells\nforming the network. A prominent example of such behavior is the synchronized\nbursting in islets of Langerhans formed by pancreatic \\beta-cells, which in\nisolation are known to exhibit irregular spiking. At the heart of this\nintriguing phenomenon lies denoising, a remarkable ability of electrical\ncoupling to diminish the effects of noise acting on individual cells.\n  In this paper, we derive quantitative estimates characterizing denoising in\nelectrically coupled networks of conductance-based models of square wave\nbursting cells. Our analysis reveals the interplay of the intrinsic properties\nof the individual cells and network topology and their respective contributions\nto this important effect. In particular, we show that networks on graphs with\nlarge algebraic connectivity or small total effective resistance are better\nequipped for implementing denoising. As a by-product of the analysis of\ndenoising, we analytically estimate the rate with which trajectories converge\nto the synchronization subspace and the stability of the latter to random\nperturbations. These estimates reveal the role of the network topology in\nsynchronization. The analysis is complemented by numerical simulations of\nelectrically coupled conductance-based networks. Taken together, these results\nexplain the mechanisms underlying synchronization and denoising in an important\nclass of biological models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 20:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}

We\nmake use of ugriz CFHT MEGACAM photometry and VIMOS VLT spectroscopy to\nidentify structures around the RXJ1347 on a scale of 20x20 Mpc2. We construct\nmaps of the galaxy distribution and the fraction of blue galaxies. We study the\nphotometric galaxy properties as a function of environment, traced by the\ngalaxy density. We identify group candidates based on galaxy overdensities and\nstudy their galaxy content. We also use available GALEX NUV imaging to identify\nstrong unobscured star forming galaxies. We find that the large scale structure\naround RXJ1347 extends in the NE-SW direction for at least 20 Mpc, in which\nmost of the group candidates are located. As other studies, we find that the\nfraction of blue galaxies (Fblue) is a function of galaxy number density, but\nthe bulk of the trend is due to galaxies belonging to massive systems. The\nfraction of the UV-bright galaxies is also function of environment, but their\nrelative numbers compared to the blue population seems to be constant\nregardless of the environment. These UV emitters also have similar properties\nat all galaxy densities, indicating that the transition between galaxy types\noccurs in short time-scales. Candidate galaxy groups show a large variation in\ntheir galaxy content and Fblue in those groups display little dependence with\ngalaxy density. This may indicate possible differences in their evolutionary\nstatus or the processes that are acting in groups are different than in\nclusters. The large scale structure around rich clusters are dynamic places for\ngalaxy evolution. In the case of RXJ1347 the transformation may start within\ninfalling groups to finish with the removal of the cold gas once galaxies are\naccreted in massive systems.

We recast this problem as\na question of finding a low-dimensional subspace H, spanned by rank 1 tensors,\nsuch that any non-zero tensor in the dual space ker(H) has high rank. We obtain\nexplicit constructions of essentially optimal-size hitting sets for tensors of\ndegree 2 (matrices), and obtain quasi-polynomial sized hitting sets for\narbitrary tensors (but this second hitting set is less explicit).\n  We also show connections to the task of performing low-rank recovery of\nmatrices, which is studied in the field of compressed sensing.

We obtain this\nreduction using linear-algebraic techniques, and not using convex optimization,\nwhich is more commonly seen in compressed sensing algorithms. By using a dual\nReed-Solomon code, we are able to (deterministically) construct low-rank\nrecovery schemes taking 4nr measurements over the reals, such that the\nmeasurements can be all rank-1 matrices, or all sparse matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 21:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-03"}

The proofs\nutilized carefully constructed induction arguments, for which the classical\nsubset entropy inequality of Han (1978) played a key role. This paper includes\ntwo parts.

In statistical language, one would say that an\nunderdog must be willing to adopt a strategy whose outcome has a\nlarger-than-average variance. The difficult question is how much risk a team\nshould be willing to accept. This is equivalent to asking how much the team\nshould be willing to sacrifice from its mean score in order to increase the\nscore's variance. In this paper a general, analytical method is developed for\naddressing this question quantitatively.

The extragalactic fluctuations are also\ninteresting in their own right as they depend on the star formation history of\nthe Universe and the way in which this connects with the formation of cosmic\nstructure. We present a new framework which allows us to predict the occupation\nof dark matter haloes by star-forming galaxies and uses this information, in\nconjunction with an N-body simulation of structure formation, to predict the\npower spectrum of intensity fluctuations in the infrared background. We compute\nthe emission from galaxies at far-infrared, millimetre and radio wavelengths.\nOur method gives accurate predictions for the clustering of galaxies both for\nthe one halo and two halo terms. We illustrate our new framework using a\npreviously published model which reproduces the number counts and redshift\ndistribution of galaxies selected by their emission at $850\\,\\mu$m. Without\nadjusting any of the model parameters, the predictions show encouraging\nagreement at high frequencies and on small angular scales with recent estimates\nof the extragalactic fluctuations in the background made from early data\nanalysed by the Planck Collaboration.

The\nfractional number of modes with frequency less than $\\omega$ varies as $\\exp\n(-C/\\omega)$ for $\\omega$ tending to zero, where $C$ is a constant. For an\nunbiased random walk on the vertices of this graph, this implies that the\nprobability of return to the origin at time $t$ varies as $\\exp(- C' t^{1/3})$,\nfor large $t$, where $C'$ is a constant. For the spherical model, we show that\nwhile the critical exponents take the values expected from the mean-field\ntheory, the free-energy per site at temperature $T$, near and above the\ncritical temperature $T_c$, also has an essential singularity of the type\n$\\exp[ -K {(T - T_c)}^{-1/2}]$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 07:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 06:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-03"}

Usually the origin is\ninferred by running a trajectory model (stochastic or deterministic) in\nreverse. However, this approach has some severe drawbacks, most notably the\nfact that many drifting objects go through nonlinear state changes underway\n(e.g., evaporating oil or a capsizing lifeboat). This makes it difficult to\nnaively construct a reverse-time trajectory model which realistically predicts\nthe earliest possible time the object may have started drifting. We propose\ninstead a different approach where the original (forward) trajectory model is\nkept unaltered while an iterative seeding and selection process allows us to\nretain only those particles that end up within a certain time-space radius of\nthe observation. An iterative refinement process named BAKTRAK is employed\nwhere those trajectories that do not make it to the goal are rejected and new\ntrajectories are spawned from successful trajectories. This allows the model to\nbe run in the forward direction to determine the point of origin of a drifting\nobject. The method is demonstrated using the Leeway stochastic trajectory model\nfor drifting objects due to its relative simplicity and the practical\nimportance of being able to identify the origin of drifting objects. However,\nthe methodology is general and even more applicable to oil drift trajectories,\ndrifting ships and hazardous material that exhibit non-linear state changes\nsuch as evaporation, chemical weathering, capsizing or swamping. The\nbacktracking method is tested against the drift trajectory of a life raft and\nis shown to predict closely the initial release position of the raft and its\nsubsequent trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 08:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

We study some of the recently proposed\npolarisation observables involving the decay products of the top quark in the\ncontext of $H^-t$ and $Wt$ production. We show that the effect of the top\npolarisation on the decay lepton azimuthal angle distribution, studied recently\nfor these processes at leading order in QCD, is robust with respect to the\ninclusion of next-to-leading order and parton shower corrections. We also\nconsider the leptonic polar angle, as well as recently proposed energy-related\ndistributions of the top decay products.

However, there\nstill remains the crucial challenge of simultaneously closing all major\nloopholes - the locality, freedom-of-choice, and detection loopholes - in a\nsingle experiment. An important sub-class of local realistic theories can be\ntested with the concept of \"steering\". The term steering was introduced by\nSchr\\\"odinger in 1935 for the fact that entanglement would seem to allow an\nexperimenter to remotely steer the state of a distant system as in the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument. Einstein called this \"spooky action at\na distance\". EPR-Steering has recently been rigorously formulated as a quantum\ninformation task opening it up to new experimental tests. Here, we present the\nfirst loophole-free demonstration of EPR-steering by violating three-setting\nquadratic steering inequality, tested with polarization entangled photons\nshared between two distant laboratories. Our experiment demonstrates this\neffect while simultaneously closing all loopholes: both the locality loophole\nand a specific form of the freedom-of-choice loophole are closed by having a\nlarge separation of the parties and using fast quantum random number\ngenerators, and the fair-sampling loophole is closed by having high overall\ndetection efficiency. Thereby, we exclude - for the first time loophole-free -\nan important class of local realistic theories considered by EPR. As well as\nits foundational importance, loop-hole-free steering also allows the\ndistribution of quantum entanglement secure from an untrusted party.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 09:07:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 16:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 11:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}

Tuning the gauge field\nstrength, the system undergoes stepwise transitions between different ground\nstates, which we describe by analytical trial wave functions, amongst them the\nPfaffian, the Laughlin, and a Laughlin quasiparticle many-body state. The\nadiabatic following of the center of mass movement by the lowest energy dressed\ninternal state, is lost by the mixing of the second internal state. This\nmixture can be controlled by the intensity of the laser field. The\nnon-adiabaticity is inherent to the considered setup, and is shown to play the\nrole of circular asymmetry. We study its influence on the properties of the\nground state of the system. Its main effect is to reduce the overlap of the\nnumerical solutions with the analytical trial expressions by occupying states\nwith higher angular momentum. Thus, we propose generalized wave functions\narising from the Laughlin and Pfaffian wave function by including components,\nwhere extra Jastrow factors appear, while preserving important features of\nthese states.

Pulsar magnetic field\ngeometries, such as the retarded vacuum dipole and force-free magnetospheres\nhave distorted polar caps that are offset from the magnetic axis in the\ndirection opposite to rotation. Since this effect is due to the sweepback of\nfield lines near the light cylinder, offset polar caps are a generic property\nof pulsar magnetospheres and their effects should be included in gamma-ray\npulsar light curve modeling. In slot gap models (having two-pole caustic\ngeometry), the offset polar caps cause a strong azimuthal asymmetry of the\nparticle acceleration around the magnetic axis. We have studied the effect of\nthe offset polar caps in both retarded vacuum dipole and force-free geometry on\nthe model high-energy pulse profiles. We find that, compared to the profiles\nderived from symmetric caps, the flux in the pulse peaks, which are caustics\nformed along the trailing magnetic field lines, increases significantly\nrelative to the off-peak emission, formed along leading field lines. The\nenhanced contrast produces improved slot gap model fits to Fermi pulsar light\ncurves like Vela, with vacuum dipole fits being more favorable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 13:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-04"}

In a discrete event driven simulation, the\nassignment of logical processes (LPs) to machines is a critical step that\naffects the computational and communication burden on the machines, which in\nturn affects the simulation execution time of the experiment. We study a\nnetwork partitioning game wherein each node (LP) acts as a selfish player. We\nderive two local node-level cost frameworks which are feasible in the sense\nthat the aggregate state information required to be exchanged between the\nmachines is independent of the size of the simulated network model. For both\ncost frameworks, we prove the existence of stable Nash equilibria in pure\nstrategies. Using iterative partition improvements, we propose game theoretic\npartitioning algorithms based on the two cost criteria and show that each\ndescends in a global cost. To exploit the distributed nature of the system, the\nalgorithm is distributed, with each node's decision based on its local\ninformation and on a few global quantities which can be communicated\nmachine-to-machine. We demonstrate the performance of our partitioning\nalgorithm on an optimistic discrete event driven simulation platform that\nmodels an actual parallel simulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 15:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2012 23:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-16"}

The electrons giving rise to the observed \\g-rays are efficiently cooled\nby Compton scattering, and the power-law index of the acceleration process is ~\n2.5--3.

There may be interesting end-to-end transmission\nopportunities through other nearby nodes. Existing protocols miss such\npossibilities by maintaining a simple contact-based view of the network. In\nthis paper, we investigate how the vicinity of a node evolves through time and\nwhether such information can be useful when routing data.

As the universe contracts, the amplitude of such\nperturbations are amplified. The gauge invariant variable $\\Phi$ develops a\ngrowing mode which becomes much larger than the constant one around the bounce\nphase. The constant mode has its amplitude fixed by Cosmic Background Explorer\n(COBE) normalization, thus the amplitude of the growing mode can become much\nlarger than 1. In this paper, we first show that this is a general feature of\nbouncing models, since we expect that general relativity should be valid in all\nscales away from the bounce. However, in the Newtonian gauge, the variable\n$\\Phi$ gives the value of the metric perturbation $\\phi$, raising doubts on the\nvalidity of the linear perturbative regime at the bounce. In order to address\nthis issue, we obtain a set of necessary conditions for the perturbative series\nto be valid along the whole history of the model, and we show that there is a\ngauge in which all these conditions are satisfied, for a set of models, if the\nconstant mode is fixed by COBE normalization.

We find a\nqualitative agreement of the momentum resolved spectral function with\nangle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) and former LDA+DMFT results. As a\ncorrection to LDA+DMFT, we observe more pronounced coherent peaks below the\nFermi level, as indicated by ARPES experiments. In addition, we resolve the\nspectral functions in the ${\\bf K}_{0}=(0,0,0)$ and ${\\bf K}_{1}=(\\pi,\\pi,\\pi)$\nsectors of DCA, where band insulating and metallic phases coexist.

In particular, by removing\nthe electron from a \"removal orbital\" of appropriate symmetry that is\nconcentrated in the asymptotic region, one obtains the exact ionization\npotential and the exact Dyson orbital for the corresponding state of the ion.\nIt is argued that the EKT is not restricted to many-electron systems but holds\nfor any finite many-body system, provided the interaction vanishes for\nincreasing interparticle distance. A necessary and sufficient condition for the\nvalidity of the extended Koopmans' theorem for any state (not just the\nlowest-energy states of a given symmetry) in terms of the third-order reduced\ndensity matrix is stated and derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 15:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-04"}

We investigate the effect of the\nquasiperiodic forcing on this period-doubling route to chaotic oscillation. In\ncontrast to the case of periodic forcing, new type of strange nonchaotic (SN)\noscillating states (that are geometrically strange but have no positive\nLyapunov exponents) are found to exist between the regular and chaotic\noscillating states as intermediate ones. Their strange fractal geometry leads\nto aperiodic \"complex\" spikings. Various dynamical routes to SN oscillations\nare identified, as in the quasiperiodically forced logistic map. These SN\nspikings are expected to be observed in experiments of the quasiperiodically\nforced squid giant axon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 03:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}
