The energy spectrum, mass composition, and anisotropy in arrival\ndirections of ultra-high energy cosmic rays are discussed. The energy spectrum\nof cosmic rays with energies above $10^{18}$ eV is determined using the data of\nthe fluorescence detectors, surface detectors, and with a hybrid shower\nreconstruction technique using the both data. The ankle structure is clearly\nfound at $10^{18.7}$ eV. The second bending point is also identified, at which\nthe flux of cosmic rays begins to decrease and the spectral index changes from\n$E^{-2.68}$ to $E^{-4.2}$. The study of shower development using the\nfluorescence detector data shows that proton is dominant in cosmic rays above\n$10^{18.2}$ eV.

SN 1987A and other similar objects exhibit\nproperties that distinguish them from ordinary Type II Plateau (IIP) SNe, whose\nprogenitors are believed to be red supergiants (RSGs). Similarities among\n1987A-like events include a long rise to maximum, early luminosity fainter than\nthat of normal Type IIP SNe, and radioactivity acting as the primary source\npowering the light curves. We present and analyze two SNe monitored by the\nCarnegie Supernova Project that are reminiscent of SN 1987A. Optical and\nnear-infrared (NIR) light curves, and optical spectroscopy of SNe 2006V and\n2006au are presented. These observations are compared to those of SN 1987A, and\nare used to estimate properties of their progenitors. Both objects exhibit a\nslow rise to maximum and light curve evolution similar to that of SN 1987A. At\nthe earliest epochs, SN 2006au also displays an initial dip which we interpret\nas the signature of the adiabatic cooling phase that ensues shock break- out.\nSNe 2006V and 2006au are both found to be bluer, hotter and brighter than SN\n1987A. Spectra of SNe 2006V and 2006au are similar to those of SN 1987A and\nother normal Type II objects, although both consistently exhibit expansion\nvelocities higher than SN 1987A. Semi-analytic models are fit to the UVOIR\nlight curve of each object from which physical properties of the progenitors\nare estimated. This yields ejecta mass estimates of about 20 solar masses,\nexplosion energies of 2 - 3 x 10^51 erg, and progenitor radii of 75 - 100 solar\nradii for both SNe. The progenitors of SNe 2006V and 2006au were most likely\nBSGs with a larger explosion energy as compared to that of SN 1987A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 16:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Until very recently, observed samples of PCEBs\nhave been too small to fully explore this potential, however the recently\nidentified large and relatively homogenous sample of PCEBs from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) has significantly changed this situation. We here\nanalyze the orbital period distributions of PCEBs containing He- and C/O-core\nWDs separately and investigate whether the orbital period of PCEBs is related\nto the masses of their stellar components. We performed standard statistical\ntests to compare the orbital period distributions and to determine the\nconfidence levels of possible relations. The orbital periods of PCEBs\ncontaining He-core WDs are significantly shorter than those of PCEBs containing\nC/O-core WDs. While the He-core PCEB orbital period distribution has a median\nvalue of Porb ~ 0.28 d, the median orbital period for PCEBs containing C/O-core\nWDs is Porb ~ 0.57 d. We also find that systems containing more massive\nsecondaries have longer post-CE orbital periods, in contradiction to recent\npredictions.

Traditional explanations of gas ejection\nequate the energy required to escape the galaxy or host halo to an estimate for\nthe energy yield from supernovae. This yield is usually assumed to be a\nconstant fraction of the total available from the supernova, or is derived from\nthe assumption of a consistent momentum yield. By applying these ideas in the\ncontext of a cold dark matter cosmogony, we derive a 1st-order analytic\nconnection between these working assumptions and the expected relationship\nbetween baryon content and galaxy circular velocity, and find that these quick\npredictions straddle recent observational estimates. To examine the premises\nbehind these theories in more detail, we then explore their applicability to a\nset of gasdynamical simulations of idealised galaxies. We show that different\npremises dominate to differing degrees in the simulated outflow, depending on\nthe mass of the system and the resolution with which it is simulated. Using\nthis study to anticipate the emergent behaviour at arbitrarily high resolution,\nwe motivate more comprehensive analytic model which allows for the range of\nvelocities with which the gas may exit the system, and incorporates both\nmomentum and energy-based constraints on the outflow. Using a trial exit\nvelocity distribution, this is shown to be compatible with the observed baryon\nfractions in intermediate-mass systems, but implies that current estimates for\nlow-mass systems can not be solely accounted for by supernova winds under\ncommonly-held assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 17:28:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 11:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We consider either finite or source-transitive graphs,\ni.e., graphs that are identical when viewed from a(ny) source. We assume\nstochastic, individual-based, density-independent reproduction and dispersal.\nBy studying the path of a single random disperser, we are able to display\nsimple criteria for persistence, either necessary and sufficient, or just\nsufficient.

We find that\nnon-adiabatic initial conditions leave the sound speed unchanged but instead\nexcite different harmonics. These harmonics couple differently to Silk damping,\naltering the form and evolution of acoustic waves in the baryon-photon fluid\nprior to decoupling. This modifies not only the scale on which the sound waves\nimprint onto the baryon distribution, which is used as the standard ruler in\nBAO surveys, but also the shape, width and height of the BAO peak.

However, small numbers of stars in\nthese regions with inferred ages of >= 5-10 Myr have been cited to argue that\nstar formation is instead a slow, quasi-static process. When considering these\nalternative pictures it is important to recognize that the age spread in a\ngiven star-forming cloud is necessarily an upper limit to the timescales of\nlocal collapse, as not all spatially-distinct regions will start contracting at\nprecisely the same instant. Moreover, star-forming clouds may dynamically\nevolve on timescales of a few Myr; in particular, global gravitational\ncontraction will tend to yield increasing star formation rates with time due to\ngenerally increasing local gas densities. We show that two different numerical\nsimulations of dynamic, flow-driven molecular cloud formation and evolution 1)\npredict age spreads for the main stellar population roughly consistent with\nobservations, and 2) raise the possibility of forming small numbers of stars\nearly in cloud evolution, before global contraction concentrates the gas and\nthe bulk of the stellar population is produced. In general, the existence of a\nsmall number of older stars among a generally much-younger population is\nconsistent with the picture of dynamic star formation, and may even provide\nclues to the time evolution of star-forming clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 20:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

As a large fraction of the population will be exposed to\nradiation, low-dose imaging is essential. Iterative image reconstruction based\non solving an optimization problem, such as Total-Variation minimization, shows\npotential for reconstruction from sparse-view data. For iterative methods it is\nimportant to ensure convergence to an accurate solution, since important image\nfeatures, such as presence of microcalcifications indicating breast cancer, may\nnot be visible in a non-converged reconstruction, and this can have clinical\nsignificance. To prevent excessively long computational times, which is a\npractical concern for the large image arrays in CT, it is desirable to keep the\nnumber of iterations low, while still ensuring a sufficiently accurate\nreconstruction for the specific imaging task. This motivates the study of\naccurate convergence criteria for iterative image reconstruction. In simulation\nstudies with a realistic breast phantom with microcalcifications we compare\ndifferent convergence criteria for reliable reconstruction. Our results show\nthat it can be challenging to ensure a sufficiently accurate microcalcification\nreconstruction, when using standard convergence criteria. In particular, the\ngray level of the small microcalcifications may not have converged long after\nthe background tissue is reconstructed uniformly.

The principal difficulty in implementing such a system is that, due to\nthe limited attenuation between the relay's transmit and receive antenna\narrays, the relay's outgoing signal may overwhelm its limited-dynamic-range\ninput circuitry, making it difficult---if not impossible---to recover the\ndesired incoming signal. While explicitly modeling transmitter/receiver\ndynamic-range limitations and channel estimation error, we derive tight upper\nand lower bounds on the end-to-end achievable rate of decode-and-forward-based\nfull-duplex MIMO relay systems, and propose a transmission scheme based on\nmaximization of the lower bound. The maximization requires us to (numerically)\nsolve a nonconvex optimization problem, for which we detail a novel approach\nbased on bisection search and gradient projection. To gain insights into system\ndesign tradeoffs, we also derive an analytic approximation to the achievable\nrate and numerically demonstrate its accuracy. We then study the behavior of\nthe achievable rate as a function of signal-to-noise ratio,\ninterference-to-noise ratio, transmitter/receiver dynamic range, number of\nantennas, and training length, using optimized half-duplex signaling as a\nbaseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 21:26:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 18:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 02:34:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 15:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Data can be aggregated by home area network,\nbuilding area network and neighboring area network in such a way that the\nprivacy of customers is protected. We use homomorphic encryption technique to\nachieve this. The consumer data that is collected is sent to the substations\nwhere it is monitored by remote terminal units (RTU). The proposed access\ncontrol mechanism gives selective access to consumer data stored in data\nrepositories and used by different smart grid users. Users can be maintenance\nunits, utility centers, pricing estimator units or analyzing and prediction\ngroups. We solve this problem of access control using cryptographic technique\nof attribute-based encryption. RTUs and users have attributes and cryptographic\nkeys distributed by several key distribution centers (KDC). RTUs send data\nencrypted under a set of attributes. Users can decrypt information provided\nthey have valid attributes. The access control scheme is distributed in nature\nand does not rely on a single KDC to distribute keys. Bobba \\emph{et al.}\n\\cite{BKAA09} proposed an access control scheme, which relies on a centralized\nKDC and is thus prone to single-point failure. The other requirement is that\nthe KDC has to be online, during data transfer which is not required in our\nscheme. Our access control scheme is collusion resistant, meaning that users\ncannot collude and gain access to data, when they are not authorized to access.\nWe theoretically analyze our schemes and show that the computation overheads\nare low enough to be carried out in smart grids. To the best of our knowledge,\nours is the first work on smart grids, which integrates these two important\nsecurity components (privacy preserving data aggregation and access control)\nand presents an overall security architecture in smart grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 21:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-14"}

At 15.3 pc, the minimal astrometric amplitude for planet candidate\nGJ 317b is 0.3 milliarcseconds (edge-on orbit), just below our astrometric\nsensitivity.

We examine a common scenario in which only participants\nthat are aware of the information can compete for some reward, and thus\ninformed participants have an incentive not to propagate information to others.\nOne recent example in which such tension arises is the 2009 DARPA Network\nChallenge (finding red balloons). We focus on another prominent example:\nBitcoin, a decentralized electronic currency system.\n  Bitcoin represents a radical new approach to monetary systems. It has been\ngetting a large amount of public attention over the last year, both in policy\ndiscussions and in the popular press. Its cryptographic fundamentals have\nlargely held up even as its usage has become increasingly widespread. We find,\nhowever, that it exhibits a fundamental problem of a different nature, based on\nhow its incentives are structured. We propose a modification to the protocol\nthat can eliminate this problem.\n  Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network to track transactions that are\nperformed with the currency. For this purpose, every transaction a node learns\nabout should be transmitted to its neighbors in the network. The current\nimplemented protocol provides an incentive to nodes to not broadcast\ntransactions they are aware of. Our solution is to augment the protocol with a\nscheme that rewards information propagation. Since clones are easy to create in\nthe Bitcoin system, an important feature of our scheme is Sybil-proofness.\n  We show that our proposed scheme succeeds in setting the correct incentives,\nthat it is Sybil-proof, and that it requires only a small payment overhead, all\nthis is achieved with iterated elimination of dominated strategies. We\ncomplement this result by showing that there are no reward schemes in which\ninformation propagation and no self-cloning is a dominant strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 22:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 07:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

In the case of a\nhydrogen-rich atmosphere, molecular absorption and scattering processes may\nresult in detectable radius variations as a function of wavelength. The aim of\nthis paper is to measure these variations. We have obtained observations of the\ntransit of GJ1214b in the r- and I-band with the INT, in the g, r, i and z\nbands with the 2.2 meter MPI/ESO telescope, in the Ks-band with the NOT, and in\nthe Kc-band with the WHT. By comparing the transit depth between the the\ndifferent bands, which is a measure for the planet-to-star size ratio, the\natmosphere is investigated. We do not detect clearly significant variations in\nthe planet-to-star size ratio as function of wavelength. Although the ratio at\nthe shortest measured wavelength, in g-band, is 2sigma larger than in the other\nbands. The uncertainties in the Ks and Kc bands are large, due to systematic\nfeatures in the light curves. The tentative increase in the planet-to-star size\nratio at the shortest wavelength could be a sign of an increase in the\neffective planet-size due to Rayleigh scattering, which would require GJ1214b\nto have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. If true, then the atmosphere has to have\nboth clouds, to suppress planet-size variations at red optical wavelengths, as\nwell as a sub-solar metallicity, to suppress strong molecular features in the\nnear- and mid-infrared. However, star spots, which are known to be present on\nthe hoststar's surface, can (partly) cancel out the expected variations in\nplanet-to-star size ratio, due to the lower surface temperature of the spots .\nA hypothetical spot-fraction of 10% would be able to raise the infrared points\nsufficiently with respect to the optical measurements to be inconsistent with a\nwater-dominated atmosphere.

This implies an ambiguity in the definition of the pion and\npion decay constant for all Ginsparg-Wilson expressions of the Dirac operator,\nincluding the overlap operator. We use a renormalisation group mapping\nprocedure to consider local chiral symmetry transformations for a continuum\nGinsparg-Wilson \"Dirac-operator.\" We find that this naturally leads to an\nexpression for the conserved current that differs from the standard expression\nby cut-off artefacts, but is independent of which of the Ginsparg-Wilson\nsymmetries is chosen.

This generates an electric current in the loop\nwhich can be measured precisely by sensitive electronics. For that task the\nantenna consists of two superconducting loops parallel to each other. One of\nthem, the primary loop, rotationally oscillates because of the described\nreasons, while the second stays at rest. In the oscillating loop the current\ncreates an oscillating magnetic flux. This flux should be compensated due to\nfluxoid quantization, by the oppositely directed current in the non-moving,\nsecondary loop, in which the ions are at rest, and the Cooper pairs move. We\nestimate the resulting signal/noise ratio and discuss the signal detectability.\nSeveral designs are envisioned, both for terrestrial and for orbital\narrangements of the antenna.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 03:48:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 18:23:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2013 14:26:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 03:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

Within the framework of classical error models, the\ndependent variable relates to the independent variable according to the usual\nadditive model. The classes of linear models considered are regression lines in\nthe limit of uncorrelated errors in X and in Y. For homoscedastic data, the\nresults are taken from earlier attempts and rewritten using a more compact\nnotation. For heteroscedastic data, the results are inferred from a procedure\nrelated to functional models. An example of astronomical application is\nconsidered, concerning the [O/H]-[Fe/H] empirical relations deduced from five\nsamples related to different stars and/or different methods of oxygen abundance\ndetermination. For low-dispersion samples and assigned methods, different\nregression models yield results which are in agreement within the errors for\nboth heteroscedastic and homoscedastic data, while the contrary holds for\nlarge-dispersion samples. In any case, samples related to different methods\nproduce discrepant results, due to the presence of (still undetected)\nsystematic errors, which implies no definitive statement can be made at\npresent. Asymptotic expressions approximate regression line slope and intercept\nvariance estimators, for normal residuals, to a better extent with respect to\nearlier attempts.

As shown by Bell [1] and Kochen-Specker [2], quantum mechanics\nportrays a picture of the world in which reality loses its objectivity and is\nin fact created by observation. Quantum mechanics predicts phenomena which\ncannot be explained by any theory with objective realism, although our everyday\nexperience supports the hypothesis that macroscopic objects, despite being made\nof quantum particles, exist independently of the act of observation; in this\npaper we identify this behavior as classical. Here we show that this seemingly\nobvious classical behavior of the macroscopic world cannot be experimentally\ntested and belongs to the realm of ontology similar to the dispute on the\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics [3,4]. For small systems such as a single\nphoton [5] or a pair [6], it has been experimentally proven that a classical\ndescription cannot be sustained. Recently, there have also been experiments\nthat claim to have demonstrated quantum behavior of relatively large objects\nsuch as interference of fullerenes [7], the violation of Leggett-Garg\ninequality in Josephson junction [8], and interference between two condensed\nclouds of atoms [9], which suggest that there is no limit to the size of the\nsystem on which the quantum-versus-classical question can be tested. These\nbehaviors, however, are not sufficient to refute classical description in the\nsense of objective reality. Our findings show that once we reach the regime\nwhere an Avogadro number of particles is present, the quantum-versus-classical\nquestion cannot be answered experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 10:06:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 11:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

The outburst\nemission shows instead remarkable changes: H2O and OH line fluxes increase, new\nOH, H2, and HI transitions are detected, and organics are no longer seen.

Using H2O lines that can be approximated as thermalized to a\nsingle temperature, our results are consistent with a column density decrease\nin outburst while the emitting area of warm gas increases.

We present a determination of the intrinsic colors and ages of galaxies\nat very high redshift, in particular old galaxies (OGs) within extremely red\nobjects (EROs). To date, the definition of EROs has been restricted to objects\nwith z<2.5, however, here consider objects with the same properties but shifted\nto higher redshifts (z>2.5). We therefore, refer to these objects as very\nhigh-redshift EROs (Z-EROS, herein). Methods. We analyze 63,550 galaxies\nselected in the XMM-LSS field. To obtain a reasonably sized sample of EROs, it\nis essential to consider a very wide area surveys. We identify targets within\nan area of 0.77 square degrees for which optical to mid-infrared data are\navailable from SUBARU, UKIDSS, and Spitzer. We select Z-EROs based on their\ncolors, and then perform a selection of only OGs. One of our novel innovations\nis to adapt the traditional method of EROs selection based on the filters I and\nK, to higher redshifts. Using our method, we identify 20 objects that satisfy\nthe conditions required to be Z-EROs/OGs at redshifts 2.5<z<3.8 within some\nconservative constraints of errors in the photometric redshifts. For each of\nthese objects, we calculate the corresponding color at rest (B-V), and estimate\ntheir average stellar mass and age by comparing this color with a synthesis\nmodel. Results. Our selected galaxies have high stellar masses (~10^{11} M_sun)\nand are older than 1 Gyr, hence their stellar populations were formed at\nz>~4.7. After including additional galaxies with z<2.5 analyzed in a previous\npaper, we find that the formation epoch depends significantly on the observed\nredshift and stellar mass: the higher the stellar mass, the lower the age of\nthe Universe at which it was formed.

The observed SED\nvariations are usually assumed to be a result of inhomogeneous surface\ndistribution of chemical elements, flux redistribution and stellar rotation.\nHowever, the direct evidence for this is still only scarce. We aim to identify\nthe processes that determine the SED and its variability in the UV and visual\nspectral domains of the helium-weak star CU Vir. We used the model atmospheres\nto obtain the emergent flux and predict the rotationally modulated flux\nvariability of the star. We show that most of the light variations in the vby\nfilters of the Stromgren photometric system are a result of the uneven surface\ndistribution of silicon, chromium, and iron. Our models are only able to\nexplain a part of the variability in the u filter, however. The observed UV\nflux distribution is very well reproduced, and the models are able to explain\nmost of the observed features in the UV light curve. The variability observed\nin the visible is merely a faint gleam of that in the UV. While the amplitude\nof the light curves reaches only several hundredths of magnitude in the visual\ndomain, it reaches about 1 mag in the UV. The visual and UV light variability\nof CU Vir is caused by the flux redistribution from the far UV to near UV and\nvisible regions, inhomogeneous distribution of the elements and stellar\nrotation. Bound-free transitions of silicon and bound-bound transitions of iron\nand chromium contribute the most to the flux redistribution. This mechanism can\nexplain most of the rotationally modulated light variations in the filters\ncentred on the Paschen continuum and on the UV continuum of the star CU Vir.\nHowever, another mechanism(s) has to be invoked to fully explain the observed\nlight variations in the u filter and in the region 2000-2500 A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 14:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This\nring overlaps with a previously established star-forming ring detected with\nPa_alpha and radio continuum observations, but peaks outside it, especially if\ndetermined using the PAH equivalent width. Using the characteristics of the PAH\nemission and the ionised gas emission we argue that NGC 1614 features an\noutward propagating ring of star formation, where the equivalent width of the\nPAH emission localises the regions where the current star formation is just\nexpanding into the molecular gas outward of the nucleus. The core itself shows\na highly luminous, slightly resolved (at ~80 pc) L-band continuum source. We\nfind no evidence of AGN activity and rule out the presence of an obscured AGN\nusing L-band diagnostics. Furthermore, we detect the likely companion galaxy\nfrom archival HST/ACS imaging. The star formation and dynamical characteristics\nof the system are consistent with a relatively major merger just after its\nsecond passage. An outstanding question is how a gas-rich advanced merger such\nas this one, with strong LIRG level nuclear starburst and major merger-like\ntidal features, has not yet developed an active nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 14:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-14"}

To fix this deficiency, we modify\nthe amplitudes of the signals of the L and H states and achieve an exponential\nspeedup compared to the old situation. Another improvement concerns the\nidentification of a single product (hyperspace) state. We introduce a time\nshifted noise-based logic, which is constructed by shifting each reference\nsignal with a small time delay.
