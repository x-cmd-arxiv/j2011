By adopting suitable representations of\nthe Dirac matrices in higher dimensions, we pursue the investigation of which\nhigher dimensional space-times and which mass-shell relation concerning\nmassless Dirac equations in higher dimensions may induce massive spinors in\nD=1+3. The mixing of the chiral fermions in higher dimensions may induce a\nmechanism such that four massive Majorana fermions may show up and, at an\nappropriate limit an almost zero and a huge mass show up with corresponding\nleft-handed and right-handed eigenstates. This mechanism, in a peculiar way,\ncould reassess the See-Saw scheme associated to neutrino with Majorana-type\nmasses. Remarkably the masses of the particles are fixed by the dimension\ndecoupling/reduction scheme based on the mass Lorentz invariant term, where one\nset of the decoupled dimensions are the \"target\" coordinates frame and the\nother set of coordinates is the composing block of the mass term in lower\ndimensions. This proposal should allow us to understand the generation of\nhierarchies, such as the fourth generation, for the fermionic masses in D=1+3,\nor in lower dimensions in general, starting from the constraints between the\nenergy and the momentum in D=n+n. For the initial D=5+5 Majorana-Weyl spinors\nframework using the Weyl representation to the Dirac matrices we observe an\nintriguing decomposition of space-time that result in two very equivalent D=1+4\nmassive spinors which mass term, in D=1+3 included, is originated from the\nremained/decoupled component and that could induce a Brane-World mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 16:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

We analysed\nthe effect of high density environments on different classes of galaxy-galaxy\ninteractions and we have also studied the impact of the group global\nenvironment on pair galaxies. We find that galaxy pairs are more concentrated\ntowards the group centres with respect to the other group galaxy members, and\ndisturbed pairs show a preference to contain the brightest galaxy in the\ngroups. The color-magnitude relation exhibits significant differences between\npair galaxies and the control sample, consisting in color tails with a clear\nexcess of extremely blue and red galaxies for merging systems. In addition,\npair galaxies show a significant excess of young stellar populations with\nrespect to galaxies in the control sample; this finding suggests that, in dense\nenvironments, strong interactions produce an important effect in modifying\ngalaxy properties. We find that the fraction of star forming galaxies decreases\ntoward the group centre; however, galaxy pairs show a more efficient star\nformation activity than galaxies without a close companion. We have also found\nthat pair galaxies prefer groups with low density global environments with\nrespect to galaxies of the corresponding control sample. Blue, young stellar\npopulation galaxies prefer groups within low density global environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 17:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

An ongoing problem in cosmology concerns the fate of this\nenergy. In one interpretation it is irretrievably lost, i.e., energy is not\nconserved on the cosmic scale. Here we consider a different possibility which\nretains universal energy conservation. If gravitational energy is redshifted in\nthe same manner as photons, then it can be shown that the cosmic redshift\nremoves gravitational energy from space at about the same rate as photon\nenergy. Treating gravitational potential energy conventionally as negative\nenergy, it is proposed that the Hubble shift 'flips' positive energy (photons)\nto negative energy (gravitons) and vice versa. The lost photon energy would\nthus be directed towards gravitation, making gravitational energy wells more\nnegative. Conversely, within astrophysical bodies of sufficient size, the\nflipping of gravitons to photons would give rise to a 'Hubble luminosity' of\nmagnitude -UH, where U is the internal gravitational potential energy of the\nobject and H the Hubble constant. Evidence of such an energy release is\npresented in bodies ranging from planets, white dwarfs and neutron stars to\nsupermassive black holes and the visible universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 20:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-02"}

Such flows are gauged by spiral features in\nthe thermal and chemical properties of the intracluster medium, by the\nmulti-phase properties of CCs, and by X-ray edges known as cold fronts. We\nanalytically show that observations of piecewise-spiral fronts impose strong\nconstraints on the CC, implying the presence of a cold, fast flow, which\npropagates below a hot, slow inflow, separated by a slowly rotating, trailing,\nquasi spiral, tangential discontinuity surface. This leads to the nearly\nlogarithmic spiral pattern, two-phase plasma, \\rho \\sim r^{-1} density (or T\n\\sim r^{0.4} temperature) radial profile, and ~100kpc size, characteristic of\nCCs. By advecting heat and mixing the gas, such flows can eliminate the cooling\nproblem, provided that a feedback mechanism regulates the flow. In particular,\nwe present a quasi-steady-state model for an accretion-quenched, composite\nflow, in which the fast phase is an outflow, regulated by active galactic\nnucleus bubbles, reproducing the observed low star formation rates and\nexplaining some features of bubbles such as their R_b \\propto r size.

(2011). We confirm six Lyman Alpha emitters (LAEs), three of which have\nsignificant asymmetric line profiles with prominent wings extending 300-400\nkm/s redward of the peak emission. With these six LAEs, we revise our previous\nestimate of the number of faint LAEs in the Dressler et al. survey. Combining\nthese data with the density of bright LAEs in the Cosmic Origins Survey and\nSubaru Deep Field provides the best constraints to date on the redshift 5.7 LAE\nluminosity function (LF). Schechter function parameters, phi^* = 4.5 x 10^{-4}\nMpc^{-3}, L^* = 9.1 x 10^{42} erg s^{-1}, and alpha= -1.70, are estimated using\na maximum likelihood technique with a model for slit losses. To place this\nresult in the context of the UV-selected galaxy population, we investigate how\nvarious parameterizations of the Lyman Alpha equivalent width distribution,\nalong with the measured UV-continuum LF, affect shape and normalization of the\nLyman Alpha LF. The nominal model, which uses z~6 equivalent widths from the\nliterature, falls short of the observed space density of LAEs at the bright\nend, possibly indicating a need for higher equivalent widths. This\nparameterization of the equivalent width distribution implies that as many as\n50% of our faintest LAEs should have M_{UV} > -18.0, rendering them\nundetectable in even the deepest Hubble Space Telescope surveys at this\nredshift. Hence, ultra-deep emission-line surveys find some of the faintest\ngalaxies ever observed at the end of the reionization epoch. Such faint\ngalaxies likely enrich the intergalactic medium with metals and maintain its\nionized state. Observations of these objects provide a glimpse of the building\nblocks of present-day galaxies at an early time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 21:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The X-ray emission can be modeled by either a single thermal\ncomponent with a temperature of ~ 1.5 keV, or with two thermal components with\ntemperatures of 1.5 and 0.2 keV. Previous studies suggest that the hot\ncomponent may originate from reverse-shocked SN ejecta.

The X-ray\nand IR emission in the shell are spatially correlated, suggesting that the dust\nparticles are collisionally heated by the X-ray emitting gas. The IR spectrum\nof the shell is dominated by continuum emission from dust with little, or no\nline emission. Modeling the IR spectrum shows that the dust is heated to a\ntemperature of ~ 140 K by a relatively dense, hot plasma, that also gives rise\nto the hot X-ray emission component. The density inferred from the IR emission\nis significantly higher than the density inferred from the X-ray models,\nsuggesting a low filling factor for this X-ray emitting gas.

Gamma radiation indicated most\ndrastic change, i.e., peak value (9.3 times usual level) appeared on March 16,\nand decreased to 1.7 times usual level after two months.

Regarding (a), we identify ten complex\nsystems likely to have undergone multiple merger events in the recent past.\nRegarding (b), we identify eleven systems likely to be post-collision, binary,\nhead-on mergers (BHOMs), as well as another six mergers that are possible BHOMs\nbut probably harder to interpret because of non-negligible impact parameters\nand merger axes closer to our line of sight. Regarding (c), we find a highly\nsignificant increase with redshift in the fraction of morphologically disturbed\nclusters starting at z \\sim 0.4, in spite of a detection bias in our sample\nagainst very disturbed systems at high redshift. A larger sample of clusters\nwith high-quality X-ray data in particular at high redshift will be needed to\ntrace the evolutionary history of cluster growth and relaxation closer to the\nprimary epoch of cluster formation z \\sim 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 05:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We assign\na hard-core volume only to each baryon and mesons though possess a small volume\nbut they can fuse and interpenetrate into one another. Use of the full quantum\nstatistics is made in obtaining the grand canonical partition function where\nexcluded-volume correction has been incorporated by explicitly integrating over\nvolume.

This task requires the combination of both spectroscopy and\nphotometry, covering the widest possible wavelength range, to disentangle the\nvarious protostellar components and activities. As part of the POISSON project,\nwe present a multi-wavelength spectroscopic and photometric investigation of\nembedded YSOs in L1641, aimed to derive the stellar parameters and evolutionary\nstages and to infer their accretion properties. Our database includes\nlow-resolution optical-IR spectra from the NTT and Spitzer (0.6-40 um) and\nphotometric data covering a spectral range from 0.4 to 1100 um, which allow us\nto construct the YSOs spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and to infer the\nmain stellar parameters. The SED analysis allows us to group our 27 YSOs into\nnine Class I, eleven Flat, and seven Class II objects. However, on the basis of\nthe derived stellar properties, only six Class I YSOs have an age of ~10^5 yr,\nwhile the others are older 5x10^5-10^6 yr), and, among the Flat sources, three\nout of eleven are more evolved objects (5x10^6-10^7 yr), indicating that\ngeometrical effects can significantly modify the SED shapes. Inferred mass\naccretion rates (Macc) show a wide range of values (3.6x10^-9 to 1.2x10^-5\nM_sun yr^-1), which reflects the age spread observed in our sample. Average\nvalues of mass accretion rates, extinction, and spectral indices decrease with\nthe YSO class. The youngest YSOs have the highest Macc, whereas the oldest YSOs\ndo not show any detectable jet activity in either images and spectra. We also\nobserve a clear correlation among the YSO Macc, M*, and age, consistent with\nmass accretion evolution in viscous disc models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 12:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-11"}

Based on a power-law ansatz for the\nsurface density, $\\Sigma(r) \\propto r^{-p}$, a parameter study of star-disc\nencounters with different initial disc-mass distributions has been performed\nusing N-body simulations. It is demonstrated that the shape of the disc-mass\ndistribution has a significant impact on the quantity of the disc-mass and\nangular momentum losses in star-disc encounters.

Classical Be stars are hot non-supergiant stars surrounded by a\ngaseous circumstellar disk that is responsible for the observed infrared-excess\nand emission lines. The phenomena involved in the disk formation still remain\nhighly debated. Aims. To progress in the understanding of the physical process\nor processes responsible for the mass ejections and test the hypothesis that\nthey depend on the stellar parameters, we initiated a survey on the\ncircumstellar environment of the brightest Be stars. Methods. To achieve this\ngoal, we used spectro-interferometry, the only technique that combines high\nspectral (R=12000) and high spatial ($\\theta_{\\rm min}$=4\\,mas) resolutions.\nObservations were carried out at the Paranal observatory with the VLTI/AMBER\ninstrument.

The amplitude of the seismic QBO is modulated by the 11-yr solar cycle,\nwith the amplitude of the signal being largest at solar maximum. The amplitude\nof the signal is noticeably larger for the l=2 and 3 modes than for the l=0 and\n1 modes. The seismic QBO shows some frequency dependence but this dependence is\nnot as strong as observed in the 11-yr solar cycle. These results are\nconsistent with the seismic QBO having its origins in shallow layers of the\ninterior (one possibility being the bottom of the shear layer extending 5per\ncent below the solar surface). Under this scenario the magnetic flux\nresponsible for the seismic QBO is brought to the surface (where its influence\non the p modes is stronger) by buoyant flux from the 11-yr cycle, the strong\ncomponent of which is observed at predominantly low-latitudes. As the l=2 and 3\nmodes are much more sensitive to equatorial latitudes than the l=0 and 1 modes\nthe influence of the 11-yr cycle on the seismic QBO is more visible in l=2 and\n3 mode frequencies.

To isolate the\nlatitudinal dependence of the seismic QBO from the 11-yr solar cycle we must\nconsider epochs when the 11-yr solar cycle is weak.

This scheme builds on compress-forward\n(CF) relaying but involves three new ideas, namely no Wyner-Ziv binning,\nrelaxed simultaneous decoding and message repetition. In this paper, using the\ntwo-way relay channel as the underlining example, we analyze the impact of each\nof these ideas on the achievable rate region of relay networks. First, CF\nwithout binning but with joint decoding of both the message and compression\nindex can achieve a larger rate region than the original CF scheme for\nmulti-destination relay networks. With binning and successive decoding, the\ncompression rate at each relay is constrained by the weakest link from the\nrelay to a destination; but without binning, this constraint is relaxed.\nSecond, simultaneous decoding of all messages over all blocks without uniquely\ndecoding the compression indices can remove the constraints on compression rate\ncompletely, but is still subject to the message block boundary effect. Third,\nmessage repetition is necessary to overcome this boundary effect and achieve\nthe noisy network coding region for multi-source networks. The rate region is\nenlarged with increasing repetition times. We also apply CF without binning\nspecifically to the one-way and two-way relay channels and analyze the rate\nregions in detail. For the one-way relay channel, it achieves the same rate as\nthe original CF and noisy network coding but has only 1 block decoding delay.\nFor the two-way relay channel, we derive the explicit channel conditions in the\nGaussian and fading cases for CF without binning to achieve the same rate\nregion or sum rate as noisy network coding. These analyses may be appealing to\npractical implementation because of the shorter encoding and decoding delay in\nCF without binning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 04:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-14"}

In this paper, we extend on previous work and\npropose the 3D-ASAP algorithm, for the graph realization problem in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$, given a sparse and noisy set of distance measurements. 3D-ASAP\nis a divide and conquer, non-incremental and non-iterative algorithm, which\nintegrates local distance information into a global structure determination.\nOur approach starts with identifying, for every node, a subgraph of its 1-hop\nneighborhood graph, which can be accurately embedded in its own coordinate\nsystem. In the noise-free case, the computed coordinates of the sensors in each\npatch must agree with their global positioning up to some unknown rigid motion,\nthat is, up to translation, rotation and possibly reflection. In other words,\nto every patch there corresponds an element of the Euclidean group Euc(3) of\nrigid transformations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and the goal is to estimate the group\nelements that will properly align all the patches in a globally consistent way.\nFurthermore, 3D-ASAP successfully incorporates information specific to the\nmolecule problem in structural biology, in particular information on known\nsubstructures and their orientation. In addition, we also propose 3D-SP-ASAP, a\nfaster version of 3D-ASAP, which uses a spectral partitioning algorithm as a\npreprocessing step for dividing the initial graph into smaller subgraphs. Our\nextensive numerical simulations show that 3D-ASAP and 3D-SP-ASAP are very\nrobust to high levels of noise in the measured distances and to sparse\nconnectivity in the measurement graph, and compare favorably to similar\nstate-of-the art localization algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 17:38:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 01:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 02:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}
