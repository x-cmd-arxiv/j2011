Today's smartphones are equipped\nwith increasingly more sensors and accessible data types that enable the\ncollection of literally dozens of signals related to the phone, its user, and\nits environment. A great deal of research effort in academia and industry is\nput into mining this raw data for higher level sense-making, such as\nunderstanding user context, inferring social networks, learning individual\nfeatures, predicting outcomes, and so on. In this work we investigate the\nproperties of learning and inference of real world data collected via mobile\nphones over time. In particular, we look at the dynamic learning process over\ntime, and how the ability to predict individual parameters and social links is\nincrementally enhanced with the accumulation of additional data. To do this, we\nuse the Friends and Family dataset, which contains rich data signals gathered\nfrom the smartphones of 140 adult members of a young-family residential\ncommunity for over a year, and is one of the most comprehensive mobile phone\ndatasets gathered in academia to date. We develop several models that predict\nsocial and individual properties from sensed mobile phone data, including\ndetection of life-partners, ethnicity, and whether a person is a student or\nnot. Then, for this set of diverse learning tasks, we investigate how the\nprediction accuracy evolves over time, as new data is collected. Finally, based\non gained insights, we propose a method for advance prediction of the maximal\nlearning accuracy possible for the learning task at hand, based on an initial\nset of measurements. This has practical implications, like informing the design\nof mobile data collection campaigns, or evaluating analysis strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2011 16:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-22"}

The real part on its own gives a lower bound to the absolute\nmagnitude of the amplitude which is in itself an important constraint for\ndetermining gamma.

Direct four-point function\ncalculations on the lattice, while computationally demanding, does yield the\nreal part as that is not impeded by the Maiani-Testa theorem.

We have obtained\ndiffraction limited imaging and grism spectroscopy of IRC +10216 at the 6.5m\nMMT in the N-band (~8-13 microns). These new observations show that a change\nhas occurred in the dust shell surrounding IRC +10216 over the last two\ndecades, which is illustrated by a change in the apparent shape of the well\nknown SiC spectral feature at ~11 microns and a reduction in the continuum at\n13 microns. As expected, our diffraction limited spatial information shows an\nextended circumstellar envelope. We also demonstrate that the dusty envelope\nappears to be ~30% larger at the wavelengths of the SiC feature, likely due to\nthe increased opacity of SiC. The deconvolved FWHM of the object increases from\n0.43\" (~56 AU) for wavelength < 10 microns to 0.58\" (~75 AU) at 11.8 microns,\nthen decreases to 0.5\" (~65 AU) at 12.7 microns.

Our results\nsuggest that it may be possible to improve the efficiency of the production of\ncold molecules in buffer-gas cooling experiments by increasing the density of\nhelium. In addition, we find that the shape of molecules is important for the\ncollision dynamics when the vibrational motion of molecules is frozen. For some\nmolecules, it is even more crucial than the number of accessible degrees of\nfreedom. This indicates that by selecting molecules with suitable shape for\nbuffer-gas cooling, it may be possible to cool molecules with a very large\nnumber of degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 00:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The model combines the harmonic network of residue beads with\noverdamped dynamics of the normal modes of the network characterized by two\nfriction coefficients. The electrostatic component is introduced to the model\nthrough atomic charges of the protein force field. The overall effect of the\nelectrostatic fluctuations of the network is recorded through the\nfrequency-dependent response functions of the electrostatic potential and\nelectric field at the active site. We also consider the dynamics of\ndisplacements of individual residues in the network and the dynamics of\ndistances between pairs of residues. The model is tested against loss spectra\nof residue displacements and the electrostatic potential and electric field at\nthe heme's iron from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of three hydrated\nglobular proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 04:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The\nclassical mean-field theory of van der Waals is applied to predict the\ndependence of hysteresis on temperature and pore size, using the regular\nsolution model and gradient energy of Cahn and Hilliard. A simple \"hierarchical\nwetting\" model for thin nanopores is developed to describe the case of strong\nwetting by the first monolayer, followed by condensation of nanodroplets and\nnanobubbles in the bulk. The model predicts a larger hysteresis critical\ntemperature and enhanced hysteresis for molecular condensation across nanopores\nat high vapor pressure than within monolayers at low vapor pressure. For\nheterogeneous pores, the theory predicts sorption/desorption sequences similar\nto those seen in molecular dynamics simulations, where the interfacial energy\n(or gradient penalty) at nanopore junctions acts as a free energy barrier for\nsnap-through instabilities. The model helps to quantitatively understand recent\nexperimental data for concrete or cement paste wetting and drying cycles and\nsuggests new experiments at different temperatures and humidity sweep rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 05:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We have synthesized\nRuSr2Gd1.4Ce0.6Cu2O10-{\\delta} (GdRu-1222) magneto-superconductor through\nstandard solid state reaction route and measured its magnetic, transport and\nthermal properties. We also synthesized RuSr2Eu1.4Ce0.6Cu2O10-{\\delta}\n(EuRu-1222) then measured its heat capacity in zero magnetic fields for\nreference. The studied compounds crystallized in tetragonal structure with\nspace group I4/mmm. GdRu-1222 is a reported magneto-superconductor with Ru\nspins magnetic ordering at temperature around 110 K and superconductivity in\nCu-O2 planes below around 40 K. To explore the crossing point phenomena, the\nspecific heat [Cp (T)] was investigated in temperature range 1.9-250 K, under\nmagnetic field of up to 70 kOe. Unfortunately though no magnetic and\nsuperconducting transitions are observed in specific heat, a Schottky type\nanomaly is observed at low temperatures below 20 K. This low temperature\nSchottky type anomaly can be attributed to splitting of the ground state\nspectroscopic term 8S7/2 of paramagnetic Gd3+ ions by both internal and\nexternal magnetic fields. It was also observed that Cp (T) being measured for\ndifferent values of magnetic field, possesses the same crossing point (T* = 2.7\nK), up to the applied magnetic field 70 kOe. A quantitative explanation of this\nphenomenon, based on its shape and temperature dependence of the associated\ngeneralized heat capacity (Cp), is presented. This effect supports the crossing\npoint phenomena, which is supposed to be inherent for strongly correlated\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 05:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 07:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In addition, we\ndemonstrate that the present method also provides an ellipsoidal volume\nestimate of the viable part of parameter space and is able to estimate the\nphysical volume of the compartment in which the observed reactions take place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 08:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-22"}

However, solar activity time series are non-stationary due\nto the almost periodic 11 year smooth component, and the analysis does not give\nthe correct $H$ for the stochastic component. Better estimates are obtained by\ndetrended fluctuations analysis (DFA), but estimates are biased and errors are\nlarge due to the short time records. These time series can be modeled as a\nstochastic process of the form $x(t)=y(t)+\\sigma \\sqrt{y(t)}\\, w_H(t)$, where\n$y(t)$ is the smooth component, and $w_H(t) $ is a stationary fractional noise\nwith Hurst exponent $H$.

An important feature, observed on both laboratory and geophysical\nscale, is that the MHz radiation systematically precedes the kHz one. Yet, the\nlink between an individual EM precursor and a distinctive stage of the EQ\npreparation comprises a crucial open question. A recently proposed two-stage\nmodel on preseismic EM activity suggests that the MHz EM emission is due to the\nfracture of the highly heterogeneous system that surrounds the fault. The\nfinally emerged kHz EM emission is rooted in the final stage of EQ generation,\nnamely, the fracture of entities sustaining the system. In this work we try to\nfurther penetrate and elucidate the link of the precursory kHz EM activity with\nthe last stage of EQ generation building on two theoretical models for EQ\ndynamics. Firstly, the self-affine model states that an EQ is due to the\nslipping of two rough and rigid fractional Brownian profiles, one over the\nother, when there is an intersection between them. Secondly, the\nfragment-asperity model, rooted in a nonextensive Tsallis framework starting\nfrom first principles, consists of two rough profiles interacting via fragments\nfilling the gap. In the latter approach, the mechanism of triggering EQ is\nestablished through the interaction of the irregularities of the fault planes\nand the fragments between them. This paper shows that these models of EQ\ndynamics can be linked with the detected kHz EM emission. In this framework of\nanalysis of preseismic EM activity, we identify sufficient criteria that offer\nthe possibility to discriminate whether a seismic shock is sourced in the\nfracture of fragments filling the gap between the rough profiles or in the\nfracture of \"teeth\" distributed across the fractional Brownian profiles that\nsustain the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 11:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 10:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-30"}

We measure column densities in nine low-ionization systems at 4.7 < z <\n6.3 using Keck, Magellan, and VLT optical and near-infrared spectra with\nmoderate to high resolution. The column density ratios among C II, O I, Si II,\nand Fe II are nearly identical to sub-DLAs and metal-poor ([M/H] < -1) DLAs at\nlower redshifts, with no significant evolution over 2 < z < 6. The estimated\nintrinsic scatter in the ratio of any two elements is also small, with a\ntypical r.m.s. deviation of <0.1 dex. These facts suggest that dust depletion\nand ionization effects are minimal in our z > 4.7 systems, as in the\nlower-redshift DLAs, and that the column density ratios are close to the\nintrinsic relative element abundances. The abundances in our z > 4.7 systems\nare therefore likely to represent the typical integrated yields from stellar\npopulations within the first gigayear of cosmic history. Due to the time limit\nimposed by the age of the universe at these redshifts, our measurements thus\nplace direct constraints on the metal production of massive stars, including\niron yields of prompt supernovae. The lack of redshift evolution further\nsuggests that the metal inventories of most metal-poor absorption systems at z\n> 2 are also dominated by massive stars, with minimal contributions from\ndelayed Type Ia supernovae or AGB winds. The relative abundances in our systems\nbroadly agree with those in very metal-poor, non-carbon-enhanced Galactic halo\nstars. This is consistent with the picture in which present-day metal-poor\nstars were potentially formed as early as one billion years after the Big Bang.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 12:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Theoretical calculations have shown that when solar prominences move\naway from the surface of the Sun, their radiative output is affected via the\nDoppler dimming or brightening effects. Aims. In this paper we ask whether\nobservational signatures of the changes in the radiative output of eruptive\nprominences can be found in EUV (extreme ultraviolet) observations of the first\nresonance line of ionised helium at 304 {\\AA}. We also investigate whether\nthese observations can be used to perform a diagnostic of the plasma of the\neruptive prominence. Methods. We first look for suitable events in the SDO/AIA\ndatabase. The variation of intensity of arbitrarily selected features in the\n304 channel is studied as a function of velocity in the plane of the sky. These\nresults are then compared with new non-LTE radiative transfer calculations of\nthe intensity of the He II 304 resonance line. Results. We find that\nobservations of intensities in various parts of the four eruptive prominences\nstudied here are sometimes consistent with the Doppler dimming effect on the He\nII 304 {\\AA} line. However, in some cases, one observes an increase in\nintensity in the 304 channel with velocity, in contradiction to what is\nexpected from the Doppler dimming effect alone. The use of the non-LTE models\nallows us to explain the different behaviour of the intensity by changes in the\nplasma parameters inside the prominence, in particular the column mass of the\nplasma and its temperature. Conclusions. The non-LTE models used here are more\nrealistic than what was used in previous calculations. They are able to\nreproduce qualitatively the range of observations from SDO/AIA analysed in this\nstudy. Thanks to non-LTE modelling, we can infer the plasma parameters in\neruptive prominences from SDO/AIA observations at 304 {\\AA}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 12:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-17"}

The study\ncombines the vacuum polarization energy of fermion zero-point fluctuations and\nthe binding energy of occupied energy levels, which are of the same order in a\nsemi-classical expansion. Populating these bound states assigns a charge to the\nstring. Strings carrying fermion charge become stable if the Higgs and gauge\nfields are coupled to a fermion that is less than twice as heavy as the top\nquark. The vacuum remains stable in the model, because neutral strings are not\nenergetically favored. These findings suggest that extraordinarily large\nfermion masses or unrealistic couplings are not required to bind a cosmic\nstring in the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 13:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-18"}

The major flare from December 1993\nshows spectral evidence of three such self-absorbed components. The analysis\nyields an estimate of the power that is required to eject the plasmoids from\nthe central engine that is independent of other estimates that exist in the\nliterature for different flares. The technique has an advantage since the\nabsorbed spectrum contains an independent constraint provided by the optical\ndepth at each epoch of observation. The modeling procedure presented here\nself-consistently determines the dimensions of the radio emitting plasma from\nthe spectral shape. Thus, structural dimensions are determined analytically\nthat can be much smaller than interferometer beam-widths. A synthesis of the\ntime evolution of the components allows one to address the fundamental\nuncertainties in previous estimates. First, the plasma is not protonic, but it\nis comprised of an electron-positron gas. The minimum electron energy is\ndetermined to be less than six times the electron rest mass energy. The\nanalysis also indicates that the plasmoids are ejected from the central engine\nmagnetically dominated. The temporal behavior is one of magnetic energy\nconversion to mechanical energy as the plasmoids approach equipartition.

For the preconditioned HLL scheme, the global cut-off problem is\nattributable to the denominator of the coefficients, whereas the particular\npressure gradient sensor problem results from the loss of the capability to\nsuppress the checkerboard pressure-velocity decoupling. A new all-speed HLL\nscheme, which can overcome these problems by only multiplying the\nmomentum-derivative term in the momentum equation by a function related to the\nlocal Mach number, is proposed. More importantly, the present study shows the\ngenerality of the three rules, which can be powerful tools for analyzing and\nproposing schemes. The second rule involving the checkerboard problem is also\nimproved by emphasizing that the coefficients of pressure-derivative term in\nthe continuity and energy equations should be changed simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 14:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

In this paper we report a study simulating the strategy used by humans\nto recognize the centers of a network.

The simulation thus performed leads to a novel way of path-finding\nin a network.

At this X-ray energy no bulk\ndamage in silicon is expected. However fixed oxide charges in the SiO2 layer\nand interface traps at the Si-SiO2 interface will build up. As function of the\n12 keV X-ray dose the microscopic defects in test structures and the macro-\nscopic electrical properties of segmented sensors have been investigated. From\nthe test structures the oxide charge density, the density of interface traps\nand their properties as function of dose have been determined.

For segmented\nsensors surface damage introduced by the X-rays increases the full depletion\nvoltage, the surface leakage current and the inter-pixel capacitance. In\naddition an electron accumulation layer forms at the Si-SiO2 interface which\nincreases with dose and decreases with applied voltage. Using TCAD simulations\nwith the dose dependent damage parameters obtained from the test struc- tures\nthe results of the measurements can be reproduced.

The magnetic structures are identify and\nclassified according to the area of the solar disk covered. We constrained the\nmodel by comparing the output of the model and observations of the solar\nirradiance made by instruments onboard of SORCE spacecraft. Here we focus on\ntwo regions of the spectra that are covered by SORCE instruments. The\ngeneralization of the network is tested by dividing the data sets on two\ngroups: the training set; and, the validation set. We have found that the model\nerror is wavelength dependent. While the model error for 24-hour forecast in\nthe band from 115 to 180 nm is lower than 5%, the model error can reach 20% in\nthe band from 180 to 310 nm. The performance of the network reduces\nprogressively with the increase of the forecast period, which limits\nsignificantly the maximum forecast period that we can achieve with the\ndiscussed architecture. The model proposed allows us to predict the total and\nspectral solar irradiance up to three days in advance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 09:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

In 3-dimensional space, this leads to a variation in\nPlanck constant \\hbar and speed of light c. They vary as \\hbar ~ a^(1/2) and c\n~ a^(-1/2), a is the local scale. A direct consequence is that the expanding\nuniverse progressively alters the values of c which in turn affects the\nevolution of the universe itself. Friedmann eqns violate scale invariance and\nneglect to account for the scale dependency of c. We build a cosmological model\nwhich is fully consistent with scale invariance and respects Lorentz\ninvariance. This model leads to a universe different from the ones depicted in\nFriedmann model. We apply our model to resolve a series of observational and\ntheoretical difficulties in modern cosmology: \"runaway density parameter\"\nproblem, budgetary shortfall, horizon problem, eg. Our model does not resort to\ninflation hypothesis. We derive a modification to the Hubble law and Hubble\nconstant, and a new brightness-redshift relationship for Type Ia supernovae:\n(a) Hubble constant has been inadvertently overestimated by a factor of 9/5; so\nhas the critical density by (9/5)^2; (b) Our new photometric distance-redshift\nrelationship d_L=2c/(3H0)*(1+z)^(5/6)\\ln(1+z) with one parameter H0=37 fits to\nthe high-$z$ objects as equally well as the traditional relationship does with\nthree parameters H0=70.5, OmegaM=0.27, OmegaL=0.73. We draw two conclusions:\n(i) With H0=37, the critical density is only 0.28 time the value previously\nthought; dark energy is absent. (ii) H0=37 restores the age estimate to 17.6 Gy\n(via t_0=2/(3H0)). They also raise the possibility that the universe expansion\nis not accelerating, but rather a result of c progressively adapting to new\nspatial scale as the universe expands. Finally, we discuss an array of\nimplications of scale invariance in the larger context of physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2011 21:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 01:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-28"}
