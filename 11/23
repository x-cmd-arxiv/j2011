First we employ Atiyah and Manton's early observation\nto show that the instanton approximation gives the correct infrared behavior\nfor the Skyrmion solution, and thus those of the electromagnetic form factors\nof the nucleon. We then use Skyrmions generated from flat-space instanton\nsolutions to study various baryon properties, treating the instanton size as an\narbitrary variable. It is found that, a large instanton size is required to\nreproduce the physical axial coupling. From such an instanton configuration,\nthe predictions for other baryon quantities in the Skyrme model improve the\noriginal results quite a lot. Some of the results reproduce those by quantizing\nthe full instanton solution, while no fine-tuning of the mesonic parameters are\nneeded. From these we conclude that the baryons in the low energy region can be\neffectively described by large instantons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 16:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

We complete the multiwavelength study with IRAM 30m\nHERA CO(2-1) and VLA 6 cm radio continuum observations of NGC 4330. The data\nare interpreted with the help of a dynamical model including ram pressure and,\nfor the first time, star formation. Our best-fit model reproduces qualitatively\nthe observed projected position, radial velocity of the galaxy, the molecular\nand atomic gas distribution and velocity field, and the UV distribution in the\nregion where a gas tail is present. However, the observed red UV color on the\nwindward side is currently not reproduced by the model. Based on our model, the\ngalaxy moves to the north and still approaches the cluster center with the\nclosest approach occurring in ~100 Myr. In contrast to other Virgo spiral\ngalaxies affected by ram pressure stripping, NGC 4330 does not show an\nasymmetric ridge of polarized radio continuum emission. We suggest that this is\ndue to the relatively slow compression of the ISM and the particular projection\nof NGC 4330. The observed offset between the HI and UV tails is well reproduced\nby our model. Since collapsing and starforming gas clouds decouple from the ram\npressure wind, the UV-emitting young stars have the angular momentum of the gas\nat the time of their creation. On the other hand, the gas is constantly pushed\nby ram pressure. The reaction (phase change, star formation) of the multiphase\nISM (molecular, atomic, ionized) to ram pressure is discussed in the framework\nof our dynamical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 16:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This thesis presents feasibility studies of the\nmeasurement of eta meson decay using WASA-at-COSY detector which tests\npredictions of the Standard Model. The aim of this thesis is to estimate the\ntime of measurement for which the current branching ratio limit of eta -> 4pi0\ndecay can be improved. In order to estimate the time of measurement Monte Carlo\nsimulations were performed. Kinematics of the pp -> ppeta -> pp4pi0 -> pp8gamma\nreactions were simulated using PLUTO program. Next, by means of the GEANT3\nprogram the response of the WASA-at-COSY detector was simulated for each\nparticle. Received signals were analysed in RootSorter software package based\non ROOT. Studies of the reaction with many gamma quanta in the exit channel\nrequired the investigation of WASA-at-COSY calorimeter functioning. Tests of a\ncluster building algorithm with emphasis on merging and splitting of detected\nsignals were done. The obtained result shows that only about 3% of eta -> 4p0\ndecays can be properly reconstructed. The identification of the eta -> 4pi0 ->\n8gamma decay was based on the invariant mass method for both pi0 and eta\nmesons. As a result, the resolution of the invariant mass determination of the\neta meson was established to sigma = 31 MeV/c2. The acceptance of the\nWASA-at-COSY detector for pp -> ppeta -> pp4pi0 -> pp8gamma reaction was\ndetermined to Aeta=(Neta detected) / (Neta produced) = 1.5%. The time of\nmeasurement for obtaining a statistical precision equal to the current\nbranching ratio limit for Tbeam = 1.3 GeV is about 13 hours. It was also\nestablished that the lower the excess energy in the eta production is the\nshorter the time of the measurement needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 16:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

We observe a weak correlation between z\nand alpha which remains even when Malmquist bias is removed. The strength of\nthis correlation depends on both the k-correction and sample selection\nfrequency, in addition to the frequency at which alpha is measured, and\nconsistent results for both high and low frequency selected samples are only\nseen if analysis is restricted to just extended radio galaxies. Many of the\nhighest redshift radio galaxies are very compact and often display a negatively\ncurved or peaked spectrum, and therefore the low-frequency radio spectrum as a\nwhole should be studied; this is something for which the LOFAR will be crucial.\nWe quantify both the efficiency and the completeness of various techniques used\nto select high-z radio galaxies. A steep-spectrum cut applied to low-frequency\nselected samples can more than double the fraction of high-z sources, but at a\ncost of excluding over half of the high-z sources present in the original\nsample. An angular size cut is an almost as equally effective method as a\nsteep-spectrum cut, and works for both high and low frequency selected samples.\nIn multi-wavelength data, selection first of infrared-faint radio sources\nremains by far the most efficient method of selecting high-z sources.

Unlike\nmethods that were used previously, our technique addresses the question whether\none or more 'testing coefficients' (e.g. in the phase) parameterizing\ndeviations from GR are non-zero, rather than all of them differing from zero at\nthe same time. The framework is well-adapted to a scenario where most sources\nhave low signal-to-noise ratio, and information from multiple sources as seen\nin multiple detectors can readily be combined. In our previous work, we\nconjectured that this framework can detect generic deviations from GR that can\nin principle not be accomodated by our model waveforms, on condition that the\nchange in phase near frequencies where the detectors are the most sensitive is\ncomparable to that induced by simple shifts in the lower-order phase\ncoefficients of more than a few percent ($\\sim 5$ radians at 150 Hz). To\nfurther support this claim, we perform additional numerical experiments in\nGaussian and stationary noise according to the expected Advanced LIGO/Virgo\nnoise curves, and coherently injecting signals into the network whose phasing\ndiffers structurally from the predictions of GR, but with the magnitude of the\ndeviation still being small.

A resummation of all unpaired fermion degrees of freedom inside the\nbag is sufficient to solve the fermion sign problem in a variety of interesting\ncases. Using a concept of duality we then argue that the size of the fermion\nbags is small both at strong and weak couplings. This allows us to construct\nefficient algorithms in both these limits. Using the fermion bag approach, we\nstudy the quantum phase transition of the 3D massless lattice Thirrring model\nwhich is of interest in the context of Graphene.

We explain the\nprocess of analogy creation, draw connections at several levels of hierarchy\nand identify similar patterns that govern the structure of the hierarchical\nsystems silk and music and discuss the impact of the derived analogy for\nnanotechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 19:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

Rather than a fundamental\nthermodynamic limit, this bound can be traced to the difficulty of maintaining\nthermoelectric compatibility. Self-compatibility locally maximizes the cooler's\ncoefficient of performance for a given zT and can be achieved by adjusting the\nrelative ratio of the thermoelectric transport properties that make up zT. In\nthis study, we investigate the theoretical performance of thermoelectric\ncoolers that maintain self-compatibility across the device. We find such a\ndevice behaves very differently from a Peltier cooler, and term self-compatible\ncoolers \"Thomson coolers\" when the Fourier heat divergence is dominated by the\nThomson, as opposed to the Joule, term. A Thomson cooler requires an\nexponentially rising Seebeck coefficient with increasing temperature, while\ntraditional Peltier coolers, such as those used commercially, have\ncomparatively minimal change in Seebeck coefficient with temperature. When\nreasonable material property bounds are placed on the thermoelectric leg, the\nThomson cooler is predicted to achieve approximately twice the maximum\ntemperature drop of a traditional Peltier cooler with equivalent figure of\nmerit (zT). We anticipate the development of Thomson coolers will ultimately\nlead to solid state cooling to cryogenic temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 19:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 15:24:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 04:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

BEAMS is a Bayesian\nframework for using data from multiple species in statistical inference when\none has the probability that each data point belongs to a given species,\ncorresponding in this context to different types of supernovae with their\nprobabilities derived from their multi-band lightcurves. We run the BEAMS\nalgorithm on both Gaussian and more realistic SNANA simulations with of order\n10^4 supernovae, testing the algorithm against various pitfalls one might\nexpect in the new and somewhat uncharted territory of photometric supernova\ncosmology.

We then apply BEAMS to the 792 SDSS-II photometric supernovae\nwith host spectroscopic redshifts.

M 87\nhas been established as a VHE gamma-ray emitter since 2006. The VHE gamma-ray\nemission displays strong variability on timescales as short as a day. In this\npaper, results from a joint VHE monitoring campaign on M 87 by the MAGIC and\nVERITAS instruments in 2010 are reported. During the campaign, a flare at VHE\nwas detected triggering further observations at VHE (H.E.S.S.), X-rays\n(Chandra), and radio (43 GHz VLBA). The excellent sampling of the VHE gamma-ray\nlight curve enables one to derive a precise temporal characterization of the\nflare: the single, isolated flare is well described by a two-sided exponential\nfunction with significantly different flux rise and decay times. While the\noverall variability pattern of the 2010 flare appears somewhat different from\nthat of previous VHE flares in 2005 and 2008, they share very similar\ntimescales (~day), peak fluxes (Phi(>0.35 TeV) ~= (1-3) x 10^-11 ph cm^-2\ns^-1), and VHE spectra. 43 GHz VLBA radio observations of the inner jet regions\nindicate no enhanced flux in 2010 in contrast to observations in 2008, where an\nincrease of the radio flux of the innermost core regions coincided with a VHE\nflare. On the other hand, Chandra X-ray observations taken ~3 days after the\npeak of the VHE gamma-ray emission reveal an enhanced flux from the core. The\nlong-term (2001-2010) multi-wavelength light curve of M 87, spanning from radio\nto VHE and including data from HST, LT, VLA and EVN, is used to further\ninvestigate the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission. No unique, common MWL\nsignature of the three VHE flares has been identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 21:26:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 08:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

The length-distribution of\nthese SAWs encompasses to distinct averages, viz. the averages over cluster-\nand SAW-conformations. For the latter average, there are two basic options, one\nbeing static and one being kinetic. It is well known for static averaging that\nif the disorder of the underlying medium is weak, differences to the ordered\ncase appear merely in non-universal quantities. Using dynamical field theory,\nwe show that the same holds true for kinetic averaging. For strong disorder,\ni.e., the medium being close to the percolation point, we employ a field theory\nfor the nonlinear random resistor network in conjunction with a real-world\ninterpretation of Feynman diagrams, and we calculate the scaling exponents for\nthe shortest, the longest and the mean or average SAW to 2-loop order. In\naddition, we calculate to 2-loop order the entire family of multifractal\nexponents that governs the moments of the the statistical weights of the\nelementary constituents (bonds or sites of the underlying fractal cluster)\ncontributing to the SAWs.

Early protostellar discs are needed to drive molecular outflows and\njets observed in star forming regions, but there has been some debate to how\nthey form. From a theoretical perspective, the consequences of disc and outflow\ngeneration are crucial to understanding the very nature of how stars are\nassembled. We have performed 3D ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of\ncollapsing Bonnor-Ebert spheres, employing sink particles with a radius of 3.2\nAU alongside an AMR grid and using a cooling function to model radiative\ncooling of the gas. This has allowed us to explore 2-8x10^4 yr further into the\nevolution of an early Class 0 disc-outflow system than previous simulations.\nOur outflow is precessing, kinked, turbulent, contains internal shocks and has\na scale of 0.1 pc end-to-end. We form a rotationally dominated disc with a\nradius of 100 AU embedded inside a transient, unstable, flattened, rotating\ncore extending out to 2000 AU. The larger flattened structure launches a low\nspeed wind (v_r < 1.5 km/s) dominated by B_phi, while the inner disc launches a\ncentrifugally driven jet dominated by B_p with speeds up to 20$ km/s. From the\ninner disk, the value of dM/dt_out/dM/dt_in ~ 0.1, wheras in the outer core\ndM/dt_out/dM/dt_in ~ 1.0. The inner disc becomes unstable to a warping\ninstability due to the magnetic structure of the outflow and warps to 30 deg\nwith respect to the z-axis by the end of the simulation. The envelope is\ncleared out and is less massive than the disc. We measure star formation\nefficiencies of eta_core=0.63 (and growing), higher than theoretical\npredictions. This indicates that outflows are not as efficient at expelling\nenvelope mass as some current models estimate.

These new discoveries\nwill enable a move from single-quasar studies to investigations of statistical\nsamples, presenting new opportunities to test theoretical models for the\nstructure of quasar accretion discs and broad emission line regions (BELRs). As\none crucial step in preparing for this influx of new lensed systems, a\nlarge-scale exploration of microlensing convergence-shear parameter space is\nwarranted, requiring the computation of O(10^5) high resolution magnification\nmaps. Based on properties of known lensed quasars, and expectations from\naccretion disc/BELR modelling, we identify regions of convergence-shear\nparameter space, map sizes, smooth matter fractions, and pixel resolutions that\nshould be covered.

We introduce an efficient\nmethod that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality\nbased on shortest paths of lengths not longer than $\\ell = 1,...,L$ in case of\nnon-weighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities\nbased on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than $w_{\\ell}=\\ell\n\\Delta$, $\\ell=1,2...,L=R/\\Delta$. These measures provide a systematic\ndescription on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its\nnetwork neighborhoods 1-step out, 2-steps out, etc. up to including the whole\nnetwork. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws\nfor large non-weighted networks. As the computation of traditional centrality\nmeasures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficiently\nestimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including the\ntraditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the\nranking top-list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities\nquickly freezes as function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top-list\ncan be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largest\nnode-to-node distance for a network of $N$ nodes, exploiting the aforementioned\nscaling behavior.

The\nspace complexity of estimating the edit distance to monotonicity of a data\nstream is becoming well-understood over the past few years. Motivated by\napplications on network quality monitoring, we extend the study to estimating\nthe edit distance to monotonicity of a sliding window covering the $w$ most\nrecent items in the stream for any $w \\ge 1$. We give a deterministic algorithm\nwhich can return an estimate within a factor of $(4+\\eps)$ using\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\eps^2} \\log^2(\\eps w))$ space.\n  We also extend the study in two directions.

For many asymptotically defined properties which\nhave to hold for all or for one integer N, however, effective procedures seem\nto be difficult if not impossible to find. We review some of the main tools for\n(dis)proving decidability and apply them to problems in quantum information\ntheory. We find that questions like \"can we overcome fidelity 1/2 w.r.t. a\ntwo-qubit singlet state?\" easily become undecidable. A closer look at such\nquestions might rule out some of the \"single-letter\" formulas sought in quantum\ninformation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 08:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-24"}

Since the evolution of\nPop III stars is much faster than the Hubble rate, we consider the burst of UHE\nproton production to occur at fixed redshift (z_b=10-20). We discuss the\nformation of collisionless shocks and particle acceleration in the early\nuniverse. The composition of accelerated particles is expected to be proton\ndominated. A simple calculation is presented to illustrate the fact that the\ndiffuse neutrinos flux from the bright phase burst is concentrated in a\nrelatively narrow range around $7.5 \\times 10^{15}(20/z_b)^2$ eV. The $\\nu_\\mu$\nflux may be detectable by IceCube without violating the cascade upper limit and\nthe expected energetics of SNe associated with Pop III stars. A possible\nsignature of the neutrino production from Pop III stars may be the detection of\nresonant neutrino events. For the burst at $z_b=20$ and $\\bar{\\nu}_e$-flux at\nthe cascade upper limit, the number of resonant events in IceCube may be as\nhigh as 10 events in 5 years of observations. These events have equal energies,\n$E=6.3\\times 10^{15}$ eV, in the form of e-m cascades. Given the large\nuncertainties in the existing predictions of UHE cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, we\nargue that neutrinos from the first stars might become one of the most reliable\nhopes for UHE neutrino astronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 11:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-25"}

We address in a consistent fashion\nthe coupling between the day and the night sides of a planet by means of model\natmosphere calculations with heat redistribution. We assume that strong\nconvection leads to the same entropy on the day and night sides and that\ngravity is the same on both hemispheres.

If the\nday-night heat redistribution is very efficient or if it takes place at the\nlarge optical depth, then the day-side and the night-side cooling may be\ncomparable. However, if the day-night heat transport is not efficient or if it\ntakes place at a shallow optical depth then there can be a large difference\nbetween the day- and the night-side cooling and the night side will cool more\nefficiently. If stellar irradiation becomes stronger, e.g. owing to stellar\nevolution or migration, cooling from both the day and the night sides is\nreduced. Enhanced metallicity of the atmosphere would act as an added \"blanket\"\nand reduces both the day- and the night-side cooling. However, a stratosphere\non the planetary day side can enhance day-side cooling since its opacity acts\nas a \"sunshade\" that screens the stellar irradiation.

We use\nthe Monte Carlo radiative transfer package RADMC to construct a parametric\nmodel of the dust distribution in a flared disk with an inner cavity and\ncalculate the temperature structure consistent with the density profile, in\nthermal equilibrium with the irradiating star. For each object, we conducted a\nBayesian exploration of the parameter space generating Monte Carlo Markov\nChains (MCMC) that allow the identification of the best fit parameters and to\nconstrain their range of statistical confidence. Our calculations point to the\npresence of evacuated cavities with radii ~2-8 AU, consistent with having been\ncarved by embedded giant planets. We found parameter values consistent with\nthose previously given in the literature, indicating a mild degree of grain\ngrowth and dust settling, which deserves to be investigated with further\nmodeling and follow up observations. Resolved images with (sub)millimeter\ninterferometers are required to break some of the degeneracies of the models\nand better constrain the physical properties of these fascinating disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 14:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Virtual organizations have been\nproposed as an organizational structure adapted to collaboration among\norganizations. The concept of Virtual Organization Breeding Environment (VOBE)\nhas been proposed as a means to support the creation and operation of virtual\norganizations. With the rise of the service-oriented architecture (SOA), the\nconcept of service-oriented VOBE (SOVOBE) has been proposed as a VOBE\nsystematically organized around the concept of services. In the context of\nSOVOBEs, novel competence models supporting both service orientation and\ncollaboration among organizations have to be developed to support efficiently\npartner selection, a key aspect of VO creation. In this paper, such a\ncompetence model is presented. Our competence model consists of a competence\ndescription model, a competence verification method, and a competence search\nmethod. The competence description model is an information model to describe\norganizations, their competences, and services they provides. The competence\nverification method enables the verification of the reliance and relevance of\ncompetence descriptions. The competence search method allows a VO planner to\nselect appropriate partners based on VO specifications, encompassing competence\nrequirements.

The observed response of an OST is a complex, but\nreproducible pattern of oscillations. A small helium evaporation cryostat was\nbuilt which allows the investigation of the response of an OST in greater\ndetail. The distance between a point-like electrical heater and the OST can be\nvaried. The OST can be mounted either parallel or perpendicular to the plate,\nhousing the heat source. If the artificial quench-point releases an amount of\nenergy compatible to a real quench spot on a cavity's surface, the OST signal\nstarts with a negative pulse, which is usually strong enough to allow automatic\ndetection. Furthermore, the reflection of the Second Sound on the wall is\nobserved. A reflection coefficient R = 0.39 +- 0.05 of the glass wall is\nmeasured. This excludes a strong influence of multiple reflections in the\ncomplex OST response. Fourier analyses show three main frequencies, found in\nall OST spectra.

Furthermore, it is suggested that several\nneurobiological substrates such as cortisol (a stress hormone), NMDA and AMPA\nreceptors/subunits and intracellular calcium in the postsynaptic neurons are\ncritical factors determining parameters in Becker and Murphy's economic theory\nof addiction.

Recent studies in mainstream economics have\nmainly focused on inconsistency in intertemporal choice (dynamic\ninconsistency); while impulsivity/impatience in intertemporal choice has been\nextensively studied in behavioral economics of addiction. However, recent\nadvances in neuroeconomic and econophysical studies on intertemporal choice\nhave made it possible to study both impulsivity and inconsistency in\nintertemporal choice within a unified framework. In this paper I propose the\nnew frameworks for investigations into neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice.\nThe importance of studying neurochemical and neuroendocrinological modulations\nof intertemporal choice and time-perception (e.g. serotonin, dopamine,\ncortisol, testosterone, and epinephrine) is emphasized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 08:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

The structure of the Environmental Code\nis contrasting with the reference network of all the French Legal Codes that\npresents a rich-club of ten codes very central to the whole French legal\nsystem, but no small-world property.
