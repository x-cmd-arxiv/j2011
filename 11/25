The QNMs are damped sinusoids with characteristic\nfrequencies and decay times that depend only on the mass and spin of the black\nhole and no other parameter - a statement of the no-hair theorem. In this paper\nwe have examined the extent to which QNMs could be used to test the no-hair\ntheorem with future ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors. We\nmodel departures from general relativity (GR) by introducing extra parameters\nwhich change the mode frequencies or decay times from their general\nrelativistic values.

We construct a unique solution\nF_s to the Boltzmann equation, which is dynamically asymptotically stable with\nexponential decay rate. Moreover, if the domain is convex and the temperature\nof the wall is continuous we show that F_s is continuous away from the grazing\nset.

Within this context,\nalgorithms performing message-passing on a probabilistic graph, such as the\nsum-product (SP) and variational message passing (VMP) algorithms, have become\nincreasingly popular.\n  In this contribution, we apply a combined VMP-SP message-passing technique to\nthe design of receivers for MIMO-ODFM systems. The message-passing equations of\nthe combined scheme can be obtained from the equations of the stationary points\nof a constrained region-based free energy approximation. When applied to a\nMIMO-OFDM probabilistic model, we obtain a generic receiver architecture\nperforming iterative channel weight and noise precision estimation,\nequalization and data decoding. We show that this generic scheme can be\nparticularized to a variety of different receiver structures, ranging from\nhigh-performance iterative structures to low complexity receivers. This allows\nfor a flexible design of the signal processing specially tailored for the\nrequirements of each specific application. The numerical assessment of our\nsolutions, based on Monte Carlo simulations, corroborates the high performance\nof the proposed algorithms and their superiority to heuristic approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 20:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-28"}

At any given\ntime $t$, a SMC method produces a set of samples over the state space of the\nsystem of interest (often termed \"particles\") that is used to build a discrete\nand random approximation of the posterior probability distribution of the state\nvariables, conditional on a sequence of available observations. One potential\napplication of the methodology is the estimation of the densities associated to\nthe sequence of a posteriori distributions. While practitioners have rather\nfreely applied such density approximations in the past, the issue has received\nless attention from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of constructing kernel-based estimates of the posterior probability\ndensity function and its derivatives, and obtain asymptotic convergence results\nfor the estimation errors. In particular, we find convergence rates for the\napproximation errors that hold uniformly on the state space and guarantee that\nthe error vanishes almost surely as the number of particles in the filter\ngrows. Based on this uniform convergence result, we first show how to build\ncontinuous measures that converge almost surely (with known rate) toward the\nposterior measure and then address a few applications.

X-ray line emission, however, can also arise from\nthe charge exchange between highly ionised ions and neutral species. The\nK\\alpha\\ triplet of He-like ions can be used as a powerful diagnostic, because\nthe charge exchange X-ray emission (CXE) favours the inter-combination and\nforbidden lines, while the thermal emission favours the resonance line. We\nanalyse the OVII triplet of a sample of nine nearby star-forming galaxies\nobserved by the XMM-Newton reflection grating spectrometers. For most galaxies,\nthe forbidden lines are comparable to or stronger than the resonance lines,\nwhich is in contrast to the thermal prediction. For NGC 253, M51, M83, M61, NGC\n4631, and the Antennae galaxy, the observed line ratios are consistent with the\nratio of the CXE; for M94 and NGC 2903, the observed ratios indicate multiple\norigins; for M82, different regions show different line ratios, also indicating\nmultiple origins. We discuss other possible mechanisms that can produce a\nrelatively strong forbidden line, such as a collisional\nnon-equilibrium-ionization recombining/ionizing plasma, which are not favoured.\nThese results suggest that the CXE may be a common process and contribute a\nsignificant fraction of the soft X-ray line emission for galaxies with massive\nstar formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 08:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The latter allows\nfor the evaluation of temperatures T>0 static and dynamic quantities within\nvarious correlated models.

In particular, the\nlow-temperature Lanczos method and the microcanonical Lanczos method,\nespecially applicable within the high-T regime.

The first case is when the time\ndata is modeled as a sequence of independent and normal distributed random\nvariables with unknown, possibly changing, mean value but fixed variance. The\nmain assumption is that the mean value is piecewise constant in time, and the\ntask is to estimate the change times and the mean values within the segments.\nThe second case is when the mean value is constant, but the variance can\nchange. The assumption is that the variance is piecewise constant in time, and\nwe want to estimate change times and the variance values within the segments.\nTo find solutions to these problems, we will study an l_1 regularized maximum\nlikelihood method, related to the fused lasso method and l_1 trend filtering,\nwhere the parameters to be estimated are free to vary at each sample. To\npenalize variations in the estimated parameters, the l_1-norm of the time\ndifference of the parameters is used as a regularization term.

A Cantor Aubry-Mather set is\ncalled a minimal lamination.\n  In this paper we prove that when the rotation number of a minimal foliation\nis either rational or easy to approximate by rational numbers, then the\nfoliation can be destroyed into a lamination by an arbitrarily small smooth\nperturbation of the recurrence relation. This generalizes a theorem of Mather\nfor twist maps to general recurrence relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 12:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) typically consist of a white\ndwarf donor and a neutron star or black hole accretor. The evolution of UCXBs\nand very low mass ratio binaries in general is poorly understood. Aims. We\ninvestigate the evolution of UCXBs in order to learn for which mass ratios and\naccretor types these systems can exist, and if they do, what are their orbital\nand neutron star spin periods, mass transfer rates and evolutionary timescales.\nMethods. For different assumptions concerning accretion disk behavior we\ncalculate for which system parameters dynamical instability, thermal-viscous\ndisk instability or the propeller effect emerge. Results. At the onset of mass\ntransfer, the survival of the UCXB is determined by how efficiently the\naccretor can eject matter in the case of a super-Eddington mass transfer rate.\nAt later times, the evolution of systems strongly depends on the binary's\ncapacity to return angular momentum from the disk to the orbit. We find that\nthis feedback mechanism most likely remains effective. In the case of steady\nmass transfer, the propeller effect can stop accretion onto recycled neutron\nstars completely at a sufficiently low mass transfer rate, based on energy\nconsiderations. However, mass transfer will likely be non-steady because disk\ninstability allows for accretion of some of the transferred matter. Together,\nthe propeller effect and disk instability cause the low mass ratio UCXBs to be\nvisible a small fraction of the time at most, thereby explaining the lack of\nobservations of such systems. Conclusions. Most likely UCXBs avoid late-time\ndynamically unstable mass transfer and continue to evolve as the age of the\nUniverse allows. This implies the existence of a large population of low mass\nratio binaries with orbital periods ~ 70 - 80 min, unless some other mechanism\nhas destroyed these binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 13:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-02"}

The momentum distribution of mesons produced in a photo-nuclear\nreaction as well as the excitation function also show some sensitivity to\ndifferent in-medium modification scenarios. As an example, high statistics data\ntaken at MAMI-C on the photoproduction of \\omega\\ mesons are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 14:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

These data are used to identify the physical conditions\ngiving rise to the H2O emission and infer any dependence with velocity.

Physical and kinematical\ndifferences can be seen at the two shocked positions. At the R4 position, two\nvelocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with the\ncomponent at higher velocity (R4-HV) being less extended and less dense than\nthe low velocity component (R4-LV). H2O column densities of about 2 10^13 and 4\n10^14 cm^-2 have been derived for the R4-LV and the R4-HV components,\nrespectively.

While these coordinates were\ndesigned for studying gravitational waves, they can also be easily adapted to\nmodel cosmological past null cones (PNCs). Similar to observational coordinates\nin the observational approach to cosmology, this then provides a model that\nonly makes use of information causally connected to an observer. However, the\ndiameter distance, which is used as a radial coordinate, limits the model's\ncosmological application to the region prior to the PNC refocussing. This is\nbecause after refocussing, the diameter distance ceases to be a unique measure\nof distance. This paper addresses the problem by introducing a metric based on\nthe Bondi-Sachs metric where the radial coordinate is replaced by an affine\nparameter. A model is derived from this metric and it is then shown how an\nexisting numerical scheme can be adapted for simulation of cosmological PNC\nbehaviour. Numerical calculations on this model are found to have the same\nstability and convergence properties as the standard characteristic formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 15:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We employ the recently developed embedded Kadanoff-Baym method\n[Phys. Rev. B 80, 115107 (2009)] and show that the molecule-lead interaction\nchanges substantially the transient and steady-state transport properties. We\nfirst show that the mean-field Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation does not capture\nthe polarization effects responsible for the renormalization of the molecular\nlevels neither in nor out of equilibrium. Furthermore, due to the time-local\nnature of the HF self-energy there exists a region in parameter space for which\nthe system does not relax after the switch-on of a bias voltage. These and\nother artifacts of the HF approximation disappear when including correlations\nat the second-Born or GW levels. Both these approximations contain polarization\ndiagrams which correctly account for the screening of the charged molecule. We\nfind that by changing the molecule-lead interaction the ratio between the\nscreening and relaxation time changes, an effect which must be properly taken\ninto account in any realistic time-dependent simulation. Another important\nfinding is that while in equilibrium the molecule-lead interaction is\nresponsible for a reduction of the HOMO-LUMO gap and for a substantial\nredistribution of the spectral weight between the main spectral peaks and the\ninduced satellite spectrum, in the biased system it can have the opposite\neffect, i.e., it sharpens the spectral peaks and opens the HOMO-LUMO gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 11:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
