Here, we observe the\nformation and evolution of networks by monitoring the addition of all new links\nand we analyze quantitatively the tendencies used to create ties in these\nevolving online affiliation networks. We first show that an accurate estimation\nof these probabilistic tendencies can only be achieved by following the time\nevolution of the network. For example, actions that are attributed to the usual\nfriend of a friend mechanism through a static snapshot of the network are\noverestimated by a factor of two. A detailed analysis of the dynamic network\nevolution shows that half of those triangles were generated through other\nmechanisms, in spite of the characteristic static pattern. We start by\ncharacterizing every single link when the tie was established in the network.\nThis allows us to describe the probabilistic tendencies of tie formation and\nextract sociological conclusions as follows. The tendencies to add new links\ndiffer significantly from what we would expect if they were not affected by the\nindividuals' structural position in the network, i.e., from random link\nformation. We also find significant differences in behavioral traits among\nindividuals according to their degree of activity, gender, age, popularity and\nother attributes. For instance, in the particular datasets analyzed here, we\nfind that women reciprocate connections three times as much as men and this\ndifference increases with age. Men tend to connect with the most popular people\nmore often than women across all ages. On the other hand, triangular ties\ntendencies are similar and independent of gender. Our findings can be useful to\nbuild models of realistic social network structures and discover the underlying\nlaws that govern establishment of ties in evolving social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 16:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-01"}

Hence,\nclusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act as\nenergy reservoirs for additional CR sources, such as active galactic nuclei and\nsupernova-driven galactic winds. To detect the gamma-ray emission from CR\ninteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to date\nobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energy\ngamma-rays and observed the Perseus cluster with the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes\nfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. This campaign resulted in\nthe detection of the central radio galaxy NGC 1275 at energies E > 100 GeV with\na very steep energy spectrum. Here, we restrict our analysis to energies E >\n630 GeV and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. This constrains the average\nCR-to-thermal pressure ratio to be <= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and the\nmodel for CR emission. Comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictions\nfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include CRs constrains the maximum\nCR acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be < 50%.\nAlternatively, this may argue for non-negligible CR transport processes such as\nCR streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. Finally, we derive\nlower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the Perseus radio\nmini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created in\nhadronic CR interactions: assuming a spectrum of E^-2.2 around TeV energies as\nimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be > 4-9\nmicroG, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength toward\nlarger radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 16:38:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2012 00:05:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 15:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-11"}

They arise in the decoupling limit of theories of\nmassive gravity, and in some cases they have been treated in their own right as\nscalar field theories with a specific nonlinearly realized global symmetry\n(Galilean transformation). It is well known that in the presence of a source,\nthese Galileon theories admit superluminal propagating solutions, implying that\nas quantum field theories they must admit a different notion of causality than\nstandard local Lorentz invariant theories. We show that in these theories it is\neasy to construct closed timelike curves (CTCs) within the {\\it naive} regime\nof validity of the effective field theory. However, on closer inspection we see\nthat the CTCs could never arise since the Galileon inevitably becomes\ninfinitely strongly coupled at the onset of the formation of a CTC. This\nimplies an infinite amount of backreaction, first on the background for the\nGalileon field, signaling the break down of the effective field theory, and\nsubsequently on the spacetime geometry, forbidding the formation of the CTC.\nFurthermore the background solution required to create CTCs becomes unstable\nwith an arbitrarily fast decay time. Thus Galileon theories satisfy a direct\nanalogue of Hawking's chronology protection conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 16:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

For example,\nin reproductive epidemiology, one may collect pregnancy outcomes such as length\nof gestation and birth weight and predictors such as single nucleotide\npolymorphisms in multiple candidate genes and environmental exposures. In such\nsettings, there is a need for simple yet flexible methods for selecting true\npredictors of adverse health responses from a high-dimensional set of candidate\npredictors. To address this problem, one may either consider linear regression\nmodels for the continuous outcomes or convert these outcomes into binary\nindicators of adverse responses using pre-defined cutoffs. The former strategy\nhas the disadvantage of often leading to a poorly fitting model that does not\npredict risk well, while the latter approach can be very sensitive to the\ncutoff choice. As a simple yet flexible alternative, we propose a method for\nadverse subpopulation regression (ASPR), which relies on a two component latent\nclass model, with the dominant component corresponding to (presumed) healthy\nindividuals and the risk of falling in the minority component characterized via\na logistic regression. The logistic regression model is designed to accommodate\nhigh-dimensional predictors, as occur in studies with a large number of gene by\nenvironment interactions, through use of a flexible nonparametric multiple\nshrinkage approach. The Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior computation.\nThe methods are evaluated using simulation studies and applied to a genetic\nepidemiology study of pregnancy outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 17:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-24"}

In order to fix the scalar field potential we demand\nLie symmetry invariance of the field equations, which is a model-independent\nassumption. The requirement of an extra Lie symmetry selects the exponential\nscalar field potential. The further requirement that the analytic solution is\ninvariant under the point transformation generated by the Lie symmetry\neliminates dark matter and leads to a quintessence and a phantom cosmological\nmodel containing a perfect fluid and a scalar field. Next we assume that the\nLagrangian of the system admits an extra Noether symmetry. This new assumption\nselects the scalar field potential to be exponential and forces the perfect\nfluid to be stiff. Furthermore the existence of the Noether integral allows for\nthe integration of the dynamical equations. We find new analytic solutions to\nquintessence and phantom cosmologies which contain all three fluids. Using\nthese solutions one is able to compute analytically all main cosmological\nfunctions, such as the scale factor, the scalar field, the Hubble expansion\nrate, the deceleration parameter etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 17:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic\nindex Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at\nlarge radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the\nobserved mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are\nindependent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by\nfixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM\nprofile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical\nsimulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10\nallows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large\nradii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma\nand the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce\nthe observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6\nK<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium. When extrapolated to high redshift z, the model with a\nconstant Gamma reproduces the expected self-similar behaviour. We also account\nfor the observed, non-self-similar relations provided by some high-z clusters,\nas they provide constraints on the evolution of Gamma. Comparing our model to\nthe observed luminosity-temperature relation, we discriminate between different\nM-c_vir relations: a weak dependence of c_vir on M is currently preferred by\ndata. This simple theoretical model accounts for much of the complexity of\nrecent, improved X-ray scaling relations, provided that we allow for a mild\ndependence of Gamma on M or for T_xi consistent with intercluster values.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 17:59:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 20:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The stars in our simulations have masses of 0.5, 0.7, 0.9,\nand 1.1 M_sun, corresponding to spectral types K7 through G0, and rotate at the\nsame angular speed as the sun. We identify several trends of convection zone\nproperties with stellar mass, exhibited by the simulations. The convective\nvelocities, temperature contrast between up- and down-flows, and meridional\ncirculation velocities all increase with stellar luminosity. As a consequence\nof the trend in convective velocity, the Rossby number (at a fixed rotation\nrate) increases and the convective turnover timescales decrease significantly\nwith increasing stellar mass. The 3 lowest mass cases exhibit solar-like\ndifferential rotation, in a sense that they show a maximum rotation at the\nequator and minimum at higher latitudes, but the 1.1 M_sun case exhibits\nanti-solar rotation. At low mass, the meridional circulation is multi-cellular\nand aligned with the rotation axis; as the mass increases, the circulation\npattern tends toward a unicellular structure covering each hemisphere in the\nconvection zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 19:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Although a wealth of\nstructural information is available in different databases and numerous\nstructural biology softwares have been developed, rapid conformational\ncharacterization remains challenging.\n  We present here RamaDA, a program able to give a synthetic description of the\nconformation of a protein. The RamaDA program is based on a model where the\nRamachadran plot is decomposed into seven conformational domains. Within the\nframework of this model, each amino-acid of a given protein is assigned to one\nof these domains.\n  From this assignment secondary structure elements can be detected with an\naccuracy equivalent to that of the DSSP program for helices and extended\nstrands, and with the added capability of detecting PolyProline II secondary\nstructures. Additionally, the determination of a z-score for each amino-acid of\nthe protein emphasizes any irregularities in the element.\n  It is also possible to use this analysis to detect characteristic\nconformational patterns. In the case of EF-hands, calcium-binding\nhelix-loop-helix domains, it is possible to design a strict consensus for the 9\namino-acids of the loop. 523 calcium binding protein files can be found into\nthe entire PDB with this pattern and only 2.7% false positive hits are\ndetected.\n  The program RamaDA gathers several tools in one and is then able to give a\ncomplete information on a protein structure, including loops and random coil\nregions.

In recent years, evidence\nhave accumulated in favor of core accretion as the dominant mode, at least for\nclose-in planets. However, it might be hypothesized that a significant\npopulation of wide planets formed by disk instabilities could exist at large\nseparations, forming an invisible majority. In previous work, we addressed this\nissue through a direct imaging survey of B2--A0-type stars, and concluded that\n<30% of such stars form and retain planets and brown dwarfs through disk\ninstability, leaving core accretion as the likely dominant mechanism. In this\npaper, we extend this analysis to FGKM-type stars by applying a similar\nanalysis to the Gemini Deep Planet Survey (GDPS) sample. The results strengthen\nthe conclusion that substellar companions formed and retained around their\nparent stars by disk instabilities are rare. Specifically, we find that the\nfrequency of such companions is <8% for FGKM-type stars under our most\nconservative assumptions, for an outer disk radius of 300 AU, at 99%\nconfidence. Furthermore, we find that the frequency is always <10% at 99%\nconfidence independently of outer disk radius, for any radius from 5 to 500 AU.\nWe also simulate migration at a wide range of rates, and find that the\nconclusions hold even if the companions move substantially after formation.\nHence, core accretion remains the likely dominant formation mechanism for the\ntotal planet population, for every type of star from M-type through B-type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Baryons\nare able to erase the dark matter cuspy distribution creating a flat, cored,\ndark matter density profile in the central several kpc of a massive Milky-Way\nlike halo. The profile is well fit by a Burkert profile, with fitting\nparameters consistent with the observations. In addition, we obtain flat\nrotation curves as well as extended, exponential stellar disk profiles. While\nthe stellar disk we obtain is still partially too thick to resemble the MW thin\ndisk, this pilot study shows that there is enough energy available in the\nbaryonic component to alter the dark matter distribution even in massive disc\ngalaxies, providing a possible solution to the long standing problem of cusps\nvs. cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 21:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It has been claimed that a radiative\nRayleigh-Taylor instability should lead to the collapse of the outflow cavity\nand foster the growth of massive stars.\n  Aims: We investigate the stability of idealized radiation-pressure-dominated\ncavities, focusing on its dependence on the radiation transport approach for\nthe stellar radiation feedback.\n  Methods: We compare two different methods for stellar radiation feedback:\ngray flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and ray-tracing (RT). We also derive simple\nanalytical models to support our findings.\n  Results: Only the FLD cases lead to prominent instability in the cavity\nshell. The RT cases do not show such instability. The gray FLD method\nunderestimates the opacity at the location of the cavity shell and leads to\nextended epochs of marginal Eddington equilibrium in the cavity shell, making\nthem prone to the radiative Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In the RT cases, the\nradiation pressure exceeds gravity by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The radiative\nRayleigh-Taylor instability is then consequently suppressed.\n  Conclusions: Treating the stellar irradiation in the gray FLD approximation\nunderestimates the radiative forces acting on the cavity shell. This can lead\nartificially to situations that are affected by the radiative Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability. The proper treatment of direct stellar irradiation by massive\nstars is crucial for the stability of radiation-pressure-dominated cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 21:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-30"}

It allows us to estimate the state of a quantum system by measuring\ndifferent observables on many identically prepared copies of the system. This\nis, in general, a very time-consuming task that requires a large number of\nmeasurements. There are, however, systems in which the data acquisition can be\ndone more efficiently. In fact, an ensemble of quantum systems can be prepared\nand manipulated by external fields while being continuously and collectively\nprobed, producing enough information to estimate its state. This provides a\nbasis for continuous measurement quantum tomography. In this protocol, an\nensemble of identically prepared systems is collectively probed and controlled\nin a time-dependent manner to create an informationally complete continuous\nmeasurement record. The measurement history is then inverted to determine the\nstate at the initial time. We use two different estimation methods: maximum\nlikelihood and compressed sensing. The general formalism is applied to the case\nof reconstruction of the quantum state encoded in the magnetic sub-levels of a\nlarge-spin alkali atom, ${}^{133}$Cs. We apply this protocol to the case of\nreconstruction of states in the full 16-dimensional electronic-ground subspace\n($F=3 \\oplus F=4$), controlled by microwaves and radio-frequency magnetic\nfields. We present an experimental demonstration of continuous measurement\nquantum tomography in an ensemble of cold cesium atoms with full control of its\n16-dimensional Hilbert space. We show the exquisite level of control achieved\nin the lab and the excellent agreement between the theory discussed in this\ndissertation and the experimental results. This allows us to achieve fidelities\n>95% for low complexity quantum states, and >92% for arbitrary random states,\nwhich is a formidable accomplishment for a space of this size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 21:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-28"}

In this paper, we propose an efficient method for\nestimating the embedding capacity of a given cover image under multi-pass\nembedding, without actually embedding the watermark. We demonstrate this for a\nclass of reversible watermarking schemes which operate on a disjoint group of\npixels, specifically for pixel pairs. The proposed algorithm iteratively\nupdates the co-occurrence matrix at every stage, to estimate the multi-pass\nembedding capacity, and is much more efficient vis-a-vis actual watermarking.\nWe also suggest an extremely efficient, pre-computable tree based\nimplementation which is conceptually similar to the co-occurrence based method,\nbut provides the estimates in a single iteration, requiring a complexity akin\nto that of single pass capacity estimation. We also provide bounds on the\nembedding capacity. We finally show how our method can be easily used on a\nnumber of watermarking algorithms and specifically evaluate the performance of\nour algorithms on the benchmark watermarking schemes of Tian [11] and Coltuc\n[6].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 00:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-08"}

Charge ordering produces a doubling of\nthe unit cell along the c-axis with respect to the basic monoclinic CeCoAl type\nstructure. Below room temperature, a phase transition with very broad\nhysteresis has been observed in various bulk properties like electrical\nresistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. The present x-ray\ndiffraction results show that at low temperatures the doubling of the CeCoAl\ntype structure is replaced by an ill-defined modulated ground state. In this\nstate, at least three different modulation periods compete, with the dominant\nmode close to a tripling of the basic cell. The transition is accompanied by a\nsignificant contraction of the c axis. XANES data suggest that the average Ce\nvalence remains constant, thus the observed c axis contraction is not due to\nany valence transition. We propose a qualitative structure model with modified\nstacking sequences of Ce3+ and Ce(4-x)+ layers in the various modulated phases.\nSurprisingly, far below 100 K the modulated state is sensitive to x-ray\nirradiation at photon fluxes available at a synchrotron. With photon fluxes of\norder 10E12/s, the modulated ground state can be destroyed on a timescale of\nminutes and the doubling of the CeCoAl cell observed at room temperature is\nrecovered. The final state is metastable at 10 K. Heating the sample above 60 K\nagain leads to a recovery of the modulated state. Thus, CeRuSn exhibits both\nthermally and x-ray induced reversible transformations of the Ce3+/Ce(4-x)+\ncharge ordering pattern. Such a behavior is unique among any know intermetallic\ncompound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 08:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-24"}

More specifically, the energy density of the graviton\none-loop contribution to a classical energy in a wormhole background is\nconsidered as a self-consistent source for wormholes. In this semi-classical\ncontext, we consider specific choices for the Rainbow's functions and find\nsolutions for wormhole geometries in the cis-planckian and trans-planckian\nregimes. In the former regime, the wormhole spacetimes are not asymptotically\nflat and need to be matched to an exterior vacuum solution. In the latter\ntrans-planckian regime, we find that the quantum corrections are exponentially\nsuppressed, which provide asymptotically flat wormhole geometries with a\nconstant shape function, i.e., b(r)=r_t, where r_t is the wormhole throat. In\naddition to this analysis, we also fix the geometry by considering the\nbehaviour of a specific shape function through a variational approach which\nimposes a local analysis to the problem at the wormhole throat. We further\nexplore the respective parameter range of the Rainbow's functions, and find a\ngood agreement with previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 11:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-27"}

AGATA is based on the\ntechnique of gamma-ray energy tracking in electrically segmented high-purity\ngermanium crystals. This technique requires the accurate determination of the\nenergy, time and position of every interaction as a gamma ray deposits its\nenergy within the detector volume. Reconstruction of the full interaction path\nresults in a detector with very high efficiency and excellent spectral\nresponse. The realization of gamma-ray tracking and AGATA is a result of many\ntechnical advances. These include the development of encapsulated\nhighly-segmented germanium detectors assembled in a triple cluster detector\ncryostat, an electronics system with fast digital sampling and a data\nacquisition system to process the data at a high rate. The full\ncharacterization of the crystals was measured and compared with\ndetector-response simulations. This enabled pulse-shape analysis algorithms, to\nextract energy, time and position, to be employed. In addition, tracking\nalgorithms for event reconstruction were developed. The first phase of AGATA is\nnow complete and operational in its first physics campaign. In the future AGATA\nwill be moved between laboratories in Europe and operated in a series of\ncampaigns to take advantage of the different beams and facilities available to\nmaximize its science output. The paper reviews all the achievements made in the\nAGATA project including all the necessary infrastructure to operate and support\nthe spectrometer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 11:33:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 15:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-18"}

In this case,\nstandard coding techniques are either prohibitively complex to decode, or\nrequire network-source coding separation, resulting in sub-optimal transmission\nrates. To alleviate this problem, we offer a joint network-source coding scheme\nbased on matrix sparsification at the code design phase, which allows the\nterminals to use an efficient decoding procedure (syndrome decoding using\nLDPC), despite the network coding throughout the network. Via a novel relation\nbetween matrix sparsification and rate-distortion theory, we give lower and\nupper bounds on the best achievable sparsification performance. These bounds\nallow us to analyze our scheme, and, in particular, show that in the limit\nwhere all receivers have comparable side information (in terms of conditional\nentropy), or, equivalently, have weak side information, a vanishing density can\nbe achieved. As a result, efficient decoding is possible at all terminals\nsimultaneously.

Based on start to end simulations we show that the FEL power of the\ntransform-limited pulses can reach about 100 GW by exploiting tapering in the\ntunable-gap baseline undulator. The combination of high photon energy, high\npeak power, and very narrow bandwidth opens a vast new range of applications,\nand includes the possibility to considerably increase the user capacity and\nfully exploit the high repetition rate of the European XFEL. In fact, dealing\nwith monochromatic hard X-ray radiation one may use crystals as deflectors with\nminimum beam loss. To this end, a photon beam distribution system based on the\nuse of crystals in the Bragg reflection geometry is proposed for future study\nand possible extension of the baseline facility. They can be repeated a number\nof times to form an almost complete (one meter scale) ring with an angle of 20\ndegrees between two neighboring lines. The reflectivity of crystal deflectors\ncan be switched fast enough by flipping the crystals with piezo-electric\ndevices similar to those for X-ray phase retarders at synchrotron radiation\nfacilities. It is then possible to distribute monochromatic hard X-rays among\n10 independent instruments, thereby enabling 10 users to work in parallel.

For some proposals, such as XACML, the\nmain motivation is to address real-world requirements, typically by providing a\ncomplex policy language with somewhat informal evaluation methods; others try\nto provide a greater degree of formality (particularly with respect to policy\nevaluation) but support far fewer features. In short, there are very few\nproposals that combine a rich set of language features with a well-defined\nsemantics, and even fewer that do this for authorization policies for\nattribute-based access control in open environments. In this paper, we\ndecompose the problem of policy specification into two distinct sub-languages:\nthe policy target language (PTL) for target specification, which determines\nwhen a policy should be evaluated; and the policy composition language (PCL)\nfor building more complex policies from existing ones. We define syntax and\nsemantics for two such languages and demonstrate that they can be both simple\nand expressive. PTaCL, the language obtained by combining the features of these\ntwo sub-languages, supports the specification of a wide range of policies.\nHowever, the power of PTaCL means that it is possible to define policies that\ncould produce unexpected results. We provide an analysis of how PTL should be\nrestricted and how policies written in PCL should be evaluated to minimize the\nlikelihood of undesirable results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 14:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-28"}

As previously\nnoted by several authors, low-mass clusters and groups of galaxies display\nsystematically larger concentrations than simple prescriptions based on pure\n$n$-body simulations would predict. This implies an observed concentration-mass\nrelation with a substantially larger slope/normalization than expected from\ntheoretical investigations. Additionally, this conclusion seems to be quite\nindependent on selection effects, holding for both lensing based and X-ray\nbased cluster samples. In order to shed new light on this issue I employ a\nsimple spherical halo model containing, in addition to dark matter, also stars\nand hot diffuse gas in proportions and with distributions in agreement with the\nmost recent observations. Moreover, I include the contraction effect\nexperienced by dark matter due to the cooling of baryons in the very central\npart of the structure itself. The resulting modified concentration-mass\nrelation is steeper than the theoretical input one, because star formation is\nfractionally more efficient in low-mass objects. However, the effect is\nnon-vanishing at all masses, thus resulting also in a larger normalization.\nOverall the new relation provides a better representation of the observed one\nfor almost all catalogs considered in this work, although the specific details\ndepend quite significantly on the baryon fraction prescription adopted. Anyhow,\nthe same effect could also be produced by a redistribution of baryons within\nthe structure.

We show that the\nDirac prescription solves a problem of inconsistency plaguing all available\nmodels which neglect radiation reaction, namely, the fact that in all such\nmodels most initial data lead to a spontaneous breakdown of the atom.

In this model, transmitters are distributed as a\nPoisson point process and energy arrives at each transmitter randomly with a\nuniform average rate called the energy arrival rate; upon harvesting sufficient\nenergy, each transmitter transmits with fixed power to an intended receiver\nunder an outage-probability constraint for a target\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. It is assumed that transmitters store\nenergy in batteries with infinite capacity. By applying the random-walk theory,\nthe probability that a transmitter transmits, called the transmission\nprobability, is proved to be equal to one if the energy-arrival rate exceeds\ntransmission power or otherwise is equal to their ratio. This result and tools\nfrom stochastic geometry are applied to maximize the network throughput for a\ngiven energy-arrival rate by optimizing transmission power. The maximum network\nthroughput is shown to be proportional to the optimal transmission probability,\nwhich is equal to one if the transmitter density is below a derived function of\nthe energy-arrival rate or otherwise is smaller than one and solves a given\npolynomial equation.

Whilst it has been established that GRBs are related to the death\nthroes of massive stars, the identification of their progenitors has proved\nchallenging. Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best\ncandidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a\ndirect measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry\nmay be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.\nSpectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have\nspherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%\nminority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here\nwe find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the\nsignature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae\nthat have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue\nvariable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass\nloss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date. When we\ntake recently published WR ejecta nebula numbers we find that five out of the\nsix line-effect WR stars are surrounded by ejecta nebulae. The statistics imply\nthat the null hypothesis of no correlation between line-effect WR stars and\nejecta nebulae can be rejected at the 0.0004% level. Given that four\nline-effect and WR ejecta nebula have spectroscopically been confirmed to\ncontain nucleosynthetic products, we argue that the correlation is both\nstatistically significant and physically convincing. The implication is that we\nhave identified a WR sub-population that fulfills the necessary criteria for\nmaking GRBs. Finally, we discuss the potential of identifying GRB progenitors\nvia spectropolarimetry with extremely large telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 15:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 14:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
