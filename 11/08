As\na consequence, the frequency evolution in transients has received much less\nattention than the wave energy density or growth factor. By carrying out a\nlarge number of long term transient simulations for longitudinal, oblique and\northogonal perturbations in the plane channel and wake flows, we could observe\na complex time evolution of the frequency. The complexity is mainly associated\nto jumps which appear quite far along within the transients. We interpret these\njumps as the transition between the early transient and the beginning of an\nintermediate term that reveals itself for times large enough for the influence\nof the fine details of the initial condition to disappear. The intermediate\nterm leads to the asymptotic exponential state and has a duration one order of\nmagnitude longer than the early term, which indicates the existence of an\nintermediate asymptotics. Since after the intermediate term perturbations die\nout or blowup, the mid-term can be considered as the most probable state in the\nperturbation life. Long structured transients can be related to the spot\npatterns commonly observed in subcritical transitional wall flows. By\nconsidering a large group of 3D waves in a narrow range of wavenumbers, we\nsuperposed them in a finite temporal window with oblique and longitudinal waves\nrandomly delayed with respect to an orthogonal wave which is supposed to\nsustain the spot formation with its intense transient growth.

Overall our new scheme has the good features of\nhaving a zero-knowledge security proof based on well known hard problem of\ncoding theory, a small size of secret and public key (a few hundred bits), a\nsmall calculation complexity, for an overall communication cost of 19kb for\nauthentication (for a $2^{16}$ security) and a signature of size of 93kb\n(11.5kB) (for security $2^{80}$), an improvement of 40% compared to previous\nschemes based on coding theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 17:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}

NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) contains an\nintramolecular chain of seven iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters, one of the longest\nchains of metal centres in biology and a test case for physical models of\nintramolecular ET. In biology, intramolecular ET is commonly described as a\ndiffusive hopping process, according to the semi-classical theories of Marcus\nand Hopfield. However, recent studies have raised the possibility that\nnon-trivial quantum mechanical effects play a functioning role in certain\nbiomolecular processes. Here, we extend the semi-classical model for biological\nET to incorporate both semi-classical and coherent quantum phenomena using a\nquantum master equation based on the Holstein Hamiltonian. We test our model on\nthe structurally-defined chain of FeS clusters in complex I. By exploring a\nwide range of realistic parameters we find that, when the energy profile for ET\nalong the chain is relatively flat, just a small coherent contribution can\nprovide a robust and significant increase in ET rate (above the semi-classical\ndiffusive-hopping rate), even at physiologically-relevant temperatures.\nConversely, when the on-site energies vary significantly along the chain the\ncoherent contribution is negligible. For complex I, a crucial respiratory\nenzyme that is linked to many neuromuscular and degenerative diseases, our\nresults suggest a new contribution towards ensuring that intramolecular ET does\nnot limit the rate of catalysis. For the emerging field of quantum biology, our\nmodel is intended as a basis for elucidating the general role of coherent ET in\nbiological ET reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 17:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 17:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

In this model\nreionization can be either: (A) externally-driven and uniform, or (B)\ninternally-driven, by the most massive progenitor of the Milky Way. In the\nlatter scenario the propagation of the ionisation front and photon dilution\nintroduce a delay in the photo-evaporation of the outer satellites' gas with\nrespect to the inner satellites. As a consequence, outer satellites experience\na longer period of star formation than those in the inner halo. We use simple\nmodels to account for star formation, the propagation of the ionisation front,\nphoto-evaporation and observational biases.

Progress in using it as a cosmic SFR tracer requires\nsome confidence that it is consistent with more conventional SFR diagnostics in\nthe nearby Universe. This paper compares standard SFR measurements based on\nHalpha, FUV and TIR galaxy luminosities with the observed CCSN rate in the same\ngalaxy sample. The comparison can be viewed from two perspectives. Firstly, by\nadopting an estimate of the minimum stellar mass to produce a CCSN one can\ndetermine a SFR from SN numbers. Secondly, the radiative SFRs can be assumed to\nbe robust and then the SN statistics provide a constrain on the minimum stellar\nmass for CCSN progenitors. The novel aspect of this study is that Halpha, FUV\nand TIR luminosities are now available for a complete galaxy sample within the\nlocal 11Mpc volume and the number of discovered SNe in this sample within the\nlast 13 years is high enough to perform a meaningful statistical comparison. We\nexploit the multi-wavelength dataset from 11HUGS, a volume-limited survey\ndesigned to provide a census of SFR in the local Volume. Assuming a lower limit\nfor CCSN progenitors of 8 Msun, the CCSN rate matches the SFR from the FUV\nluminosity. However the SFR based on Halpha luminosity is lower than these two\nestimates by a factor of nearly 2. If we assume that the FUV or Halpha based\nluminosities are a true reflection of the SFR, we find that the minimum mass\nfor CCSN progenitors is 8 +/- 1 Msun, and 6 +/- 1 Msun, respectively. The\nestimate of the minimum mass for CCSN progenitors obtained exploiting FUV data\nis in good agreement with that from the direct detection of CCSN progenitors.\nThe concordant results by these independent methods point toward a constraint\nof 8 +/- 1 Msun on the lower mass limit for progenitor stars of CCSNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 19:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The V-I vs I-K' colour-colour\ndiagram is found to break the age-metallicity degeneracy present in optical\ncolours, as I-K' primarily measures a populations' metallicity and is\nrelatively insensitive, unlike optical spectroscopy, to the effect of hot\nhorizontal branch (HB) stars, known to be present in massive old GCs. We derive\nGCs' photometric age, Z and masses. In general, metal-poor ([Z/H]<-0.7dex) GCs\nare older than more metal-rich GCs. For the most massive GCs (M>6x10^5 M_sol)\nin NGC 3610 with available spectroscopic data, photometric ages are older by ~2\nGyr, and this difference is more pronounced for the metal-poor GCs. However,\nphotometric and spectroscopic metallicities are in good agreement. We suggest\nthat this indicates the presence of a hot HB in these massive clusters, which\nrenders spectroscopic ages from Balmer line strengths to be underestimated.

With the advent of comprehensive relic\nsamples a framework is needed to analyze statistically the relic abundance.

Our\nmodel is able to reproduce the recently found tentative evidence for an\nincrease in the fraction of clusters hosting relics, both with X-ray luminosity\nand redshift, using an X-ray flux limited cluster sample. Moreover, we find\nthat a considerable fraction of faint relics (S_1.4 < ~10 mJy) reside in\nclusters with an X-ray flux below ~3e-12 erg/s/cm^2.

Font et\nal. have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfully\nreproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surface\nbrightness profiles of the spheroids of the Milky Way and M31. A key to the\nsuccess of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from\nstars that formed in situ. While the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars,\nstars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r < ~30 kpc. In\nthe present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a\nproto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by\ndynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of its\norigin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namely\nnet prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroid\ncomponent built from the disruption of satellites. In addition, the in situ\ncomponent has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation. We\nmake comparisons with measurements of the shape and kinematics of local\ngalaxies, including the Milky Way and M31, and stacked observations of more\ndistant galaxies. We find that the simulated disc galaxies have spheroids of\nthe correct shape (oblate with a median axis ratio of ~0.6 at radii of < ~30\nkpc, but note there is significant system-to-system scatter in this quantity)\nand that the kinematics show evidence for two components (due to in situ vs.\naccreted), as observed.

We consider geometries resulting in\neither isotropic or anisotropic effective opacity, and, in addition to an\nidealised model in which all clumps have the same local overdensity and scale,\nwe also treat an ensemble of clumps with optical depths set by Markovian\nstatistics. This formalism is then applied to the specific case of bound-free\nabsorption of X-rays in hot star winds, a process not directly affected by\nclumping in the optically thin limit. We find that the Markov model gives\nsurprisingly similar results to those found previously for the single clump\nmodel, suggesting that porous opacity is not very sensitive to details of the\nassumed clump distribution function. Further, an anisotropic effective opacity\nfavours escape of X-rays emitted in the tangential direction (the `venetian\nblind' effect), resulting in a 'bump' of higher flux close to line centre as\ncompared to profiles computed from isotropic porosity models. We demonstrate\nhow this characteristic line shape may be used to diagnose the clump geometry,\nand we confirm previous results that for optically thick clumping to\nsignificantly influence X-ray line profiles, very large porosity lengths,\ndefined as the mean free path between clumps, are required. Moreover, we\npresent the first X-ray line profiles computed directly from line-driven\ninstability simulations using a 3-D patch method, and find that porosity\neffects from such models also are very small. This further supports the view\nthat porosity has, at most, a marginal effect on X-ray line diagnostics in O\nstars, and therefore that these diagnostics do indeed provide a good `clumping\ninsensitive' method for deriving O star mass-loss rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 22:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We comment on the\ntendency of some methods, particularly those with very low numerical diffusion,\nto produce secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz billows on similar tests. Though the lack\nof a fixed, physical diffusive scale in the Euler equations lies at the root of\nthe issue, we suggest that in some methods an extra diffusion operator should\nbe used to damp the growth of instabilities arising from grid noise.

Our theoretical framework is based on a\ntwo-component self-assembled Ising model in which the bidispersity is\nparameterized in terms of the strengths of the binding free energies that\ndepend on the monomer species involved in the pairing interaction. Depending\nupon the relative values of the binding free energies involved, different\nmorphologies of assemblies that include both components are formed, exhibiting\nparamagnetic-, ferromagnetic- or anti ferromagnetic-like order, i.e., random,\nblocky or alternating ordering of the two components in the assemblies.\nAnalyzing the model for the case of ferromagnetic ordering, which is of most\npractical interest, we find that the transition from conditions of minimal\nassembly to those characterized by strong polymerization can be described by a\ncritical concentration that depends on the concentration ratio of the two\nspecies. Interestingly, the distribution of monomers in the assemblies is\ndifferent from that in the original distribution, i.e., the ratio of the\nconcentrations of the two components put into the system. The monomers with a\nsmaller binding free energy are more abundant in short assemblies and monomers\nwith a larger binding affinity are more abundant in longer assemblies.

We explore several techniques for building the cluster, with\nthe number of operations required depending on whether we allow the ability to\ndestroy previously created controlled-phase links between qubits. In the case\nwhere we can not destroy these links, we show how to create an n x m cluster\nusing just 3nm -2n -3m/2 + 3 operations. This gives more than a factor of 2\nsaving over a naive method. Further savings can be obtained if we include the\nability to destroy links, in which case we only need (8nm-4n-4m-8)/3\noperations. Unfortunately the latter scheme is more complicated so choosing the\ncorrect order to interact the qubits is considerably more difficult. A half way\nscheme, that keeps a modular generation but saves additional operations over\nnever destroying links requires only 3nm-2n-2m+4 operations.

In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates\nbenefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify PCA\nagainst outliers. A least-trimmed squares estimator of a low-rank bilinear\nfactor analysis model is shown closely related to that obtained from an\n$\\ell_0$-(pseudo)norm-regularized criterion encouraging sparsity in a matrix\nexplicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests robust PCA schemes\nbased on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a family of robust\nestimators encompassing Huber's optimal M-class as a special case. Outliers are\nidentified by tuning a regularization parameter, which amounts to controlling\nsparsity of the outlier matrix along the whole robustification path of (group)\nleast-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) solutions.

We detected and\ncharacterized four highly energetic optical flares having U-band total energies\nof ~7.8x10^30 to ~1.3x10^32 ergs, and found no corresponding response in the J,\nH, or Ks bandpasses at the precision of our data.

To date about two thirds of them, plus a few\nsimilar systems without known CRSFs, have been observed with Suzaku. We present\nan overview of results from these observations, including the discovery of a\nCRSF in the transient 1A 1118-61 and pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of GX\n301-2. These observations allow for the determination of cyclotron line\nparameters to an unprecedented degree of accuracy within a moderate amount of\nobserving time. This is important since these parameters vary - e.g., with\norbital phase, pulse phase, or luminosity - depending on the geometry of the\nmagnetic field of the pulsar and the properties of the accretion column at the\nmagnetic poles. We briefly introduce a spectral model for CRSFs that is\ncurrently being developed and that for the first time is based on these\nphysical properties. In addition to cyclotron line measurements, selected\nhighlights from the Suzaku analyses include dip and flare studies, e.g., of 4U\n1907+09 and Vela X-1, which show clumpy wind effects (like partial absorption\nand/or a decrease in the mass accretion rate supplied by the wind) and may also\ndisplay magnetospheric gating effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 04:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this paper we generalize the palindromization map,\nstarting with a given code $X$ over $A$. The new map $\\psi_X$ maps $X^*$ to the\nset $PAL$ of palindromes of $A^*$. In this way some properties of $\\psi$ are\nlost and some are saved in a weak form. When $X$ has a finite deciphering delay\none can extend $\\psi_X$ to $X^{\\omega}$, generating a class of infinite words\nmuch wider than standard episturmian words. For a finite and maximal code $X$\nover $A$, we give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words,\ncalled $X$-AR words. We prove that any $X$-AR word is a morphic image of a\nstandard Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and\nupper bounds to its factor complexity.\n  For any code $X$ we say that $\\psi_X$ is conservative when\n$\\psi_X(X^{*})\\subseteq X^{*}$.

Two\npossible explanations are that (i) the host galaxy is simply not detected\nwithin the sensitivity of the available data or that (ii) the progenitor is a\nhypervelocity star that has escaped its parent galaxy. We use the Type IIb SN\n2009Z as a prototype of case (i), an example of how a very faint (here Low\nSurface Brightness; LSB) galaxy can be discovered via the observation of a\nseemingly host-less SN. By identifying and studying LSB galaxies that host SNe\nrelated to the death of massive stars, we can place constraints on the stellar\npopulation and environment of LSB galaxies, which at present are poorly\nunderstood. From an HI spectrum, a redshift of z = 0.02513+-0.00001 and an HI\nmass of (2.96+-0.12) 10^9 M_sun are computed. This redshift is consistent with\nthat obtained from optical emission lines of SN 2009Z. Furthermore, a gas mass\nfraction of f_g = 0.87+-0.04 is obtained, one of the highest fractions ever\nmeasured.

However,\nthese are commonly unable to fully reconcile theoretical predictions with\nobservations. In contrast, the recently revised two level system (TLS) model\nseems to provide a promising way of interpreting the existing data. The newly\navailable Herschel Hi-GAL data which covers most of the inner Milky-Way offers\na unique opportunity to investigate possible variations in the dust emission\nproperties both with wavelength and environment.

We then\nconsider the setting in which an additional on-site potential is present,\nmotivated by the Newton's cradle under the effect of gravity. Using both direct\nnumerical computations and a simplified asymptotic model of the oscillator\nchain, the so-called discrete p-Schr\\\"odinger (DpS) equation, we show the\nexistence of discrete breathers and study their spectral properties and\nmobility. Due to the fully nonlinear character of Hertzian interactions,\nbreathers are found to be much more localized than in classical nonlinear\nlattices and their motion occurs with less dispersion. In addition, we study\nnumerically the excitation of a traveling breather after an impact at one end\nof a semi-infinite chain. This case is well described by the DpS equation when\nlocal oscillations are faster than binary collisions, a situation occuring e.g.\nin chains of stiff cantilevers decorated by spherical beads.

We present an analytical model to describe this process\nusing the simplifying assumption that each particle's dynamics is dominated by\na single planet at a time. As such the scattering process can be considered as\na series of three body problems during each of which the Tisserand parameter\nwith respect to the relevant planet is conserved. This constrains the orbital\nparameter space into which a particle can be scattered. Such arguments have\npreviously been applied to the process by which comets are scattered to the\ninner Solar System from the Kuiper belt. Our analysis generalises this for an\narbitrary planetary system. For particles scattered from an outer belt directly\nalong a chain of planets, based on the initial value of the Tisserand\nparameter, we find that it is possible to (i) determine which planets can eject\nthe particles from the system, (ii) define a minimum stellar distance to which\nparticles can be scattered, and (iii) constrain range of particle inclinations\n(and hence the disc height) at different distances. Applying this to the Solar\nSystem, we determine that the planets are close to optimally separated for\nscattering particles between them. Concerning warm dust found around stars that\nalso have Kuiper belt analogues, we show that, if there is to be a dynamical\nlink between the outer and inner regions, then certain architectures for the\nintervening planetary system are incapable of producing the observations.\nFurthermore we show that for certain planetary systems, comets can be scattered\nfrom an outer belt, or with fewer constraints, from an Oort cloud analogue,\nonto star-grazing orbits, in support of a planetary origin to the metal\npollution and dustiness of some nearby white dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 10:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Even though the hot, diffuse\nphase of the ISM receives a significant amount of metals from the stars, the\ncold phase is efficiently shielded, with very little metal enrichment.\nSignificant enrichment of the cold ISM will therefore be delayed by at least\nthe cooling time of this hot phase. No variations in cloud metallicity with\ndistance from the OB association or with direction are found, which means that\nthe shell collision does little to enhance the metallicity of the cold clumps.\nWe conclude that the stellar generation that forms out of molecular structures,\ntriggered by shell collisions cannot be significantly enriched.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 10:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

Both approaches become exact for quadratic\nHamiltonians. The apparent contradiction is resolved building on an observation\nby Huber, Heller and Littlejohn, that complexified coherent states are\nequivalent if their centres lie on a specific complex Lagrangian manifold.

In particular, we study how the measured\nproperties of subhaloes vary as a function of the parent halo mass, the\nphysical properties of the parent halo, and redshift. The fraction of halo mass\nin substructures increases with increasing mass. There is, however, a very\nlarge halo-to-halo scatter that can be explained only in part by a range of\nhalo physical properties, e.g. concentration. At given halo mass, less\nconcentrated haloes contain significantly larger fractions of mass in\nsubstructures because of the reduced strength of tidal disruption. Most of the\nsubstructure mass is located at the outskirts of the parent haloes, in\nrelatively few massive subhaloes. This mass segregation appears to become\nstronger at increasing redshift, and should reflect into a more significant\nmass segregation of the galaxy population at different cosmic epochs. When\nhaloes are accreted onto larger structures, their mass is significantly reduced\nby tidal stripping. Haloes that are more massive at the time of accretion\n(these should host more luminous galaxies) are brought closer to the centre on\nshorter time-scales by dynamical friction, and therefore suffer of a more\nsignificant stripping. The halo merger rate depends strongly on the environment\nwith substructure in more massive haloes suffering more important mergers than\ntheir counterparts residing in less massive systems.

This repulsion acts to stabilize nuclear\nmatter against isoscalar density oscillations, a feature which is absent in\ncalculations employing low-momentum two-nucleon interactions only.

The solutions for protoplanetary discs show\nthat in situation of $\\Omega \\tau_{cool} = constant$, the disc does not show\nany gravitational instability in small radii for a typically mass accretion\nrate, $\\dot{M} = 10^{-6} M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}$, while by choosing $\\Omega\n\\tau_{cool}$ as a function of temperature, the gravitational instability for\nthis amount of mass accretion rate or even less can occur in small radii. Also,\nby study of the viscous parameter $\\alpha$, we find that the strength of\nturbulence in the inner part of self-gravitating protoplanetary discs is very\nlow. These results are qualitatively consistent with direct numerical\nsimulations of protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 15:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-11"}
