These two features enable to bridge the gap between\nparametric and nonparametric theory and to build a unified framework for\nstatistical estimation.

The SSE generates a spin voltage as a result of a\ntemperature gradient in a ferromagnet, which injects a spin current into an\nattached paramagnetic metal. In the paramagnet, this spin current is converted\ninto an electric field due to the ISHE, enabling the electric detection of the\nSSE. The observation of the SSE is performed in longitudinal and transverse\nconfigurations consisting of a ferromagnet/paramagnet hybrid structure, where\nthermally generated spin currents flowing parallel and perpendicular to the\ntemperature gradient are detected, respectively. Our results explain the SSE in\nterms of a two-step process: (1) the temperature gradient creates a\nnon-equilibrium state in the ferromagnet governed by both magnon and phonon\npropagations and (2) the non-equilibrium between magnons in the ferromagnet and\nelectrons in the paramagnet at the contact interface leads to \"thermal spin\npumping\" and the ISHE signal.

For small $R_{12}$ the superconducting order parameter is only\nsuppressed to some extent near the surface for the both bands. For intermediate\nand strong interband scattering there are two possible non-trivial surface\nstates of the order parameter: (i) purely real solution, where the symmetry of\nthe superconducting state near the surface is changed from $s_{\\pm}$ to\nconventional $s_{++}$ and (ii) time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRB) state.

Here, we extend that approach to consider the\ninfluence of Jupiter's orbital eccentricity and inclination on the impact rate.\n  We first consider scenarios in which Jupiter's orbital eccentricity was\nsomewhat higher and somewhat lower than that in our Solar System. We find that\nJupiter's orbital eccentricity plays a moderate role in determining the impact\nflux at Earth, with more eccentric orbits resulting in a higher impact rate of\nasteroids than for more circular orbits. This is particularly pronounced at\nhigh \"Jupiter\" masses. For short-period comets, the same effect is clearly\napparent, albeit to a lesser degree. The flux of short-period comets impacting\nthe Earth is slightly higher for more eccentric Jovian orbits.\n  We also consider scenarios in which Jupiter's orbital inclination was greater\nthan that in our Solar System. Increasing Jupiter's orbital inclination greatly\nincreased the flux of asteroidal impactors. However, at the highest tested\ninclination, the disruption to the Asteroid belt was so great that the belt\nwould be entirely depleted after an astronomically short period of time. In\nsuch a system, the impact flux from asteroid bodies would therefore be very\nlow, after an initial period of intense bombardment. By contrast, the influence\nof Jovian inclination on impacts from short-period comets was very small. A\nslight reduction in the impact flux was noted for the moderate and high\ninclination scenarios considered in this work - the results for inclinations of\nfive and twenty-five degrees were essentially identical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 09:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Here,\nwe study how fragmentation of self-gravitating disc flows in SPH depends upon\nthe implementation of cooling. We run disc simulations that compare a simple\ncooling scheme, in which each particle loses energy based upon its internal\nenergy per unit mass, with a method in which the cooling is derived from a\nsmoothed internal energy density field. For the simple per particle cooling\nscheme, we find a significant increase in the minimum cooling time scale for\nfragmentation with increasing resolution, matching previous results. Switching\nto smoothed cooling, however, results in lower critical cooling time scales,\nand tentative evidence for convergence at the highest spatial resolution\ntested. We conclude that precision studies of fragmentation using SPH require\ncareful consideration of how cooling (and, probably, artificial viscosity) is\nimplemented, and that the apparent non-convergence of the fragmentation\nboundary seen in prior simulations is likely a numerical effect. In real discs,\nwhere cooling is physically smoothed by radiative transfer effects, the\nfragmentation boundary is probably displaced from the two-dimensional value by\na factor that is only of the order of unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 09:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

These spurious\ncontaminations whether noise or foreground residuals are well-known to be a\nplague for most cosmologically relevant tests or evaluations; this includes CMB\nlensing reconstruction or non-Gaussian signatures search. Noise reduction is\ngenerally performed by applying a simple Wiener filter in spherical harmonics;\nhowever this does not account for the non-stationarity of the noise.

The main motivation of this work was to study\nthis connection in the case of correlated input bits. Our approach to forge\nthis connection was to propose a new postulate called Accessibility of Mutual\nInformation (AMI) on the underling physical theory. This approach, explained in\nthe first version of this paper, fails since AMI is not satisfied by the\nquantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 09:34:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 10:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-04"}

In the case of QED, the\ninteraction of tidal forces with the vacuum polarization cloud of virtual e^+\ne^- pairs dressing the renormalized photon has been shown to produce several\nnovel phenomena. In particular, the photon field amplitude can locally increase\nas well as decrease, corresponding to a negative imaginary part of the\nrefractive index, in apparent violation of unitarity and the optical theorem.\nBelow threshold decays into e^+ e^- pairs may also occur. In this paper, these\nissues are studied from the point of view of a non-equilibrium initial-value\nproblem, with the field evolution from an initial null surface being calculated\nfor physically distinct initial conditions and for both scalar field theories\nand QED. It is shown how a generalised version of the optical theorem, valid in\ncurved spacetime, allows a local increase in amplitude while maintaining\nconsistency with unitarity. The picture emerges of the field being dressed and\nundressed as it propagates through curved spacetime, with the local\ngravitational tidal forces determining the degree of dressing and hence the\namplitude of the renormalized quantum field. These effects are illustrated with\nmany examples, including a description of the undressing of a photon in the\nvicinity of a black hole singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 10:56:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 09:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The sign of $\\sin\\theta_{13}$ also\nplays a crucial role in the determination of the CP-violating phase. In this\nwork we show that by adopting an alternative parametrization for the\nPontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) mixing matrix, one already has a chance\nto infer the sign of each mixing angle in the conventional parametrization\nusing existing global neutrino data.

Owing to the strong correlations among the three mixing angles\nin the new parametrization, the advantages of doing the global neutrino\noscillation analysis using data from past, current, and near future neutrino\noscillation experiments shall become manifest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 10:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

To answer this question, we\nderive both an upper and a lower bound for the probability that a particular\nnode is infective in a susceptible-infective-susceptible model for two cases of\nspreading processes: reactive and contact processes. The bounds are derived by\nconsidering the $n-$hop neighborhood of the node; the bounds are tighter as one\nuses a larger $n-$hop neighborhood to calculate them.

The\nformation of the penumbra is intimately related to the inclined magnetic field.\nWithin 4.5 h observing time, the magnetic flux of the penumbra increases from\n9.7E+20 to 18.2E+20 Mx, while the magnetic flux of the umbra remains constant\nat about 3.8E+20 Mx. Magnetic flux in the immediate surroundings is\nincorporated into the spot, and new flux is supplied via small flux patches\n(SFPs), which on average have a flux of 2-3E+18 Mx. The spot's flux increase\nrate of 4.2E+16 Mx/s corresponds to the merging of one SFP per minute. We also\nfind that during the formation of the spot penumbra: a) the maximum magnetic\nfield strength of the umbra does not change, b) the magnetic neutral line keeps\nthe same position relative to the umbra, c) the new flux arrives on the\nemergence side of the spot while the penumbra forms on the opposite side, d)\nthe average LRF inclination of the light bridges decreases from 50 to 37 deg,\nand e) as the penumbra develops, the mean magnetic field strength at the spot\nborder decreases from 1.0 to 0.8 kG. The SFPs associated with elongated\ngranules are the building blocks of structure formation in active regions.\nDuring the sunspot formation, their contribution is comparable to the\ncoalescence of pores. A quiet environment in the surroundings is important for\npenumbral formation. As remnants of trapped granulation between merging pores,\nthe light bridges are found to play a crucial role in the formation process.\nThey seem to channel the magnetic flux through the spot during its formation.\nLight bridges are also the locations where the first penumbral filaments form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 12:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

The Dual Zone Phase Mask (DZPM)\ncoronagraph constitutes a promising concept since it theoretically offers a\nsmall inner working angle (IWA \\sim \\lambda_0/D), good achromaticity and high\nstarlight rejection, typically reaching a 1e6 contrast at 5 \\lambda_0/D from\nthe star over a spectral bandwidth \\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_0 of 25% (similar to\nH-band).

Contrast levels higher than 1e6 are\nhowever required for the observation of older and/or less massive companions\nover a finite spectral bandwidth. An achromatization improvement of the DZPM\ncoronagraph is therefore mandatory to reach such performance. In its design,\nthe DZPM coronagraph uses a grey (or achromatic) apodization. We propose to\nreplace it by a colored apodization to increase the performance of this\ncoronagraphic system over a large spectral range. This innovative concept,\ncalled Colored Apodizer Phase Mask (CAPM) coronagraph, is defined with some\ndesign parameters optimized to reach the best contrast in the exoplanet search\narea. Once this done, we study the performance of the CAPM coronagraph in the\npresence of different errors to evaluate the sensitivity of our concept. A 2.5\nmag contrast gain is estimated from the performance provided by the CAPM\ncoronagraph with respect to that of the DZPM coronagraph. A 2.2e-8 intensity\nlevel at 5 \\lambda_0/D separation is then theoretically achieved with the CAPM\ncoronagraph in the presence of a clear circular aperture and a 25% bandwidth.\nIn addition, our studies show that our concept is less sensitive to low than\nhigh-order aberrations for a given value of rms wavefront errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 12:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It's shown that a\nlarger effective area of the ground-based antenna allows us to measure a weaker\nsolar emission and to distinguish a fine structure of strong solar events. This\nfeature has been also verified by simultaneous ground- and space-based\nobservations in the overlapping frequency range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 14:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

The\ncompression is represented by straight-line programs (SLPs), i.e. a\ncontext-free grammars generating exactly one string; the term fully means that\nboth the pattern and the text are given in the compressed form. The problem is\napproached using a recently developed technique of local recompression: the\nSLPs are refactored, so that substrings of the pattern and text are encoded in\nboth SLPs in the same way.

Recent results for small quark masses in simulations\nwith 2+1 flavors show scaling behavior consistent with the O(4) or O(2)\nuniversality class. For a precise determination, an assessment of deviations\nfrom the ideal scaling behavior due to finite quark masses and finite\nsimulation volumes is necessary.\n  We study the scaling behavior at the chiral phase transition with an\neffective quark-meson model. In our Renormalization Group approach, the quark\nmasses in the model can be varied from the chiral limit over a wide range of\nvalues, which allows us to estimate scaling deviations due to large quark\nmasses and the extent of the scaling region. We conclude that scaling\ndeviations are already large at pion masses of 75 MeV, but that the effect is\ndifficult to see in the absence of results for even smaller masses. Comparing\nresults only in a narrow window of pion masses leads to the observation of\napparent scaling behavior. While the scaling deviations are not necessarily\nuniversal, we expect that this may affect current lattice simulation results.\n  By placing the system in a finite box, we investigate the transition between\ninfinite-volume scaling behavior and finite-size scaling. We estimate that\nfinite-size scaling behavior can be tested in regions where pion mass times box\nsize is approximately 2 - 3, which is smaller than in most current lattice\nsimulations. We expect that finite-volume effects are small for pion masses of\n75 MeV and lattice aspect ratios with TL > 8, but that they will become\nsignificant when pion masses in lattice simulations become smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 15:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

The former TRS\n(symmetry class BDI) can for example be realized when the Dirac fermions emerge\nfrom spinless fermions hopping on a 2D lattice with a linear energy dispersion\nsuch as the honeycomb lattice (graphene) or the square lattice with $\\pi$-flux\nper plaquette.
