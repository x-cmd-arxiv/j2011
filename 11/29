However, in general,\nthe interval may not be equal to the support of the marginal distribution. In\nthis case, the SIS procedure may produce tables which do not satisfy the\nmarginal constraints, leading to rejection Chen et al 2006. In this paper we\nconsider the uniform distribution as the target distribution. First we show\nthat if we fix the number of rows and columns of the design matrix of the model\nfor contingency tables then there exists a polynomial time algorithm in terms\nof the input size to sample a table from the set of all tables satisfying all\nmarginals defined by the given model via the SIS procedure without rejection.\nWe then show experimentally that in general the SIS procedure may have large\nrejection rates even with small tables.

In\nparticular, in the symmetric tridiagonal case where differential qd algorithm\nwith shifts (dqds) proposed by Fernando and Parlett enjoys often faster\nconvergence while preserving high relative accuracy (that is not guaranteed in\nQR algorithm). In eigenvalue computations for rank-structured matrices QR\nalgorithm is also a popular choice since, in the symmetric case, the rank\nstructure is preserved. In the unsymmetric case, however, QR algorithm destroys\nthe rank structure and, hence, LR-type algorithms come to play once again. In\nthe current paper we discover several variants of qd algorithms for\nquasiseparable matrices.

To allow integration over\nlong timescales, however, this balance must be precise; this is known as the\nfine tuning problem. The need for fine tuning can be overcome via a\nratchet-like mechanism, in which momentary inputs must be above a preset limit\nto be registered by the circuit. The degree of this ratcheting embodies a\ntradeoff between sensitivity to the input stream and robustness against\nparameter mistuning.\n  The goal of our study is to analyze the consequences of this tradeoff for\ndecision making performance. For concreteness, we focus on the well-studied\nrandom dot motion discrimination task. For stimulus parameters constrained by\nexperimental data, we find that loss of sensitivity to inputs has surprisingly\nlittle cost for decision performance. This leads robust integrators to\nperformance gains when feedback becomes mistuned. Moreover, we find that\nsubstantially robust and mistuned integrator models remain consistent with\nchronometric and accuracy functions found in experiments. We explain our\nfindings via sequential analysis of the momentary and integrated signals, and\ndiscuss their implication: robust integrators may be surprisingly well-suited\nto subserve the basic function of evidence integration in many cognitive tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 20:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-29"}

This principle is\nusually attributed to Leibniz, although the first recorded Western philosopher\nto use it was Anaximander of Miletus. The demand that nature be rational, in\nthe sense that it be compatible with the principle of sufficient reason,\nconflicts with a basic feature of contemporary orthodox physical theory, namely\nthe notion that nature's response to the probing action of an observer is\ndetermined by pure chance, and hence on the basis of absolutely no reason at\nall. This appeal to pure chance can be deemed to have no rational fundamental\nplace in reason-based Western science.

From the distribution of the \"virial\nproducts\" (~ FWHM_Hbeta^2 L_5100^0.5 or sigma_Hbeta^2 L_5100^0.5) measured from\nSE spectra, we estimate the uncertainty due to the combined variability as ~\n0.05 dex (12%). This is subdominant with respect to the total uncertainty in SE\nmass estimates, which is dominated by uncertainties in the size-luminosity\nrelation and virial coefficient, and is estimated to be ~ 0.46 dex (factor of ~\n3). By comparing the Hbeta line profile of the SE, mean, and root-mean-square\n(rms) spectra, we find that the Hbeta line is broader in the mean (and SE)\nspectra than in the rms spectra by ~ 0.1 dex (25%) for our sample with\nFWHM_Hbeta < 3000 km/s. This result is at variance with larger mass black holes\nwhere the difference is typically found to be much less than 0.1 dex. To\ncorrect for this systematic difference of the Hbeta line profile, we introduce\na line-width dependent virial factor, resulting in a recalibration of SE black\nhole mass estimators for low-mass AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 21:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This difference is\nusually reconciled by assuming that the galaxy formation efficiency drops\nsharply with decreasing halo mass, so that virtually no dwarf galaxies form in\nhalos less massive than ~ 10^10 M_sun. In turn, this implies that, at any given\nradius, the dark mass enclosed by a galaxy must exceed a certain minimum. We\nuse rotation curves of dwarf galaxies compiled from the literature to explore\nwhether their enclosed mass is consistent with these constraints. We find that\nalmost one half of the dwarfs in our sample with stellar mass between 10^6-10^7\nM_sun are at odds with this restriction: either they live in halos with masses\nsubstantially below 10^10 M_sun or there is a mechanism capable of reducing the\ndark mass enclosed by some of the faintest dwarfs. Neither possibility is\neasily accommodated within the standard LCDM scenario. Extending galaxy\nformation to halos well below 10^10 M_sun would lead to large numbers of dwarf\ngalaxies in excess of current estimates; at the same time, the extremely low\nstellar mass of the systems involved makes it unlikely that baryonic effects\ncan reduce their dark matter content. Resolving this challenge seems to require\nnew insights into dwarf galaxy formation, or perhaps a radical revision of the\nprevailing paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 21:06:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 18:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 20:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

One type of force-velocity curve, consisting of a concave\nregion where velocity is insensitive to increasing force followed by a decrease\nin velocity, is indicative of an adaptive response. In contrast, an engine\nwhose velocity rapidly decays as a convex curve in response to increasing force\nwould indicate a lack of adaptive response.

Here, we present Herschel PACS and SPIRE\nphotometry at 70-500um of the historical young supernova remnants: Kepler and\nTycho; both thought to be the remnants of Type Ia explosion events. We detect a\nwarm dust component in Kepler's remnant with T = 82K and mass 0.0031Msun; this\nis spatially coincident with thermal X-ray emission optical knots and\nfilaments, consistent with the warm dust originating in the circumstellar\nmaterial swept up by the primary blast wave of the remnant.

Comparing the\nspatial distribution of the warm dust with X-rays from the ejecta and swept-up\nmedium, and Ha emission arising from the post-shock edge, we show that the warm\ndust is swept up interstellar material. We find no evidence of a cool (25-50 K)\ncomponent of dust with mass >0.07Msun as observed in core-collapse remnants of\nmassive stars. Neither the warm or cold dust components detected here are\nspatially coincident with supernova ejecta material. We compare the lack of\nobserved supernova dust with a theoretical model of dust formation in Type Ia\nremnants which predicts dust masses of 0.088(0.017)Msun for ejecta expanding\ninto surrounding densities of 1(5)cm-3. The model predicts that silicon- and\ncarbon-rich dust grains will encounter the interior edge of the observed dust\nemission at 400 years confirming that the majority of the warm dust originates\nfrom swept up circumstellar or interstellar grains (for Kepler and Tycho\nrespectively). The lack of cold dust grains in the ejecta suggests that Type Ia\nremnants do not produce substantial quantities of iron-rich dust grains and has\nimportant consequences for the 'missing' iron mass observed in ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 21:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 12:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The functional\nform of the drag force as a function of the Mach number (V_0/c_s, where V_0 is\nthe velocity of the body and c_s the sound speed) depends on the strength of\nthe magnetic field and on the angle between the velocity of the perturber and\nthe direction of the magnetic field.

This\nunidirectional pinning leads to strongly history-dependent nodal line motion\nthat is strongly arrhythmogenic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 22:12:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 17:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-09"}

We present new\nmodifications of the optimal control algorithm that incorporate symmetry\nprinciples and relax conservative limits on peak RF pulse amplitude for short\ntime periods that pose no threat to the probe. We apply them to generate a set\nof pulses suitable for widespread use in Carbon-13 spectroscopy on the majority\nof available probes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 23:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Two different representative flow\ngeometries are chosen corresponding to those used previously by Butler &\nFarrell (1992) and Monokrousos et al. (2011). In the former (smaller geometry)\ncase as E_{0} increases from 0, we find an optimal which is a smooth nonlinear\ncontinuation of the well-known linear result at $E_{0} = 0$. At $E_{0} =\nE_{c}$, however, completely unrelated states are uncovered which trigger\nturbulence and our algorithm consequently fails to converge. As $E_{0}\n\\rightarrow E^{+}_{c}, we find good evidence that the turbulence triggering\ninitial conditions approach a 'minimal seed' which corresponds to the state of\nlowest energy on the laminar-turbulent basin boundary or 'edge'. This situation\nis repeated in the Monokrousos et al.

Numerical studies have been made in the past that investigate a\nrange of sources sizes and masses in the lens.

The jet half-opening angle start increasing logarithmically\nwith time once the Lorentz factor drops below 1/theta_0. For larger k values\nthe lateral expansion is faster at early times and slower at late times with\nthe jet expansion becoming Newtonian and slowly approaching spherical symmetry\nover progressively longer timescales. We find that contrary to analytic\nexpectations, there is a reasonably sharp jet break in the lightcurve for k = 2\nalthough the shape of the break is affected more by the viewing angle than by\nthe slope of the external density profile. Steeper density profiles are found\nto produce more gradual jet breaks while larger viewing angles cause smoother\nand later appearing jet breaks. The counter-jet becomes visible as it becomes\nsub-relativistic, and for k=0 this results in a clear bump-like feature in the\nlight curve. However, for larger k values the jet decelerates more gradually,\ncausing only a mild flattening in the radio light curve that might be hard to\ndiscern when k=2. Late time radio calorimetry is likely to consistently\nover-estimate the true energy by up to a factor of a few for k=2, and either\nover-predict or under-predict it by a smaller factor for k = 0,1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 01:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Our approach is\nbased on the observation that, the sensitivity of sorting, as a function on\nsets of real numbers, can be bounded.

To extend the mechanism to higher\ndimension, we employ locality preserving function to map the dataset to a\nbounded interval.

The model galaxy is\nemployed from an ultra-high-resolution chemodynamic simulation of a primordial\ngalaxy by Mori & Umemura, where the SFR is ~ 10 Msun/yr at t<0.3 Gyr and\nseveral Msun/yr at t>0.3 Gyr. The former phase well reproduces the observed\nproperties of LAEs and the latter does LBGs. We solve the three-dimensional\nradiative transfer in the clumpy interstellar media in this model galaxy,\ntaking the size distributions of dust grains into account, and calculate the\ndust temperature as a function of galactic evolutionary time. We find that the\nclumpiness of interstellar media plays an important role for the sub-millimeter\nbrightness. In the LAE phase, dust grains are concentrated on clumpy\nstar-forming regions that are distributed all over the galaxy, and the grains\ncan effectively absorb UV radiation from stars. As a result, the dust is heated\nup to T>35 K. In the LBG phase, the continuous supernovae drive dust grains far\naway from star-forming regions. Then, the grains cannot absorb much radiation\nfrom stars, and becomes into a cold state close to the CMB temperature.\nConsequently, the dust temperature decreases with the evolutionary time, where\nthe mass-weighted mean temperature is T=26 K at t=0.1 Gyr and T=21 K at t=1.0\nGyr. By this analysis, it turns out that the sub-millimeter brightness is\nhigher in the LAE phase than that in the LBG phase, although the dust-to-gas\nratio increases monotonically as a function of time. We derive the spectral\nenergy distributions by placing the model galaxy at a given redshift. The peak\nflux at 850 micron is found to be S_850 ~ 0.2 - 0.9 mJy if the model galaxy is\nplaced at 6>z>2.

Several groups have\ninvestigated the properties of LAEs using spectral energy distribution (SED)\nfitting, but direct comparison of their results is complicated by\ninconsistencies in the treatment of the data and in the assumptions made in\nmodeling the stellar populations, which are degenerate with the effects of\ngalaxy evolution. By using the same data analysis pipeline and SED fitting\nsoftware on two stacked samples of LAEs at z = 3.1 and z = 2.1, and by\neliminating several systematic uncertainties that might cause a discrepancy, we\ndetermine that the physical properties of these two samples of galaxies are\ndramatically different.

Given a set of positions for\nwireless nodes, the interference minimization problem is to assign a\ntransmission radius (equivalently, a power level) to each node such that the\nresulting communication graph is connected, while minimizing the maximum\ninterference. We consider the model introduced by von Rickenback et al. (2005),\nin which each transmission range is represented by a ball and edges in the\ncommunication graph are symmetric. The problem is NP-complete in two dimensions\n(Buchin 2008) and no polynomial-time approximation algorithm is known.\nFurthermore, even in one dimension (the highway model), the problem's\ncomplexity is unknown and the maximum interference of a set of n wireless nodes\ncan be as high as Theta(sqrt(n)) (von Rickenback et al. 2005). In this paper we\nshow how to solve the problem efficiently in settings typical for wireless ad\nhoc networks. In particular, we show that if node positions are represented by\na set P of n points selected uniformly and independently at random over a\nd-dimensional rectangular region, for any fixed d, then the topology given by\nthe closure of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of P has maximum\ninterference O(log n) with high probability. We extend this bound to a general\nclass of communication graphs over a broad set of probability distributions.\nNext we present a local algorithm that constructs a graph from this class; this\nis the first local algorithm to provide an upper bound on the expected maximum\ninterference.

We show\nthat near-IR (3 {\\mu}m)-mid- IR (11 {\\mu}m) color can be used as an indicator\nof the specific star formation rate and the presence of intermediate age\nstellar populations. From the MIR observations, we find that red-sequence\ngalaxies consist not only of passively evolving red early-type galaxies, but\nalso of 1) \"weak-SFG\" (disk-dominated star-forming galaxies which have star\nformation rates lower by \\sim 4 \\times than blue-cloud galaxies), and 2)\n\"intermediate- MXG\" (bulge-dominated galaxies showing stronger MIR dust\nemission than normal red early-type galaxies). Those two populations can be a\nset of transition galaxies from blue, star-forming, late-type galaxies evolving\ninto red, quiescent, early-type ones. We find that the weak-SFG are predominant\nat intermediate masses (1010M\\odot < M\\star < 1010.5M\\odot) and are typically\nfound in local densities similar to the outskirts of galaxy clusters.

Generally, the\nsoftware system architecture cannot follow the rapid evolution of a problem\ndomain which results in the discrepancies between the implemented and designed\narchitecture. Software architecture illustrates a system's structure and global\nproperties and consequently determines not only how the system should be\nconstructed but also leads its evolution. Architecture plays an important role\nto ensure that a system satisfies its business and mission goals during\nimplementation and evolution. However, the capabilities of the designed\narchitecture may possibly be lost when the implementation does not conform to\nthe designed architecture. Such a loss of consistency causes the risk of\narchitectural decay. The architectural decay can be avoided if architectural\nchanges are made as early as possible.

This conclusion, mainly based in the observation of new\nanomalies in the low-field isothermal magnetization curves, is in contradiction\nwith our earlier results in the underdoped La(1.9)Sr(0.1)CuO(4) [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 84, 3157 (2000)]. These seemingly intrinsic anomalies are being presented\nin various influential works as a 'thermodynamic evidence' for phase incoherent\nsuperconductivity in the pseudogap regime, this last being at present a central\nand debated issue of the cuprate superconductors' physics. Here we have\nextended our magnetization measurements in La(1.9)Sr(0.1)CuO(4) to two samples\nwith different chemical disorder, in one of them close to the one associated\nwith the random distribution of Sr ions. For this sample, the corresponding\nTc-distribution may be approximated as symmetric around the average Tc, while\nin the most disordered sample is strongly asymmetric. The comparison between\nthe magnetization measured in both samples provides a crucial check of the\nchemical disorder origin of the observed diamagnetism anomalies, which are\nsimilar to those claimed as due to phase fluctuations by other authors. This\nconclusion applies also to the sample affected only by the intrinsic-like\nchemical disorder, providing then a further check that the intrinsic\ndiamagnetism above the superconducting transition of underdoped cuprates is not\naffected by the opening of a pseudogap in the normal state. It is also shown\nhere that once these disorder effects are overcome, the remaining precursor\ndiamagnetism may be accounted at a quantitative level in terms of the GGL\napproach under a total energy cutoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 10:47:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 12:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This is the first time bright HCN, HCO+ and HNC emission has been\ndetected in a large-scale galactic outflow. We find that both the blue- and\nred-shifted line wings are spatially extended by at least 0.\"75 (700 pc) in a\nnorth-south direction. The line wings are brighter (relative to the line center\nintensity) in HCN than in CO 1-0 and line ratios suggest that the molecular\noutflow consists of dense (n>10E4 cmE-3) and clumpy gas with a high HCN\nabundance X(HCN)>10E-8. These properties are consistent with the molecular gas\nbeing compressed and fragmented by shocks in the outflow. Alternatively, HCN is\ninstead pumped by mid-IR continuum, but we propose that this effect is not\nstrong for the spatially extended outflowing gas. In addition, we find that the\nrotation of the main disk, in east-west direction, is also evident in the HCN,\nHCO+ and HNC line emission.

We wish\nto expand the sample of extreme starbursts, represented by local LIRGs and\nULIRGs, with high quality observations in the 1-0 line of HCN. We study if a\nuniversal law can account for the star formation relations observed for the\ndense molecular gas in normal star forming galaxies and extreme starbursts. We\nhave used the IRAM 30m telescope to observe a sample of 19 LIRGs in the 1-0\nlines of CO, HCN and HCO+. The analysis of the new data proves that the\nefficiency of star formation in the dense molecular gas (SFE-dense) of extreme\nstarbursts is a factor 3-4 higher compared to normal galaxies. We find a\nduality in Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws that is reinforced if we account for the\ndifferent conversion factor for HCN (alpha-HCN) in extreme starbursts and for\nthe unobscured star formation rate in normal galaxies. This result extends to\nthe higher molecular densities probed by HCN lines the more extreme bimodal\nbehavior of star formation laws, derived from CO molecular lines by two recent\nsurveys. We have confronted our observations with the predictions of\ntheoretical models in which the efficiency of star formation is determined by\nthe ratio of a constant star formation rate per free-fall time (SFR-ff) to the\nlocal free-fall time. We find that it is possible to fit the observed\ndifferences in the SFE-dense between normal galaxies and LIRGs/ULIRGs using a\ncommon constant SFR-ff and a set of physically acceptable HCN densities, but\nonly if SFR-ff~0.005-0.01 and/or if alpha-HCN is a factor of a few lower than\nour favored values. Star formation recipes that explicitly depend on the galaxy\nglobal dynamical time scales do not significantly improve the fit to the new\nHCN data presented in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 11:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The shear viscosity of the suspensions\nis measured using a wide-gap Couette rheometer equipped with a Particle Image\nVelocimetry (PIV) device that allows measuring the velocity field. The\nsuspensions made of PMMA particles (31$\\mu$m in diameter) suspended in a\nNewtonian index- and density-matched liquid are transparent enough to allow an\naccurate measurement of the local velocity for particle concentrations as high\nas 50%. In the wide-gap Couette cell, the shear induced particle migration is\nevidenced by the measurement of the time evolution of the flow profile. A\npeculiar radial zone in the gap is identified where the viscosity remains\nconstant. At this special location, the local particle volume fraction is taken\nto be the mean particle concentration. The local shear transient response of\nthe suspensions when the shear flow is reversed is measured at this point where\nthe particle volume fraction is well defined. The local rheological\nmeasurements presented here confirm the macroscopic measurements of\nGadala-Maria and Acrivos (1980). After shear reversal, the viscosity undergoes\na step-like reduction, decreases slower and passes through a minimum before\nincreasing again to reach a plateau. Upon varying the particle concentration,\nwe have been able to show that the minimum and the plateau viscosities do not\nobey the same scaling law with respect to the particle volume fraction. These\nexperimental results are consistent with the scaling predicted by Mills and\nSnabre (2009) and with the results of numerical simulation performed on random\nsuspensions [Sierou and Brady (2001)]. The minimum seems to be associated with\nthe viscosity of an isotropic suspension, or at least of a suspension whose\nparticles do not interact through non-hydrodynamic forces, while the plateau\nvalue would correspond to the viscosity of a suspension structured by the shear\nwhere the non-hydrodynamic forces play a crucial role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 12:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We model the chemistry of the inner wind of the carbon star IRC+10216\nand consider the effect of periodic shocks induced by the stellar pulsation on\nthe gas to follow the non-equilibrium chemistry in the shocked gas layers.

The shocks induce a non-equilibrium chemistry in the dust\nformation zone of IRC+10216 where the collision destruction of CO in the\npost-shock gas triggers the formation of O-bearing species (H2O, SiO). Most of\nthe modelled abundances agree very well with the latest values derived from\nHerschel data on IRC+10216. Hydrides form a family of abundant species that are\nexpelled into the intermediate envelope. In particular, HF traps all the atomic\nfluorine in the dust formation zone.

Therefore, HCl and other\nCl-bearing species should also be present in the inner wind of O-rich AGB or\nsupergiant stars.

In the eyes of\nnearly all experimentalists, any suchlike bump is a true resonance as soon as\nits statistical significance exceeds certain minimal values. However, this\nsimple point of view ignores possible effects from competing hadronic channels\nand the opening of the corresponding thresholds. On the other hand, most\ntheoretical hadron-model builders consider mesons merely bound states of a\nquark and an antiquark, or of more exotic combinations sometimes involving\nvalence gluons as well. Also the latter description is much too naive, since\nconsiderable mass shifts or even the dynamical generation of extra states due\nto unquenching are equally ignored.\n  In the present paper, a largely empirical yet very successful approach to\nmeson spectroscopy is revisited, in which all the above phenomena can be\naccounted for non-perturbatively, with concrete examples of some enigmatic\nmesonic states described in detail. First, the X(4260) charmonium enhancement\nis argued to be a non-resonant structure resulting from depletion effects due\nto competing channels and resonances. Then, the X(3872) charmonium-like meson\nis described as a unitarised $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $c\\bar{c}$ state.

To this aim, we have developed an algorithm solving the\nradiative transfer equation in the Fokker-Planck approximation when both\nthermal and bulk Comptonization take place. The algorithm is essentially a\nrelaxation method, where stable solutions are obtained when the system has\nreached its steady-state equilibrium. We obtained the solution of the radiative\ntransfer equation in the two-dimensional domain defined by the photon energy E\nand optical depth of the system tau using finite-differences for the partial\nderivatives, and imposing specific boundary conditions for the solutions. We\ntreated the case of cylindrical accretion onto a magnetized neutron star. We\nconsidered a blackbody seed spectrum of photons with exponential distribution\nacross the accretion column and for an accretion where the velocity reaches its\nmaximum at the stellar surface and at the top of the accretion column,\nrespectively. In both cases higher values of the electron temperature and of\nthe optical depth tau produce flatter and harder spectra. Other parameters\ncontributing to the spectral formation are the steepness of the vertical\nvelocity profile, the albedo at the star surface, and the radius of the\naccretion column. The latter parameter modifies the emerging spectra in a\nspecular way for the two assumed accretion profiles. The algorithm has been\nimplemented in the XSPEC package for X-ray spectral fitting and is specifically\ndedicated to the physical framework of accretion at the polar cap of a neutron\nstar with a high magnetic field (> 10^{12} G), which is expected to be typical\nof accreting systems such as X-ray pulsars and supergiant fast X-ray\ntransients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 15:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-11"}

In Newtonian hydrodynamics, e.g., there are indeed usually three\nfree parameters, $N_f = 3$. If, however, the dynamical equations contain a\nuniversal dimensional constant, such as the speed of light in vacuum $c$ or the\ngravitational constant $G$, then the requirement that its value remains the\nsame imposes a constraint on the rescaling, which reduces its number of free\nparameters by one, to $N_f = 2$. This is the case, for example, in\nmagneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) or special relativistic hydrodynamics, where $c$\nappears in the dynamical equations and forces the length and time units to\nscale by the same factor, or in Newtonian gravity where the gravitational\nconstant $G$ appears in the equations. More generally, when there are $N_{udc}$\nindependent (in terms of their units) universal dimensional constants, then the\nnumber of free parameters is $N_f = max(0,3-N_{udc})$.

Financial operations are a case in point where spreadsheets fill the\ngaps left by dedicated accounting systems, particularly covering reporting and\nbusiness process operations. However, little is understood as to the nature of\nspreadsheet usage in organisations and the contents and structure of these\nspreadsheets as they relate to key business functions with few, if any,\ncomprehensive analyses of spreadsheet repositories in real organisations. As\nsuch this paper represents an important attempt at profiling real and\nsubstantial spreadsheet repositories.\n  Using the Luminous technology an analysis of 65,000 spreadsheets for the\nfinancial departments of both a government and a private commercial\norganisation was conducted. This provides an important insight into the nature\nand structure of these spreadsheets, the links between them, the existence and\nnature of macros and the level of repetitive processes performed through the\nspreadsheets. Furthermore it highlights the organisational dependence on\nspreadsheets and the range and number of spreadsheets dealt with by individuals\non a daily basis. In so doing, this paper prompts important questions that can\nframe future research in the domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 15:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-30"}

Yet, until very recently, most such attempts were underpinned by\nresearch which predominantly regarded linguistic phenomena as separated from\nthe brain and body. This could lead one into believing that to emulate\nlinguistic behaviour, it suffices to develop 'software' operating on abstract\nrepresentations that will work on any computational machine. This picture is\ninaccurate for several reasons, which are elucidated in this paper and extend\nbeyond sensorimotor and semantic resonance. Beginning with a review of\nresearch, I list several heterogeneous arguments against disembodied language,\nin an attempt to draw conclusions for developing embodied multisensory agents\nwhich communicate verbally and non-verbally with their environment. Without\ntaking into account both the architecture of the human brain, and embodiment,\nit is unrealistic to replicate accurately the processes which take place during\nlanguage acquisition, comprehension, production, or during non-linguistic\nactions. While robots are far from isomorphic with humans, they could benefit\nfrom strengthened associative connections in the optimization of their\nprocesses and their reactivity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and in\nsituated human-machine interaction. The concept of multisensory integration\nshould be extended to cover linguistic input and the complementary information\ncombined from temporally coincident sensory impressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 15:30:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 12:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 16:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-23"}

For objects engaged in classical\nnon-relativistic velocities, this leads under asymmetric conditions to\nacceleration processes that resemble the behavior of objects subject to\nNewton's second law, and in three dimensional space, acceleration dependent on\nan inverse square law emerges. Thus, a non-relativistic random walk would\nappear to be capable of describing certain prominent features of classical\nphysics; however, this classical behavior appears to be able to take place only\nfor objects with mass exceeding a threshold value which we identify with the\nPlanck mass. Under these circumstances, stochastic space-time displacements\nwould be smaller than the Planck length and the Planck time so that such\nclassically behaved objects would be effectively localized. Lower mass objects\nexhibit more rapid diffusion and less localization, and a relativistic random\nwalk would seem to be required of objects having masses comparable to and\nsmaller than the threshold mass value.
