Second order accuracy for the first derivative is obtained as well.\nThe method is based on the Ghost Fluid Method, making use of ghost points on\nwhich the value is defined by suitable interface conditions. The multi-domain\nformulation is adopted, where the problem is split in two sub-problems and\ninterface conditions will be enforced to close the problem. Interface\nconditions are relaxed together with the internal equations, leading to an\niterative method on all the set of grid values (inside points and ghost\npoints). A multigrid approach with a suitable definition of the restriction\noperator is provided. The restriction of the defect is performed separately for\nboth sub-problems, providing a convergence factor close to the one measured in\nthe case of smooth coefficient and independent on the magnitude of the jump in\nthe coefficient. Numerical tests will confirm the second order accuracy.\nAlthough the method is proposed in one dimension, the extension in higher\ndimension is currently underway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 16:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-07"}

Indeed, not even a clear dividing line between massive\nplanets and brown dwarfs has been established yet. This is partly due to the\npaucity of this kind of objects orbiting close to solar-type stars, the\nso-called brown dwarf desert, that hinders setting up a strong observational\nbase to compare to models and theories of formation and evolution.\n  We search to increase the current sample of massive sub-stellar objects with\nprecise orbital parameters, and to constrain the true mass of detected\nsub-stellar candidates.\n  The initial identification of sub-stellar candidates is done using precise\nradial velocity measurements obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the\n1.93-m telescope of the Haute-Provence Observatory. Subsequent characterisation\nof these candidates, with the principal aim of identifying stellar companions\nin low-inclination orbits, is done by means of different spectroscopic\ndiagnostics, as the measurement of the bisector velocity span and the study of\nthe correlation mask effect. With this objective, we also employed astrometric\ndata from the Hipparcos mission and a novel method of simulating stellar\ncross-correlation functions.\n  Seven new objects with minimum masses between ~ 10 Mjup and ~90 Mjup are\ndetected. Out of these, two are identified as low-mass stars in low-inclination\norbits, and two others have masses below the theoretical deuterium-burning\nlimit, and are therefore planetary candidates. The remaining three are brown\ndwarf candidates; the current upper limits for their the masses do not allow us\nto conclude on their nature. Additionally, we have improved on the parameters\nof an already-known brown dwarf (HD137510b), confirmed by astrometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 16:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-13"}

The steady decline in X-ray\nluminosity over 1.5 months gives an observed e-fold timescale of ~40 days;\nsimilar to the decay timescales seen in soft X-ray transients in our own\nGalaxy. This supports the interpretation of this ULX as a stellar mass black\nhole in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), accreting at super Eddington rates.\nThis is further supported by the lack of detection of an O/B star in quiescence\nand the XMM-Newton spectral data being dominated by a disc-like component\nrather than the power-law expected from a sub-Eddington intermediate-mass black\nhole.\n  These data give the best sequence of high Eddington fraction spectra ever\nassembled due to the combination of low absorption column to M31 and well\ncalibrated bandpass down to 0.3 keV of XMM-Newton. The spectra can be roughly\ndescribed by our best current disc model, BHSPEC, assuming a 10 M_solar black\nhole with best fit spin of ~0.4. However, the data are better described by a\ntwo component model, where the disc emission is significantly affected by\nadvection, and with an additional low temperature Comptonisation component at\nhigh energies. This could simply indicate the limitations of current disc\nmodels, though the energy-dependent variability also weakly supports a two\ncomponent interpretation of the data.\n  Irrespective of the detailed interpretation of the spectral properties, these\ndata support the presence of accretion onto a stellar mass black hole in a LMXB\naccreting in the Eddington-regime. This allows an unambiguous connection of\nthis object, and, by extension, similar low luminosity ULXs, to `standard'\nX-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 17:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Under an average only total transmit power constraint\n(APC), large antenna arrays at the BS (having tens to a few hundred antennas)\nhave been recently shown to achieve remarkable multi-user interference (MUI)\nsuppression with simple precoding techniques. However, building large arrays in\npractice, would require cheap/power-efficient Radio-Frequency(RF) electronic\ncomponents. The type of transmitted signal that facilitates the use of most\npower-efficient RF components is a constant envelope (CE) signal. Under certain\nmild channel conditions (including i.i.d. fading), we analytically show that,\neven under the stringent per-antenna CE transmission constraint (compared to\nAPC), MUI suppression can still be achieved with large antenna arrays. Our\nanalysis also reveals that, with a fixed M and increasing N, the total\ntransmitted power can be reduced while maintaining a constant\nsignal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) level at each user. We also propose a\nnovel low-complexity CE precoding scheme, using which, we confirm our\nanalytical observations for the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel, through\nMonte-Carlo simulations. Simulation of the information sum-rate under the\nper-antenna CE constraint, shows that, for a fixed M and a fixed desired\nsum-rate, the required total transmit power decreases linearly with increasing\nN, i.e., an O(N) array power gain. Also, in terms of the total transmit power\nrequired to achieve a fixed desired information sum-rate, despite the stringent\nper-antenna CE constraint, the proposed CE precoding scheme performs close to\nthe GBC sum-capacity (under APC) achieving scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 17:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-07"}

Besides composite spectra, we also compute the first five principal\ncomponents of the distributions in each galaxy class to characterize the nature\nof variations of individual spectra around the averages.

Our treatment is made in the realm of\nnon-axisymmetric Robinson-Trautman spacetimes which are appropriate for the\ndescription of the system. Characteristic initial data for the system are\nconstructed and the Robinson-Trautman equation is integrated using a numerical\ncode based on the Galerkin spectral method. The collision is planar, restricted\nto the plane determined by the directions of the two initial colliding black\nholes, with the net momentum fluxes of gravitational waves confined to this\nplane. We evaluate the efficiency of mass-energy extraction, the total energy\nand momentum carried out by gravitational waves and the momentum distribution\nof the remnant black hole. Our analysis is based on the Bondi-Sachs four\nmomentum conservation laws. Head-on collisions and orthogonal collisions\nconstitute, respectively, upper and lower bounds to the power emission and to\nthe efficiency of mass-energy extraction by gravitational waves. The momentum\nextraction and the pattern of the momentum fluxes, as a function of the\nincidence angle, are examined. The momentum extraction characterizes a regime\nof strong deceleration of the system. The angular pattern of gravitational wave\nsignals is also examined. They are typically bremsstrahlung for early times\nemission. Gravitational waves are also emitted outside the plane of collision\nbut this component has a zero net momentum flux. The relation between the\nincidence angle of collision and the exit angle of the remnant closely\napproximates a relation for inelastic collisions of classical particles in\nNewtonian dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 19:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 15:41:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 17:18:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 19:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Sudden misalignments can\nsometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightly\noff-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smooth\nand trace only global gravitational instabilities. When several nested,\nself-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble in\nthe potential of the outer modes.

Instead of\nimposing R-parity we apply the minimal flavor violation (MFV) hypothesis to the\nR-parity violating MSSM. In this framework, which we call MFV SUSY, squarks can\nbe light and the proton long lived without producing missing energy signals at\nthe LHC. Our approach differs from that of Nikolidakis and Smith in that we\nimpose holomorphy on the MFV spurions. The resulting model is highly\nconstrained and R-parity emerges as an accidental approximate symmetry of the\nlow-energy Lagrangian. The size of the small R-parity violating terms is\ndetermined by the flavor parameters, and in the absence of neutrino masses\nthere is only one renormalizable R-parity violating interaction: the\nbaryon-number violating $\\bar{u}\\bar{d}\\bar{d}$ superpotential term. Low energy\nobservables (proton decay, dinucleon decay and $n-\\bar{n}$ oscillation) pose\nonly mild constraints on the parameter space. LHC phenomenology will depend on\nwhether the LSP is a squark, neutralino, chargino or slepton.

This approach is well\nsuited for analysing stars for which the stellar rotation period is not known,\nand therefore the rotational phases of the observations are ambiguous. The\nmodel assumes that the magnetic observations correspond to a dipole oblique\nrotator, a situation commonly encountered in intermediate and high-mass stars.\nUsing reasonable assumptions regarding the model parameter prior probability\ndensity distributions, the Bayesian algorithm determines the posterior\nprobability densities corresponding to the surface magnetic field geometry and\nstrength by performing a comparison between the observed and computed Stokes V\nprofiles.\n  Based on the results of numerical simulations, we conclude that this method\nyields a useful estimate of the surface dipole field strength based on a small\nnumber (i.e. 1 or 2) of observations. On the other hand, the method provides\nonly weak constraints on the dipole geometry. The odds ratio, a parameter\ncomputed by the algorithm that quantifies the relative appropriateness of the\nmagnetic dipole model versus the non-magnetic model, provides a more sensitive\ndiagnostic of the presence of weak magnetic signals embedded in noise than\ntraditional techniques.\n  To illustrate the application of the technique to real data, we analyse seven\nESPaDOnS and Narval observations of the early B-type magnetic star LP Ori.\nInsufficient information is available to determine the rotational period of the\nstar and therefore the phase of the data; hence traditional modelling\ntechniques fail to infer the dipole strength. In contrast, the Bayesian method\nallows a robust determination of the dipole polar strength,\n$B_d=911^{+138}_{-244}$ G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 20:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To account for the phase alignment, we\nexplore geometric models where both the radio and gamma-ray emission originate\neither in the outer magnetosphere near the light cylinder (R_LC) or near the\npolar caps (PCs). We obtain reasonable fits for the first three of these MSPs\nin the context of \"altitude-limited\" outer gap (alOG) and two-pole caustic\n(alTPC) geometries. The outer magnetosphere phase-aligned models differ from\nthe standard outer gap (OG) / two-pole caustic (TPC) models in two respects:\nfirst, the radio emission originates in caustics at relatively high altitudes\ncompared to the usual low-altitude conal radio beams; second, we allow the\nmaximum altitude of the gamma-ray emission region as well as both the minimum\nand maximum altitudes of the radio emission region to vary within a limited\nrange. Alternatively, there also exist phase-aligned LC solutions for emission\noriginating near the stellar surface in a slot gap (SG) scenario (\"low-altitude\nslot gap\" (laSG) models). We find best-fit LCs using a Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) maximum likelihood approach. Our fits imply that the phase-aligned LCs\nare likely of caustic origin, produced in the outer magnetosphere, and that the\nradio emission may come from close to R_LC.

The control landscape can be shown to contain no suboptimal trapping\nextrema upon satisfaction of reasonable physical assumptions, but this\ntopological analysis does not hold when significant constraints are placed on\nthe control resources. This work employs simulations to explore the topology\nand features of the control landscape for pure-state population transfer with a\nconstrained class of control fields. The fields are parameterized in terms of a\nset of uniformly spaced spectral frequencies, with the associated phases acting\nas the controls. Optimization results reveal that the minimum number of phase\ncontrols necessary to assure a high yield in the target state has a special\ndependence on the number of accessible energy levels in the quantum system,\nrevealed from an analysis of the first- and second-order variation of the yield\nwith respect to the controls. When an insufficient number of controls and/or a\nweak control fluence are employed, trapping extrema and saddle points are\nobserved on the landscape. When the control resources are sufficiently\nflexible, solutions producing the globally maximal yield are found to form\nconnected `level sets' of continuously variable control fields that preserve\nthe yield. These optimal yield level sets are found to shrink to isolated\npoints on the top of the landscape as the control field fluence is decreased,\nand further reduction of the fluence turns these points into suboptimal\ntrapping extrema on the landscape. Although constrained control fields can come\nin many forms beyond the cases explored here, the behavior found in this paper\nis illustrative of the impacts that constraints can introduce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 22:55:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 18:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

For all these reasons, a fundamental problem in\ninformation theory is to assess the (classical or quantum) dimension of a\nphysical system in a \"device-independent\" scenario, i.e., without referring to\nthe system's specifications, which may be under control of a dishonest\nsupplier, eavesdropper or saboteur. In this contribution we report experiments\nrealizing this goal for systems emitted by a black box. Our results indicate\nthat dimension witnesses utilized in the experiments may become a powerful tool\nfor testing systems provided by unreliable sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2011 01:38:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 22:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-16"}

Their spectral\nproperties and energetics are consistent with cumulative emission from a\npopulation of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) hosted by these clusters. For example,\nthe HE spectra exhibit fairly hard power-law indices and cutoffs around a few\nGeV, typical of pulsed spectra measured for the gamma-ray pulsar population.\nThe energetics may be used to constrain the number of visible MSPs in the\ncluster (N_vis), assuming canonical values for the average gamma-ray efficiency\nand spin-down power. This interpretation is indeed strengthened by the fact\nthat the first gamma-ray MSP has now been identified in the GC NGC 6624, and\nthis MSP is responsible for almost all of the HE emission from this cluster. On\nthe other hand, it has been argued that the MSPs are also sources of\nrelativistic leptons which may be reaccelerated in shocks originating in\ncollisions of stellar winds in the cluster core, and may upscatter bright\nstarlight and cosmic microwave background photons to very high energies.\nTherefore, this unpulsed component may give an independent constraint on the\ntotal number of MSPs (N_tot) hosted in the GC, for a given cluster magnetic\nfield B and diffusion coefficient k_0. Lastly, the transport properties of the\nenergetic leptons may be further constrained using multiwavelength data, e.g.,\nto infer the radial dependence of k_0 and B.

To eliminate the\nneed for manual tuning and maintenance demanded by that first prototype, a new\nsetup with fully automatic calibration was designed recently. The key element\nof the new circuit is a novel, continuously variable analog delay line that\nenables the temporal equalization of the signals from the camera photo sensors,\nwhich is crucial for the efficient detection of low-energy showers. A further\nimprovement is the much larger trigger area consisting of a fully revised\nconfiguration of overlapping summing patches.

For\nexample, in astrophysics, periodic variable stars play a pivotal role in\nunderstanding our universe. An important step when analyzing data from such\nprocesses is the problem of identifying the period: estimating the period of a\nperiodic function based on noisy observations made at irregularly spaced time\npoints. This problem is still a difficult challenge despite extensive study in\ndifferent disciplines. The paper makes several contributions toward solving\nthis problem. First, we present a nonparametric Bayesian model for period\nfinding, based on Gaussian Processes (GP), that does not make strong\nassumptions on the shape of the periodic function. As our experiments\ndemonstrate, the new model leads to significantly better results in period\nestimation when the target function is non-sinusoidal. Second, we develop a new\nalgorithm for parameter optimization for GP which is useful when the likelihood\nfunction is very sensitive to the setting of the hyper-parameters with numerous\nlocal minima, as in the case of period estimation. The algorithm combines\ngradient optimization with grid search and incorporates several mechanisms to\novercome the high complexity of inference with GP. Third, we develop a novel\napproach for using domain knowledge, in the form of a probabilistic generative\nmodel, and incorporate it into the period estimation algorithm.

We work within the first-order\nframework, and we show how to write first-order differential equations that\nsolve the equations of motion. The first-order equations strongly simplify the\nstudy of linear stability, which is implemented on general grounds. They also\nlead to a direct investigation of twinlike theories, which is used to introduce\na family of models that support the same defect structure, with the very same\nenergy density and linear stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2011 14:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

The\neffective magnetic-field acting on the phonons naturally emerges, giving rise\nto the phonon Hall effect. A general formula of the intrinsic phonon Hall\nconductivity is obtained by using the corrected Kubo formula with the energy\nmagnetization contribution incorporated properly. The resulting phonon Hall\nconductivity is fully determined by the phonon Berry curvature and the\ndispersions. Based on the formula, the topological phonon system could be\nrigorously defined. In the low temperature regime, we predict that the phonon\nHall conductivity is proportional to $T^{3}$ for the ordinary phonon systems,\nwhile that for the topological phonon systems has the linear $T$ dependence\nwith the quantized temperature coefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2011 15:53:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 15:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 14:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-14"}

The observations are primarily from HARPS\nspectra obtained at a single epoch. We accept arguments that the presence of\nnumerous emission lines does not vitiate a classical abundance analysis, though\nit likely reduces the achievable accuracy. Most abundances are closely solar,\nbut several elements show departures of a factor of two to three, as an earlier\nstudy has also shown. We present quantitative measurements of more than 60\nemission lines, peak intensities, equivalent widths, and FWHM's. The latter\nrange from over 200 km/s (H-alpha, He D3) down to 10--20 km/s (forbidden\nlines). Metallic emission lines have intermediate widths. We eschew modeling,\nand content ourselves with a presentation of the observations a successful\nmodel must explain. Low-excitation features such as the Na I D-lines and [O I]\nappear with He I D3, suggesting proximate regions with widely differing Te and\nNe as found in the solar chromosphere. The [O I] and [Ca II] lines show sharp,\nviolet-shifted features. Additionally, [Fe II] lines appear to be weakly\npresent in emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2011 15:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
