Based on arguments from statistical\nphysics, we conjecture that the threshold d_k for permuted k-colorability in\nrandom graphs G(n,m=dn/2), where the permutations on the edges are uniformly\nrandom, is equal to the threshold for standard graph k-colorability. The\nadditional symmetry provided by random permutations makes it easier to prove\nbounds on d_k.

The parameterization of the problem is done in terms of the SOI\ncoupling constants and of the phase difference between the two laser\ncomponents.

In order to\ndetermine learning impairment and brain functional alterations in this model,\nwe assessed reversal learning and neural metabolic activity in a PCS rat model.\nPortacaval shunt and sham-operated rats were tested for reversal learning in\nthe Morris water maze. Brains were processed for cytochrome oxidase\nhistochemistry. The portacaval shunt group presents reversal learning\nimpairment and cytochrome oxidase activity reduction in prefrontal cortex,\nventral tegmental area and accumbens shell nucleus. These results suggest that\nthis model of portosystemic hepatic encephalopathy shows learning impairment\nthat could be linked to dysfunction in neural activity in the prefrontal cortex\nand regions involved in motivated behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2011 19:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

These series\narise as coefficients in the R4 and D4R4 interactions in the low energy\nexpansion of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric string theory\nreduced to D=10-d dimensions on a torus T^d, d<8. For each d these amplitudes\nare automorphic functions on the rank d+1 symmetry group E_d+1. Of particular\nsignificance is the orbit content of the Fourier modes of these series when\nexpanded in three different parabolic subgroups, corresponding to certain\nlimits of string theory. This is of interest in the classification of a variety\nof instantons that correspond to minimal or next-to-minimal BPS orbits. In the\nlimit of decompactification from D to D+1 dimensions many such instantons are\nrelated to charged 1/2-BPS or 1/4-BPS black holes with euclidean world-lines\nwrapped around the large dimension. In a different limit the instantons give\nnonperturbative corrections to string perturbation theory, while in a third\nlimit they describe nonperturbative contributions in eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity. A proof is given that these three distinct Fourier expansions\nhave certain vanishing coefficients that are expected from string theory. In\nparticular, the Eisenstein series for these special values of s have markedly\nfewer Fourier coefficients than typical ones. The corresponding mathematics\ninvolves showing that the wavefront sets of the Eisenstein series are supported\non only certain coadjoint nilpotent orbits - just the minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/2-BPS case, and just the next-to-minimal, minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/4-BPS case. Thus as a byproduct we demonstrate that the\nnext-to-minimal representations occur automorphically for E6, E7, and E8, and\nhence the first two nontrivial low energy coefficients are exotic\ntheta-functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2011 02:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 15:05:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 15:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

We show that non-specific\nTF binding affinity is universally controlled by the strength and symmetry of\nDNA sequence correlations. We perform correlation analysis of the yeast genome\nand show that DNA regions highly occupied by TFs exhibit stronger\nhomo-oligonucleotide sequence correlations, and thus higher propensity for\nnon-specific binding, as compared with poorly occupied regions. We suggest that\nthis effect plays the role of an effective localization potential enhancing the\nquasi-one-dimensional diffusion of TFs in the vicinity of DNA, speeding up the\nstochastic search process for specific TF binding sites. The predicted effect\nalso imposes an upper bound on the size of TF-DNA binding motifs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2011 09:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

We apply quantitative approaches to information flow in the\nfirst two cases, and we propose improvements for the usual solutions based on\nprocess equivalences for the third case. In the first scenario we consider the\nproblem of defining the information leakage in interactive systems where\nsecrets and observables can alternate during the computation and influence each\nother. We show that the information-theoretic approach which interprets such\nsystems as (simple) noisy channels is not valid. The principle can be recovered\nif we consider channels with memory and feedback. We also propose the use of\ndirected information from input to output as the real measure of leakage in\ninteractive systems. In the second scenario we consider the problem of\nstatistical disclosure control, which concerns how to reveal accurate\nstatistics about a set of respondents while preserving the privacy of\nindividuals. We focus on the concept of differential privacy, a notion that has\nbecome very popular in the database community. We show how to model the query\nsystem in terms of an information-theoretic channel, and we compare the notion\nof differential privacy with that of min-entropy leakage.In the third scenario\nwe address the problem of using process equivalences to characterize\ninformation-hiding properties. We show that, in the presence of nondeterminism,\nthis approach may rely on the assumption that the scheduler \"works for the\nbenefit of the protocol\", and this is often not a safe assumption.

Here we obtain explicitly the Fokker-Planck equation, the\nmean square displacement and the relaxation function. This model includes\nsubdiffusion as a particular case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2011 14:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

In considering an Io-like body on a low\neccentricity orbit, we describe the different possible behaviors of the system,\ndepending on the size, polar flattening and shape of the core.\n  We use for that the numerical tool. We propagate numerically the Hamilton\nequations of the systems, before expressing the resulting variables under a\nquasi-periodic representation. This expression is obtained numerically by\nfrequency analysis. This allows us to characterize the equilibria of the\nsystem, and to distinguish the causes of their time variations.\n  We show that, even without orbital eccentricity, the system can have complex\nbehaviors, in particular when the core is highly flattened. In such a case, the\npolar motion is forced by several degrees and longitudinal librations appear.\nThis is due to splitting of the equilibrium position of the polar motion. We\nalso get a shift of the obliquity when the polar flattening of the core is\nsmall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2011 14:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

In particular, we obtain the localization theorems in\nthe case of seminormal and $F$-rational rings, respectively. Another aspect of\nthis problem is global, which is often related to the vanishing problem of\ncertain higher direct image sheaves. As a test example, we consider the\ndeformation of the global $F$-regularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2011 15:07:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2013 15:19:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 19:55:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 06:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

Though sliding windows are widely\nused to facilitate effective event stream processing, it is greatly challenged\nwhen the event sources are distributed and asynchronous. To address this\nchallenge, we first show that the snapshots of the asynchronous event streams\nwithin the sliding window form a convex distributive lattice (denoted by\nLat-Win). Then we propose an algorithm to maintain Lat-Win at runtime. The\nLat-Win maintenance algorithm is implemented and evaluated on the open-source\ncontext-aware middleware we developed. The evaluation results first show the\nnecessity of adopting sliding windows over asynchronous event streams. Then\nthey show the performance of detecting specified predicates within Lat-Win,\neven when faced with dynamic changes in the computing environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2011 15:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}
