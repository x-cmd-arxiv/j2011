We make the natural extension of this\naxiomatization to the case of finite index subfactors of arbitrary type. We\nalso provide the first steps toward a limited planar structure in the infinite\nindex case. The central role of rotations, which provide the main non-trivial\npart of the planar structure, is a recurring theme throughout this work. In the\nfinite index case the axioms of a $C^*$-planar algebra need to be weakened to\ndisallow rotation of internal discs, giving rise to the notion of a rigid\n$C^*$-planar algebra. We show that the standard invariant of any finite index\nsubfactor has a rigid $C^*$-planar algebra structure.

Important issues are not only\nthe existence of stochastic similarity, but also whether a similarity solution\nis dynamically attractive, and if it is, to what particular solution does the\nsystem evolve. By recasting a class of stochastic PDEs in a form to which\nstochastic centre manifold theory may be applied we resolve these issues in\nthis class. For definiteness, a first example of self-similarity of the\nBurgers' equation driven by some stochastic forced is studied. Under suitable\nassumptions, a stationary solution is constructed which yields the existence of\na stochastic self-similar solution for the stochastic Burgers' equation.\nFurthermore, the asymptotic convergence to the self-similar solution is proved.\nSecond, in more general stochastic reaction-diffusion systems stochastic centre\nmanifold theory provides a framework to construct the similarity solution,\nconfirm its relevance, and determines the correct solution for any compact\ninitial condition. Third, we argue that dynamically moving the spatial origin\nand dynamically stretching time improves the description of the stochastic\nsimilarity. Lastly, an application to an extremely simple model of turbulent\nmixing shows how anomalous fluctuations may arise in eddy diffusivities. The\ntechniques and results we discuss should be applicable to a wide range of\nstochastic similarity problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2011 03:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}

In\nthis regime, accretion rate onto neutron star is determined by the ability of\nplasma to enter magnetosphere via Rayleigh-Taylor instability. A gas-dynamic\ntheory of settling accretion is constructed taking into account anisotropic\nturbulence.

This problem is often\nformulated as a nonlinear least squares problem, where data arises from\ninterest point matching. Mismatched interest points cause serious problems in\nthis approach, as a single mismatch will affect the entire reconstruction. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel robust Student's t BA algorithm (RST-BA). We\nmodel reprojection errors using the heavy tailed Student's t-distribution, and\nuse an implicit trust region method to compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nestimate of the camera and viewing parameters in this model. The resulting\nalgorithm exploits the sparse structure essential for reconstructing\nmulti-image scenarios, has the same time complexity as standard L2 bundle\nadjustment (L2-BA), and can be implemented with minimal changes to the standard\nleast squares framework. We show that the RST-BA is more accurate than either\nL2-BA or L2-BA with a sigma-edit rule for outlier removal for a range of\nsimulated error generation scenarios. The new method has also been used to\nreconstruct lunar topography using data from the NASA Apollo 15 orbiter, and we\npresent visual and quantitative comparisons of RST-BA and L2-BA methods for\nthis application.

Either of the two protein products can dimerize, forming a repressor\nmolecule that binds to the promotor of the other gene. When the repressor is\nbound to a promotor, the corresponding gene is not transcribed and no protein\nis produced. Either one of the promotors can be repressed at any given time or\nboth can be unrepressed, leaving three possible promotor states. This model is\nanalysed in its bistable regime in which the deterministic limit exhibits two\nstable fixed points and an unstable saddle, and the case of small noise is\nconsidered. On small time scales, the stochastic process fluctuates near one of\nthe stable fixed points, and on large time scales, a metastable transition can\noccur, where fluctuations drive the system past the unstable saddle to the\nother stable fixed point. To explore how different intrinsic noise sources\naffect these transitions, fluctuations in protein production and degradation\nare eliminated, leaving fluctuations in the promotor state as the only source\nof noise in the system. Perturbation methods are then used to compute the\nstability landscape and the distribution of transition times, or first exit\ntime density. To understand how protein noise affects the system, small\nmagnitude fluctuations are added back into the process, and the stability\nlandscape is compared to that of the process without protein noise. It is found\nthat significant differences in the random process emerge in the presence of\nprotein noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2011 13:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-12"}

According to\nour proposal, the matter density function at a space-time point x is obtained\nfrom the wave function psi on the past light cone of x by setting the i-th\nparticle position in |psi|^2 equal to x, integrating over the other particle\npositions, and averaging over i. We show that the predictions that follow from\nthis proposal agree with all known experimental facts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2011 15:27:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 01:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 14:27:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 16:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

Here we present SLIQ, a set of simple linear inequalities derived from\nthe geometry of contigs on the line that can be used to predict the relative\npositions and orientations of contigs from individual mate pair reads and thus\nproduce a contig digraph. The SLIQ inequalities can also filter out unreliable\nmate pairs and can be used as a preprocessing step for any scaffolding\nalgorithm. We tested the SLIQ inequalities on five real data sets ranging in\ncomplexity from simple bacterial genomes to complex mammalian genomes and\ncompared the results to the majority voting procedure used by many other\nscaffolding algorithms. SLIQ predicted the relative positions and orientations\nof the contigs with high accuracy in all cases and gave more accurate position\npredictions than majority voting for complex genomes, in particular the human\ngenome. Finally, we present a simple scaffolding algorithm that produces linear\nscaffolds given a contig digraph. We show that our algorithm is very efficient\ncompared to other scaffolding algorithms while maintaining high accuracy in\npredicting both contig positions and orientations for real data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2011 15:46:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 15:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

In particular epsilon_K, parameterising indirect CP violation in the\nneutral Kaon system, serves as an important constraint on models of new physics\nand is well suited for the indirect search for heavy new particles. In order to\nexploit this potential, a precise prediction of the standard-model background\nis crucial. I give a short summary of the standard-model prediction of\nepsilon_K, and present our recent NNLO QCD calculation of the charm-quark\ncontribution eta_cc to the |Delta S| = 2 effective Hamiltonian. We find a large\n36% shift with respect to the NLO value that leads to eta_cc = 1.87(76),\nshifting the standard-model prediction to |epsilon_K| = 1.81(28) x 10^-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2011 15:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}
