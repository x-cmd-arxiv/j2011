But it is claimed that spinors as such cannot be represented\nin coordinates in a curved space-time. What general covariance means for\ntheories with fermions is thus unclear. In fact both commonplaces are wrong.\nThough it is not widely known, Ogievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed\nspinors in coordinates in 1965, helping to spawn nonlinear group\nrepresentations. Locally, these spinors resemble the orthonormal basis or\n\"tetrad\" formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually\nself-sufficient. The tetrad formalism is de-Ockhamized, with 6 extra fields and\n6 compensating gauge symmetries. OP spinors, as developed nonperturbatively by\nBilyalov, admit any coordinates at a point, but \"time\" must be listed first:\nthe product of the metric components and the matrix diag(-1,1,1,1) must have no\nnegative eigenvalues to yield a real symmetric square root function of the\nmetric. Thus the admissible coordinates depend on the types and values of the\nfields. Apart from coordinate order and spinorial two-valuedness, OP spinors\nform, with the metric, a nonlinear geometric object, with Lie and covariant\nderivatives. Such spinors avoid a spurious absolute object in the\nAnderson-Friedman analysis of substantive general covariance. They also permit\nthe gauge-invariant localization of the infinite-component gravitational energy\nin GR. Density-weighted spinors exploit the conformal invariance of the\nmassless Dirac equation to show that the volume element is absent. Thus instead\nof a matrix with 16 components, one can use weighted OP spinors coupled to the\n9-component symmetric unimodular square root of the conformal metric density.\nThe surprising mildness of the restrictions on coordinates for the\nSchwarzschild solution is exhibited.

Most interference alignment algorithms require\nknowledge of all the interfering channels to compute the alignment precoders.\nCSI, considered available at the receivers, can be shared with the transmitters\nvia limited feedback. When alignment is done by coding over frequency\nextensions in a single antenna system, the required CSI lies on the\nGrassmannian manifold and its structure can be exploited in feedback.\nUnfortunately, the number of channels to be shared grows with the square of the\nnumber of users, creating too much overhead with conventional feedback methods.\nThis paper proposes Grassmannian differential feedback to reduce feedback\noverhead by exploiting both the channel's temporal correlation and Grassmannian\nstructure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is characterized both\nanalytically and numerically as a function of channel length, mobility, and the\nnumber of feedback bits. The main conclusions are that the proposed feedback\nstrategy allows interference alignment to perform well over a wide range of\nDoppler spreads, and to approach perfect CSI performance in slowly varying\nchannels.

As application, the 2D WKB\nmethod is applied to investigate the shaping effects (elongation and\ntriangularity) of tokamak geometry on the lower hybrid wave propagation and\nabsorbtion.

As a training method a\ncombination of a pilot-assisted scheme and a biased signaling scheme is\nconsidered. The achievable rates of successive decoding (SD) receivers based on\nthe linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation are analyzed\nin the large-system limit, by using the replica method under the assumption of\nreplica symmetry. It is shown that negligible pilot information is best in\nterms of the achievable rates of the SD receivers in the large-system limit.\nThe obtained analytical formulas of the achievable rates can improve the\nexisting lower bound on the capacity of the MIMO channel with no channel state\ninformation (CSI), derived by Hassibi and Hochwald, for all signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs). The comparison between the obtained bound and a high SNR\napproximation of the channel capacity, derived by Zheng and Tse, implies that\nthe high SNR approximation is unreliable unless quite high SNR is considered.\nEnergy efficiency in the low SNR regime is also investigated in terms of the\npower per information bit required for reliable communication. The required\nminimum power is shown to be achieved at a positive rate for the SD receiver\nwith no CSI, whereas it is achieved in the zero-rate limit for the case of\nperfect CSI available at the receiver. Moreover, numerical simulations imply\nthat the presented large-system analysis can provide a good approximation for\nnot so large systems.

The quantum vacuum of Standard\nModel is one of the representatives of topological matter alongside with\ntopological superfluids and superconductors, topological insulators and\nsemi-metals, etc. There is a number of of topological invariants in momentum\nspace of different dimensions.

Therefore, the\nDirac equation is generally equivalent to one fourth-order partial differential\nequation for one real function (A. Akhmeteli, J. Math. Phys. v.52, 082303\n(2011)). These results both belong in textbooks and can be used for development\nof new efficient methods of quantum chemistry. The matter field can be\nalgebraically eliminated both in scalar electrodynamics and in spinor\nelectrodynamics in a certain gauge. The resulting equations describe\nindependent dynamics of the electromagnetic field, which permits mathematical\nsimplification and can be useful for interpretation of quantum theory. For\nexample, in the Bohm interpretation, the electromagnetic field can replace the\nwave function as the guiding field. It is also shown that for these equations,\ngeneralized Carleman embedding generates systems of linear equations in the\nHilbert space, which look like second-quantized theories and are equivalent to\nthe original nonlinear systems on the set of solutions of the latter. Thus, the\nrelevant local realistic models can be embedded into quantum field theories.\nThese models are equivalent to scalar electrodynamics and spinor\nelectrodynamics, so they correctly describe a large body of experimental data.\nAlthough they may need some modifications for better agreement with\nexperiments, they may be of great interest as \"no drama quantum theories\", as\nsimple (in principle) as classical electrodynamics.

We show that this network distinguishes from\nmany other real networks from a high density, giving it a particular structure\nthat we call concentrated world and that differentiates a national legal system\n(as considered with a resolution at the code level) from small-world graphs\nidentified in many social networks. Our analysis then shows that a few\ncommunities (groups of highly wired vertices) of codes covering large domains\nof regulation are structuring the whole system. Indeed we mainly find a central\ngroup of influent codes, a group of codes related to social issues and a group\nof codes dealing with territories and natural resources.
