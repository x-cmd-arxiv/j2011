Temperature-dependent electrical\nresistivity, $\\rho(T)$, and the Seebeck coefficient, $S(T)$, measurements\nreveal metal-like behavior for all samples. For $x = 5$ and 6, density\nfunctional theory calculations are performed for deriving the enthalpy of\nformation and the electronic structure which is exploited for the calculation\nof Seebeck coefficients and conductivity within Boltzmann's transport theory.\nFor simulating the properties of doped clathrates the rigid band model is\napplied.

For non-Abelian\nvortex excitations arranged on superlattices, we observe the nucleation of\nseveral distinct Abelian topological phases whose character is found to depend\non microscopic parameters such as the superlattice spacing or the spin exchange\ncouplings. By reformulating the interacting vortex superlattice in terms of an\neffective model of Majorana fermion zero modes, we show that the nature of the\ncollective many-anyon state can be fully traced back to the microscopic\npairwise vortex interactions. Due to RKKY-type sign oscillations in the\ninteractions, we find that longer-range interactions beyond nearest neighbor\ncan influence the collective state and thus need to be included for a\ncomprehensive picture. The omnipresence of such interactions implies that\ncorresponding results should hold for vortices forming an Abrikosov lattice in\na p-wave superconductor, quasiholes forming a Wigner crystal in non-Abelian\nquantum Hall states or topological nanowires arranged in regular arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 17:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 21:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 13:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 07:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-15"}

The mission is focused on the low frequency region\n([0.1; 10] mHz) of the available signal spectrum. In such a region the signal\nis dominated by the force noise acting on test masses. Noise analysis is\nexpected to deal with a limited amount of non-Gaussian data, since the spectrum\nstatistics will be far from Gaussian and the lowest available frequency is\nlimited by the data length. In this paper we analyze the details of the\nexpected statistics for spectral data and develop two suitable excess noise\nestimators. One is based on the statistical properties of the integrated\nspectrum, the other is based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The sensitivity of the\nestimators is discussed theoretically for independent data, then the algorithms\nare tested on LPF synthetic data. The test on realistic LPF data allows the\neffect of spectral data correlations on the efficiency of the different noise\nexcess estimators to be highlighted. It also reveals the versatility of the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov approach, which can be adapted to provide reasonable results\non correlated data from a modified version of the standard equations for the\ninversion of the test statistic. Closely related to excess noise detection, the\nproblem of noise parameter identification in non-Gaussian data is approached in\ntwo ways. One procedure is based on maximum likelihood estimator and another is\nbased on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit estimator. Both approaches\nprovide unbiased and accurate results for noise parameter estimation and\ndemonstrate superior performance with respect to standard weighted\nleast-squares and Huber's norm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 18:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It\nreproduces, placing a copy of itself on a neighbouring vertex chosen uniformly\nat random, replacing the individual that was there. The initial population\nconsists of a single mutant of fitness $r>0$ placed uniformly at random, with\nevery other vertex occupied by an individual of fitness 1. The main quantities\nof interest are the probabilities that the descendants of the initial mutant\ncome to occupy the whole graph (fixation) and that they die out (extinction);\nalmost surely, these are the only possibilities.

Here we present the results of simulations of\nlattice QCD with 3 colour-sextet quarks at finite temperatures on lattices of\ntemporal extent $N_t=4$ and 6, with masses small enough to yield access to the\nchiral limit. As for the 2-flavour case, we find well-separated deconfinement\nand chiral-symmetry restoration transitions, both of which move to appreciably\nweaker couplings as $N_t$ is increased from 4 to 6. If this theory is\nconformal, we would expect there to be a bulk chiral transition at a fixed\ncoupling. For this reason we conclude that for $N_t=4$ and 6, the chiral and\nhence the deconfinement transitions are in the strong-coupling domain where the\ntheory is essentially quenched. The similarity between the behaviours of the 2\nand 3 flavour theories suggested that the $N_t=4$ and 6 transitions for the\n2-flavour theory also lie in the strong-coupling domain.

This geometric test has been demonstrated several\ntimes using massive clusters which produce a large lensing signal. In this\ncase, matter at a single redshift dominates the lensing signal, so the analysis\nis straightforward. It is less clear how weaker signals from multiple sources\nat different redshifts can be stacked to demonstrate the geometric dependence.\nWe introduce a simple measure of relative shear which for flat cosmologies\nseparates the effect of lens and source positions into multiplicative terms,\nallowing signals from many different source-lens pairs to be combined. Applying\nthis technique to a sample of groups and low-mass clusters in the COSMOS\nsurvey, we detect a clear variation of shear with distance behind the lens.\nThis represents the first detection of the geometric effect using weak lensing\nby multiple, low-mass systems. The variation of distance with redshift is\nmeasured with sufficient precision to constrain the equation of state of the\nuniverse under the assumption of flatness, equivalent to a detection of a dark\nenergy component Omega_X at greater than 99% confidence for an\nequation-of-state parameter -2.5 < w < -0.1.

Often this quantity to be measured is smeared by\na non-ideal detector response or by some physical process. The procedure of\nremoving this smearing effect from the measured distribution is called\nunfolding, and is a delicate problem in signal processing, due to the\nwell-known numerical ill behavior of this task. Various methods were invented\nwhich, given some assumptions on the initial probability distribution, try to\nregularize the unfolding problem. Most of these methods definitely introduce\nbias into the estimate of the initial probability distribution. We propose a\nlinear iterative method, which has the advantage that no assumptions on the\ninitial probability distribution is needed, and the only regularization\nparameter is the stopping order of the iteration, which can be used to choose\nthe best compromise between the introduced bias and the propagated statistical\nand systematic errors. The method is consistent: \"binwise\" convergence to the\ninitial probability distribution is proved in absence of measurement errors\nunder a quite general condition on the response function. This condition holds\nfor practical applications such as convolutions, calorimeter response\nfunctions, momentum reconstruction response functions based on tracking in\nmagnetic field etc. In presence of measurement errors, explicit formulae for\nthe propagation of the three important error terms is provided: bias error,\nstatistical error, and systematic error. A trade-off between these three error\nterms can be used to define an optimal iteration stopping criterion, and the\nerrors can be estimated there. We provide a numerical C library for the\nimplementation of the method, which incorporates automatic statistical error\npropagation as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 23:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 19:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Apr 2014 19:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

Such\npulsars may also be important in modeling the quiescent state of several low\nmass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), where optical observations of the companion star\nsuggest the possible existence of rotation powered MSPs. To understand the\nobservational properties of the different evolutionary stages of MSPs, the\nX-ray and $\\gamma$-ray emission associated with the outer gap model is\ninvestigated. For rotation powered MSPs, the size of the outer gap and the\nproperties of the high-energy emission are controlled by either the\nphoton-photon pair-creation process or magnetic pair-creation process near the\nsurface. For these pulsars, we find that the outer gap model controlled by the\nmagnetic pair-creation process is preferable in explaining the possible\ncorrelations between the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity or non-thermal X-ray\nluminosity versus the spin down power. For the accreting MSPs in quiescent\nLMXBs, the thermal X-ray emission at the neutron star surface resulting from\ndeep crustal heating can control the conditions in the outer gap. We argue that\nthe optical modulation observed in the quiescent state of several LMXBs\noriginates from the irradiation of the donor star by $\\gamma$-rays from the\nouter gap.

This is partly due to extensive studies of historical plate archives by\nRene Hudec and associates, and partly due to several observing campaigns in\nrecent times. Here we summarize the results of the 2005 - 2010 observing\ncampaign, in which several hundred scientists and amateur astronomers took\npart. The main results are the following: (1) The 2005 October optical outburst\ncame at the expected time, thus confirming the General Relativistic precession\nin the binary black hole system. At the same time, this result disproved the\nmodel of a single black hole system with accretion disk oscillations, as well\nas several toy models of binaries without relativistic precession. (2) The\nnature of the radiation of the 2005 October outburst was expected to be\nbremsstrahlung from hot gas at a temperature of 3 10^5 degrees K. This was\nconfirmed by combined ground based and ultraviolet observations using the\nXMM-Newton X-ray telescope. (3) A secondary outburst of the same nature was\nexpected at 2007 September 13. Within the accuracy of the observations (about 6\nhours), it started at the correct time. Due to the bremsstrahlung nature of the\noutburst, the radiation was unpolarized, as expected. (4) Further synchrotron\noutbursts were expected following the two bremsstrahlung outbursts. They came\nas scheduled between 2007 October and 2009 December. (5) Due to the effect of\nthe secondary on the overall direction of the jet, the parsec scale jet is\nexpected to rotate in the sky by a large angle, which has been confirmed. The\nOJ287 binary black hole system is currently our best laboratory for testing\ntheories of gravitation. Using OJ287, the correctness of General Relativity has\nnow been demonstrated up to the second Post-Newtonian order, higher than has\nbeen possible using binary pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 10:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-16"}

Moreover, this strong Be depletion in cool objects takes place\nfor all the stars regardless of the presence of planets, thus, the effect of\nextra Li depletion in solar-type stars with planets when compared with stars\nwithout detected planets does not seem to be present for Be, although the\nnumber of stars at those temperatures is still small to reach a final\nconclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 10:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

These red-shifts are followed by blue-shifts with upward velocities up to\n-5 km/s indicating relaxation of the plasma behind the wave front. During the\nwave evolution, the downward velocity pulse steepens from a few km/s up to 20\nkm/s and subsequently decays, correlated with the relative changes of the line\nintensities. The expected increase of the plasma densities at the EIT wave\nfront estimated from the observed intensity increase lies within the noise\nlevel of our density diagnostics from EIS XIII 202/203 AA line ratios.

Dispersion relations of spin waves in thin magnetic\nfilms (in two-dimensional magnetic monolayers and in two-layer magnetic films)\nand the spin-wave resonance spectrum in N-layer structures are found. For thick\nmagnetic films generalized Landau-Lifshitz equations are derived from first\nprinciples. Landau-Lifshitz equations have the integral (pseudodifferential)\nform, but not differential one. Spin excitations are determined by simultaneous\nsolution of the Landau-Lifshitz equations and the equation for the\nmagnetostatic potential. For normal magnetized ferromagnetic films the spin\nwave damping has been calculated in the one-loop approximation for a diagram\nexpansion of the Green functions at low temperature. In thick magnetic films\nthe magnetic dipole interaction makes a major contribution to the relaxation of\nlong-wavelength spin waves. Thin films have a region of low relaxation of\nlong-wavelength spin waves. In thin magnetic films four-spin-wave processes\ntake place and the exchange interaction makes a major contribution to the\ndamping. It is found that the damping of spin waves propagating in magnetic\nmonolayer is proportional to the quadratic dependence on the temperature and is\nvery low for spin waves with small wavevectors. Spin-wave devices on the base\nof nanosized magnetic films are proposed -- tunable narrow-band spin-wave\nfilters with high quality at the microwave frequency range and field-effect\ntransistor (FET) structures contained nanosized magnetic films under the gate\nelectrode. Spin-wave resonances in nanosized magnetic films can be used to\nconstruct FET structures operating in Gigahertz and Terahertz frequency bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 14:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-16"}

Our analysis shows that the filaments in the\ngradient can be produced by shocks as well as random fluctuations\ncharacterizing the non-differentiable field of MHD turbulence. The latter\ndominates for subsonic turbulence, while the former dominates for supersonic\nturbulence.

We suggest that a\nsimple liquid should be defined instead by the property of having strong\ncorrelation between virial and potential energy equilibrium fluctuations in the\nNVT ensemble. There is considerable overlap between the two definitions, but\nalso some notable differences. For instance, in the new definition simplicity\nis not a property of the intermolecular potential only because a liquid is\nusually only strongly correlating in part of its phase diagram. Moreover,\naccording to the new definition not all simple liquids are atomic (i.e., with\nradially symmetric pair potentials) and not all atomic liquids are simple. The\nmain part of the paper motivates the new definition of liquid simplicity by\npresenting evidence that a liquid is strongly correlating if and only if its\nintermolecular interactions may be ignored beyond the first coordination shell\n(FCS). This is demonstrated by NVT simulations of structure and dynamics of 15\natomic and molecular model liquids with a shifted-forces cutoff placed at the\nfirst minimum of the radial distribution function. No proof is given that the\nchemical characterization follows from the strong correlation property, but it\nis shown to be consistent with the existence of isomorphs in strongly\ncorrelating liquids' phase diagram. Finally, we note that the FCS\ncharacterization of simple liquids calls into question the basis for standard\nperturbation theory, according to which the repulsive and attractive forces\nplay fundamentally different roles for the physics of liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 15:41:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 20:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-19"}

It has been reported\nthat the energy of electrons injected into one of the two chiral edge channels\nwith the help of a quantum point contact (QPC) is equally distributed between\nthem, in agreement with earlier predictions, one being based on the Fermi gas\napproach, and the other utilizing the Luttinger liquid theory. We argue that\nthe physics of the energy relaxation process at the QH edge may in fact be more\nrich, providing the possibility for discriminating between two physical\npictures in experiment. Namely, using the recently proposed non-equilibrium\nbosonization technique we evaluate the electron distribution function and find\nthat the initial \"double-step\" distribution created at a QPC evolves through\nseveral intermediate asymptotics, before reaching eventual equilibrium state.\nAt short distances the distribution function is found to be asymmetric due to\nnon-Gaussian current noise effects. At larger distances, where noise becomes\nGaussian, the distribution function acquires symmetric Lorentzian shape.\nImportantly, in the regime of low QPC transparencies T the width of the\nLorentzian scales linearly with T, in contrast to the case of equilibrium Fermi\ndistribution, whose width scales as square root of T. Therefore, we propose to\ndo measurements at low QPC transparencies.

More precisely, it is impossible to\nreproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions using a non-contextual realist\nmodel, i.e., a model where the outcome of one measurement is independent of the\nchoice of compatible measurements performed in the measurement context. There\nhas been several attempts to quantify the amount of contextuality for specific\nquantum systems, for example, in the number of rays needed in a KS proof, or\nthe number of terms in certain inequalities, or in the violation, noise\nsensitivity, and other measures. This paper is about another approach: to use a\nsimple contextual model that reproduces the quantum-mechanical contextual\nbehaviour, but not necessarily all quantum predictions. The amount of\ncontextuality can then be quantified in terms of additional resources needed as\ncompared with a similar model without contextuality. In this case the\ncontextual model needs to keep track of the context used, so the appropriate\nmeasure would be memory. Another way to view this is as a memory requirement to\nbe able to reproduce quantum contextuality in a realist model. The model we\nwill use can be viewed as an extension of Spekkens' toy model [Phys. Rev. A 75,\n032110 (2007)], and the relation is studied in some detail. To reproduce the\nquantum predictions for the Peres-Mermin square, the memory requirement is more\nthan one bit in addition to the memory used for the individual outcomes in the\ncorresponding noncontextual model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 15:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

The gain we expect from this\napproach is the improved capacity to extract information on how people are\ncooperating and their relationship with the information they are working with.\nThe ideas are introduced while focusing on real life emergency planning\nactivities, where we discuss the current shortcomings of the cooperation\nstrategies in use and propose a solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 11:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-24"}

Grafcet, or\nSequential Function Charts (SFC), is a special class of Petri Nets and is\nbecoming the standard representation for sequential control systems. The\nproposed framework accepts a graphical (through ISaGRAPH) or textual\nbehavioural specification of the control system to be implemented. It follows\nthe usual procedure in software specification: the first step is to formally\nvalidate the initial specification. Then the initial specification is\ntranslated through automated processes into an implementation. At the moment\nthere are two possible output languages: C and Palasm [1]. The target processor\nfor the C code language are microcontroller based systems that require extended\ntime constrains and access to external peripherals. The goal of including PLD's\nis the possibility of automatically design mixed hardware and software systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 10:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-26"}
