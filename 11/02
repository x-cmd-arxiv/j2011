We have focused on disordered systems, addressing two traditional\nproblems in three spatial dimensions: the Edwards-Anderson spin glass and the\nDiluted Antiferromagnet in a Field (the physical realisation of the\nrandom-field Ising model). These systems have been studied by means of\nlarge-scale Monte Carlo simulations, exploiting a variety of platforms, which\ninclude the Janus special-purpose supercomputer. Two main themes are explored\nthroughout: a) the relationship between the (experimentally unreachable)\nequilibrium phase and the non-equilibrium evolution and b) the computation and\nefficient treatment of rugged free-energy landscapes.\n  We perform a thorough study of the low-temperature phase of the D=3\nEdwards-Anderson spin glass, where we establish a time-length dictionary and a\nfinite-time scaling formalism to link, in a quantitative way, the experimental\nnon-equilibrium regime and the finite-size equilibrium phase. At the\nexperimentally relevant scales, the replica symmetry breaking theory emerges as\nthe appropriate theoretical picture.\n  We also introduce Tethered Monte Carlo, a general strategy for the study of\nsystems with rugged free-energy landscapes. This formalism provides a general\nmethod to guide the exploration of the configuration space by constraining one\nor more reaction coordinates.

The optical prompt emission was detected by\nSwift/UVOT, ROTSE-IIIb and BOOTES telescopes when the GRB was still radiating\nin the gamma-ray band. Nearly 200 s of observations were obtained\nsimultaneously from optical, X-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of the\nexceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6\norders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. By fitting the\ntime resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, an\ninteresting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard GRB\nsynchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. Although the prompt\noptical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit X/gamma-ray\nspectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation to\nthe prompt high energy emission. The synchrotron + SSC scenario is disfavored\nby the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having two\nemission regions can interpret the data well. Shortly after prompt emission (~\n1100 s), a bright (R = 14.0) optical emission hump with very steep rise (alpha\n~ 5.5) was observed which we interpret as the emission from the reverse shock.\nIt is the first time that the rising phase of a reverse shock component has\nbeen closely observed. The full optical and X-ray afterglow lightcurves can be\ninterpreted within the standard reverse shock (RS) + forward shock (FS) model.\nIn general, the high quality prompt emission and afterglow data allow us to\napply the standard fireball shock model to extract valuable information about\nthe GRB including the radiation mechanism, radius of prompt emission R, initial\nLorentz factor of the outflow, the composition of the ejecta, as well as the\ncollimation angle and the total energy budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2011 19:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 19:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We perform the first realistic\nN-body computations of fully mass-segregated R136-type star clusters in which\nall the massive stars are in primordial binary systems.

Hence the\nconjecture of isolated massive star formation is unnecessary to account for\nthis VMS. Our results are also quite consistent with the ejection of 30 Dor\n016, another suspected runaway VMS from R136.

Using an idealized setup of a planar shock impacting a\ndense, spherical clump, we implant a population of Lagrangian particles into\nthe clump to represent a distribution of dust grains in size and composition.\nWe vary the relative velocity between the reverse shock and ejecta clump to\nexplore the effects of shock-heating and cloud compression. Because supernova\nejecta will be metal-enriched, we consider gas metallicities from Z/Zsun = 1 to\n100 and their influence on cooling properties of the cloud and the thermal\nsputtering rates of embedded dust grains. We post-process the simulation output\nto calculate grain sputtering for a variety of species and size distributions.\nIn the metallicity regime considered in this paper, the balance between\nincreased radiative cooling and increased grain erosion depends on the impact\nvelocity of the reverse shock. For slow shocks (velocity less than or equal to\n3000 km/s), the amount of dust destruction is comparable across metallicities,\nor in some cases is decreased with increased metallicity. For higher shock\nvelocities (velocity greater than or equal to 5000 km/s), an increase in\nmetallicity from Z/Zsun = 10 to 100 can lead to an additional 24% destruction\nof the initial dust mass. While the total dust destruction varies widely across\ngrain species and simulation parameters, our most extreme cases result in\ncomplete destruction for some grain species and only 44% dust mass survival for\nthe most robust species. These survival rates are important in understanding\nhow early supernovae contribute to the observed dust masses in high-redshift\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2011 20:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 16:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Which configurations are gatherable and how to gather all of them\ndeterministically by the same algorithm?\n  We give a complete solution of this gathering problem in arbitrary networks.\nWe characterize all gatherable configurations and give two universal\ndeterministic gathering algorithms, i.e., algorithms that gather all gatherable\nconfigurations. The first algorithm works under the assumption that an upper\nbound n on the size of the network is known.

We expect the two gene expression\nnetworks to be similar but not identical to each other, and so more accurate\nestimation of these two networks may be possible using a joint approach. We\npropose the joint graphical lasso for this purpose. Rather than estimating a\ngraphical model for each class separately, or a single graphical model across\nall classes, we borrow strength across the classes in order to estimate\nmultiple graphical models that share certain characteristics, such as the\nlocations or weights of nonzero edges. Our approach is based upon maximizing a\npenalized log likelihood. We employ fused lasso or group lasso penalties, and\nimplement a very fast computational approach that solves the joint graphical\nlasso problem.

Due to rapid expansion in sequence databases, such\nvery fast algorithms are becoming necessary. Other fast heuristics have been\ndeveloped for building trees from very large alignments (Price et al, and Brown\net al), but they lack theoretical performance guarantees. Our new algorithm\nruns in $O(n^{1+\\gamma(g)}\\log^2n)$ time, where $\\gamma$ is an increasing\nfunction of an upper bound on the branch lengths in the phylogeny, the upper\nbound $g$ must be below$1/2-\\sqrt{1/8} \\approx 0.15$, and $\\gamma(g)<1$ for all\n$g$. For phylogenies with very short branches, the running time of our\nalgorithm is close to linear. For example, if all branch lengths correspond to\na mutation probability of less than 0.02, the running time of our algorithm is\nroughly $O(n^{1.2}\\log^2n)$. Via a prototype and a sequence of large-scale\nexperiments, we show that many large phylogenies can be reconstructed fast,\nwithout compromising reconstruction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 04:21:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 07:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-01"}

The answers to these\nquestions involve not only the biology of plant vasculature, but also the\nphysical properties of water that enable such transport. Although early\nresearchers proposed the hypothesis of cohesion-tension of water as the likely\nmechanism for sap ascent, the exact mechanism of transport continues to be a\nhotly debated topic in the field of plant physiology.

Our approach is based on a novel multilevel\nhierarchical model that we refer to as a User Profile Model with Graphical\nLasso (UPG). The UPG provides a personalized recommendation to users by\nsimultaneously incorporating both user covariates and historical user\ninteractions with items in a model based way. In fact, we build a per-item\nregression model based on a rich set of user covariates and estimate individual\nuser affinity to items by introducing a latent random vector for each user. The\nvector random effects are assumed to be drawn from a prior with a precision\nmatrix that measures residual partial associations among items. To ensure\nbetter estimates of a precision matrix in high-dimensions, the matrix elements\nare constrained through a Lasso penalty. Our model is fitted through a\npenalized-quasi likelihood procedure coupled with a scalable EM algorithm. We\nemploy several computational strategies like multi-threading, conjugate\ngradients and heavily exploit problem structure to scale our computations in\nthe E-step. For the M-step we take recourse to a scalable variant of the\nGraphical Lasso algorithm for covariance selection. Through extensive\nexperiments on a new data set obtained from Yahoo! front page and a benchmark\ndata set from a movie recommender application, we show that our UPG model\nsignificantly improves performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods\nin the literature, especially those based on a bilinear random effects model\n(BIRE). In particular, we show that the gains of UPG are significant compared\nto BIRE when the number of users is large and the number of items to select\nfrom is small. For large item sets and relatively small user sets the results\nof UPG and BIRE are comparable. The UPG leads to faster model building and\nproduces outputs which are interpretable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 08:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-03"}

The instability is capable of transforming well-ordered flows into\ndisordered flows. As a result, it may be able to convert the energy found in,\nfor example, bowshocks from stellar jets into the turbulent energy found in\nmolecular clouds. As these clouds are weakly ionised, the ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic approximation does not apply at scales of around a tenth of\na parsec or less. This paper extends the work of Jones & Downes (2011) on the\nevolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the presence of multifluid\nmagnetohydrodynamic effects. These effects of ambipolar diffusion and the Hall\neffect are here studied together under physical parameters applicable to\nmolecular clouds. We restrict our attention to the case of a single shear layer\nwith a transonic, but super-Alfvenic, velocity jump and the computational\ndomain is chosen to match the wavelength of the linearly fastest growing mode\nof the instability.\n  We find that while the introduction of multifluid effects does not affect the\nlinear growth rates of the instability, the non-linear behaviour undergoes\nconsiderable change. The magnetic field is decoupled from the bulk flow as a\nresult of the ambipolar diffusion, which leads to a significant difference in\nthe evolution of the field. The Hall effect would be expected to lead to a\nnoticeable re-orientation of the magnetic field lines perpendicular to the\nplane. However, the results reveal that the combination with ambipolar\ndiffusion leads to a surprisingly effective suppression of this effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 09:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This study presents the observational signatures of the kink\ninstability in long coronal loops when parallel thermal conduction is included.\nThe 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic equations are solved numerically to\nsimulate the evolution of a coronal loop that is initially in an unstable\nequilibrium. The loop has length 80 Mm, width 8 Mm and an initial maximum twist\nof Phi = 11.5 pi, where Phi is a function of the radius. The initial loop\nparameters are obtained from a highly twisted loop observed in the TRACE 171 A\nwaveband. Synthetic observables are generated from the data. These observables\ninclude spatial and temporal averaging to account for the resolution and\nexposure times of TRACE images. Parallel thermal conduction reduces the maximum\nlocal temperature by up to an order of magnitude. This means that different\nspectral lines are formed and different internal loop structures are visible\nwith or without the inclusion of thermal conduction. However, the response\nfunctions sample a broad range of temperatures. The result is that the\ninclusion of parallel thermal conductivity does not have as large an impact on\nobservational signatures as the order of magnitude reduction in the maximum\ntemperature would suggest; the net effect is a blurring of internal features of\nthe loop structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 10:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

The dynamical tracers\nused (radius-sigma and luminosity-sigma diagrams) indicate that most of the\ncomplexes might be self-gravitating entities. The resistance to forces from the\nparent galaxy is studied by considering the tidal mass of the candidate and its\nrelative velocity with respect to the parent galaxy. After combining the\nresults of previous studies of TDG searches in ULIRGs a total of 9 complexes\nsatisfy most of the applied criteria and thus show a high-medium or high\nlikelihood of survival, their total mass likely being compatible with that of\ndwarf galaxies.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons.

CQED has\nrecently received renewed attention due to its implementation with\nsuperconducting artificial atoms and coplanar resonators in the so-called\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. In cQED, the couplings can\nbe much stronger than in CQED due to the design flexibility of superconducting\ncircuits and to the enhanced field confinement in one-dimensional cavities.\nThis enabled the realization of fundamental quantum physics and quantum\ninformation processing experiments with a degree of control comparable to that\nobtained in CQED.\n  The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the situation where the\nresonator to which the atom is coupled is made nonlinear with a Kerr-type\nnonlinearity, causing its energy levels to be nonequidistant. The system is\nthen described by a nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. This considerably\nenriches the physics since a pumped nonlinear resonator displays bistability,\nparametric amplification, and squeezing. The interplay of strong coupling and\nthese nonlinear effects constitutes a novel model system for quantum optics\nthat can be implemented experimentally with superconducting circuits.\n  This chapter is organized as follows. In a first section we present the\nsystem consisting of a superconducting Kerr nonlinear resonator strongly\ncoupled to a transmon qubit. In the second section, we describe the response of\nthe sole nonlinear resonator to an external drive. In the third section, we\nshow how the resonator bistability can be used to perform a high-fidelity\nreadout of the transmon qubit. In the last section, we investigate the quantum\nbackaction exerted by the intracavity field on the qubit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 13:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-03"}

These\nprocesses must be accompanied by the emission of neutrinos. Neutrinos are\nelectrically neutral and interact only weakly with ordinary matter; they thus\npropagate through the Universe without absorption or deflection, pointing back\nto their origin. Their feeble interaction, however, makes them extremely\ndifficult to detect. The years 2008-2010 have witnessed remarkable steps in\ndeveloping high energy neutrino telescopes.

The\nrapidly changing field is strong enough that it should be able to stress and\nrupture the star's crust, with potentially interesting seismic consequences.\nThis was confirmed in dramatic fashion a few years ago with the discovery of\nlong-lived seismic vibrations excited by rare giant flares. The starquakes\nassociated with the giant flares are, it seems, so catastrophic that they leave\nthe whole star ringing. These discoveries have opened up the possibility of\nusing asteroseismology to study the extreme conditions of the neutron star\ninterior - the dense matter equation of state in crust and core, and the core\nmagnetic field. This chapter reviews the main observational properties of the\noscillations seen in the giant flares, and the state of the art in terms of\ntheoretical models of global seismic vibrations in magnetars. I discuss efforts\nto extend oscillation searches to smaller magnetar bursts (which are more\nfrequent but less energetic), and the role that crust rupturing might play in\ntriggering magnetar flares and exciting global seismic oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 14:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-03"}

The pulsars\nwere found with a novel hierarchical search method originally developed for\ndetecting continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars.\nDesigned to find isolated pulsars spinning at up to kHz frequencies, the new\nmethod is computationally efficient, and incorporates several advances,\nincluding a metric-based gridding of the search parameter space (frequency,\nfrequency derivative and sky location) and the use of photon probability\nweights. The nine pulsars have spin frequencies between 3 and 12 Hz, and\ncharacteristic ages ranging from 17 kyr to 3 Myr. Two of them, PSRs J1803-2149\nand J2111+4606, are young and energetic Galactic-plane pulsars (spin-down power\nabove 6e35 erg/s and ages below 100 kyr). The seven remaining pulsars, PSRs\nJ0106+4855, J0622+3749, J1620-4927, J1746-3239, J2028+3332, J2030+4415,\nJ2139+4716, are older and less energetic; two of them are located at higher\nGalactic latitudes (|b| > 10 deg). PSR J0106+4855 has the largest\ncharacteristic age (3 Myr) and the smallest surface magnetic field (2e11 G) of\nall LAT blind-search pulsars. PSR J2139+4716 has the lowest spin-down power\n(3e33 erg/s) among all non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars ever found. Despite\nextensive multi-frequency observations, only PSR J0106+4855 has detectable\npulsations in the radio band. The other eight pulsars belong to the increasing\npopulation of radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 15:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

As expected, thermal propagation displays a diffusive\ncharacter and the spatial correlations decay exponentially in the direction\northogonal to the heat flow. However, we show that the approach to equilibrium\npresents an unexpected slow behavior. In particular, when the thermostat is at\ninfinite temperature, correlations decay to their asymptotic values by a power\nlaw. This can be rephrased in terms of a correlation length vanishing\nlogarithmically with time. At finite temperature, the approach to equilibrium\nis also a power law, but the exponents depend on the temperature in a\nnon-trivial way. This complex behavior could be explained in terms of two\ndynamical regimes characterizing finite and infinite temperatures,\nrespectively. When finite sizes are considered, we evidence the emergence of a\nmuch more rapid equilibration, and this confirms that the microcanonical\ndynamics can be successfully applied on finite structures.

This paper advocates spread spectrum modulation for\ninterstellar communication, motivated by robust immunity to radio-frequency\ninterference (RFI) of technological origin in the vicinity of the receiver\nwhile preserving full detection sensitivity in the presence of natural sources\nof noise. Receiver design for noise immunity alone provides no basis for\nchoosing a signal with any specific character, therefore failing to reduce\nambiguity. By adding RFI to noise immunity as a design objective, the\nconjunction of choice of signal (by the transmitter) together with optimum\ndetection for noise immunity (in the receiver) leads through simple\nprobabilistic argument to the conclusion that the signal should possess the\nstatistical properties of a burst of white noise, and also have a large\ntime-bandwidth product. Thus spread spectrum also provides an implicit\ncoordination between transmitter and receiver by reducing the ambiguity as to\nthe signal character. This strategy requires the receiver to guess the specific\nnoise-like signal, and it is contended that this is feasible if an appropriate\npseudorandom signal is generated algorithmically. For example, conceptually\nsimple algorithms like the binary expansion of common irrational numbers like\nPi are shown to be suitable. Due to its deliberately wider bandwidth, spread\nspectrum is more susceptible to dispersion and distortion in propagation\nthrough the interstellar medium, desirably reducing ambiguity in parameters\nlike bandwidth and carrier frequency. This suggests a promising new direction\nin interstellar communication using spread spectrum modulation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 15:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 18:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

The correlation coefficient between the\nintensities the Earth and V1 during this time period, is 0.936, allowing for a\n~0.9 year delay due to the solar wind propagation time from the Earth to the\nouter heliosphere. To describe these intensity changes and to predict the\nabsolute intensities measured at all three locations we have used a simple\nspherically symmetric (no drift) two-zone heliospheric transport model with\nspecific values for the diffusion coefficient in both the inner and outer\nzones. The diffusion coefficient in the outer zone, from about 90 to 120 (130)\nAU, is determined to be ~5-10 times smaller than that in the inner zone out to\n90 AU. This means that the outer zone acts much like a diffusing barrier in\nthis model. The absolute magnitude of the intensities and the intensity changes\nat V1 and the Earth are described to within a few percent by a diffusion\ncoefficient that varies with time by a factor ~4 in the inner zone and only\n~1.8 (1.25) in the outer zone over the time period from 2004-2010. These\ndiffusion coefficients and their variations are essentially the same as those\nderived earlier from a similar study using He nuclei of the same energy. This\nmodel and the diffusion coefficients used provide a total modulation potential\nat the Earth ~250 MV in 2009. The difference ~10-20% between calculated and\nobserved intensities at V2 can be explained if the heliosphere is squashed by\n~10% in distance (non-spherical) so that the HTS is closer to the Sun in the\ndirection of V2 compared to V1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2011 19:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-11"}
