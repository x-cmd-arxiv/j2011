This off-center flash is the first of a few\nsuccessive helium shell subflashes that remove the core electron degeneracy\nover 2 Myrs, converting the object into a He burning star. Though characterized\nby Thomas over 40 years ago, this core flash phase has yet to be\nobservationally probed. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar\nAstrophysics (MESA) code, we show that red giant asteroseismology enabled by\nspace-based photometry (i.e. Kepler and CoRoT) can probe these stars during the\nflash. The rapid (< 100,000 years) contraction of the red giant envelope after\nthe initiating flash dramatically improves the coupling of the p-modes to the\ncore g-modes, making the detection of l=1 mixed modes possible for these 2\nMyrs. This duration implies that 1 in 35 stars near the red clump in the HR\ndiagram will be in their core flash phase. During this time, the star has a\ng-mode period spacing of Delta P_g = 70-100 seconds, lower than the Delta\nP_g=250 seconds of He burning stars in the red clump, but higher than the RGB\nstars at the same luminosity. This places them in an underpopulated part of the\nlarge frequency spacing (Delta nu) vs. Delta P_g diagram that should ease their\nidentification amongst the thousands of observed red giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 16:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The approximate agreement of DENIS-P J1048-3956\nand other ultracool dwarfs with flux-flux relations for early-M dwarfs suggests\nthat the same heating mechanisms work in the atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs,\nalbeit weaker as judged from their lower fluxes.

At a density ratio close to unity (typically under water),\nvertical velocities are so small that sediment transport occurs in a thin layer\nat the surface of the static bed, and is called bed load. Steady, or\n'saturated' transport is reached when the fluid borne shear stress at the\ninterface between the mobile grains and the static grains is reduced to its\nthreshold value. The number of grains transported per unit surface is therefore\nlimited by the flux of horizontal momentum towards the surface. However, the\nfluid velocity in the transport layer remains almost undisturbed so that the\nmean grain velocity scales with the shear velocity u\\ast. At large density\nratio (typically in air), the vertical velocities are large enough to make the\ntransport layer wide and dilute. Sediment transport is then called saltation.\nIn this case, particles are able to eject others when they collide with the\ngranular bed, a process called splash. The number of grains transported per\nunit surface is selected by the balance between erosion and deposition and\nsaturation is reached when one grain is statistically replaced by exactly one\ngrain after a collision, which has the consequence that the mean grain velocity\nremains independent of u\\ast. The influence of the density ratio is\nsystematically studied to reveal the transition between these two transport\nregimes.

In particular light fields\nwith cylindrical symmetry such as Laguerre-Gaussian beams can possess orbital\nangular momentum, central to a wide range of emergent applications in quantum\ncryptography, manipulation, astrophysics and microscopy. A wide array of\ndiffractive structures such as arrays of pinholes, triangular apertures, slits,\nand holograms have all recently been used to measure the azimuthal index L of\nindividual LG beams. However, all these approaches measure only one single\ndegree of freedom of LG beams, neglecting the radial component or P index and\nare thus not applicable for a priori unknown beams. Furthermore, it is unclear\nwhich is the optimal aperture and scheme needed to determine simultaneously the\nazimuthal and radial indices nor the extent with which such an aperture can\ntolerate deviations in beam parameters. Here, we demonstrate a powerful\napproach to simultaneously measure the radial and azimuthal indices of both\npure and mixed LG light fields. We show that the shape of the diffracting\nelement used to measure the mode indices is in fact of little importance and\nthe crucial step is training any diffracting optical system and transforming\nthe observed pattern into uncorrelated variables. Modest fluctuations in beam\nparameters such as waist size and alignment variations can be tolerated in our\nscheme. Importantly, beam superpositions can be experimentally decomposed\ndelivering the intensity of each mode and their relative phases. Our results\ndemonstrate the complete characterisation of LG beams.

The present survey expands the sample of diffuse cloud sight lines\nwith H3+ observations to 50, with detections in 21 of those. Ionization rates\ninferred from these observations are in the range (1.7+-1.3)x10^-16\ns^-1<zeta_2<(10.6+-8.2)x10^-16 s^-1 with a mean value of\nzeta_2=(3.5^+5.3_-3.0)x10^-16 s^-1.

These low\nupper-limits, in combination with the wide range of inferred cosmic-ray\nionization rates, indicate variations in zeta_2 between different diffuse cloud\nsight lines. A study of zeta_2 versus N_H (total hydrogen column density) shows\nthat the two parameters are not correlated for diffuse molecular cloud sight\nlines, but that the ionization rate decreases when N_H increases to values\ntypical of dense molecular clouds. Both the difference in ionization rates\nbetween diffuse and dense clouds and the variation of zeta_2 among diffuse\ncloud sight lines are likely the result of particle propagation effects. The\nlower ionization rate in dense clouds is due to the inability of low-energy\n(few MeV) protons to penetrate such regions, while the ionization rate in\ndiffuse clouds is controlled by the proximity of the observed cloud to a site\nof particle acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 19:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We confirm that for disks around solar-mass stars,\ninfall at high rates at radii beyond ~50 AU leads to disk fragmentation.

We find that, once formed, the fragments or clumps migrate\ninward on typical type-I time scales of ~2e3 yr initially, but later migration\ndeviates from the type-I time scale when the clump becomes more massive than\nthe local disk mass, and/or when they starts to open gaps. As they migrate, the\nclumps accrete from the disk at a rate 1e-3 to 1e-1 MJupiter/yr, consistent\nwith analytic estimates that assume a 1-2 Hill radii cross section. Most clumps\ncan grow to their isolation masses >0.1 Msun quickly. The eventual fates of\nthese clumps, however, diverges depending on the migration speed: 3 out of 13\nclumps become massive enough (brown dwarf mass) to open gaps in the disk and\nessentially stop migrating; 4 are tidally destroyed during inward migration; 6\nmigrate across the inner simulated disk boundary. A simple analytic model for\nclump evolution is derived to explain these different fates. Overall, our\nresults indicate that fast migration, accretion, and tidal destruction of the\nclumps pose challenges to the scenario of giant planet formation by GI in situ,\nbut may provide a formation mechanism for close binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 19:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In\nthis work, we co-add existing Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging on the\nequatorial stripe in order to build a data set with the statistical power to\nmeasure cosmic shear, while using a rounding kernel method to null out the\neffects of the anisotropic PSF. We build a galaxy catalogue from the combined\nimaging, characterise its photometric properties, and show that the spurious\nshear remaining in this catalogue after the PSF correction is negligible\ncompared to the expected cosmic shear signal. We identify a new source of\nsystematic error in the shear-shear auto-correlations arising from selection\nbiases related to masking. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which this\nmethod is expected to be useful for upcoming ground-based surveys that have\nlensing as one of the science goals, and identify the systematic errors that\ncan reduce its efficacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 20:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

We then compare our measurements with a\ntree-level perturbative prediction finding good agreement at large scale when\nthe constant Gaussian bias parameter, both linear and quadratic, and their\nconstant non-Gaussian corrections are fitted for. The best-fit values of the\nGaussian bias factors and their non-Gaussian, scale-independent corrections are\nin qualitative agreement with the peak-background split expectations. In\nparticular, we show that the effect of non-Gaussian initial conditions on\nsqueezed configurations is fairly large (up to 30% for f_NL=100 at redshift\nz=0.5) and results from contributions of similar amplitude induced by the\ninitial matter bispectrum, scale-dependent bias corrections as well as from\nnonlinear matter bispectrum corrections.

Because this energy is\nreleased in the core rather than the envelope, the overall structure of the\nstar, and so its luminosity, is driven toward that of a red clump star from its\ninitial position at the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). This occurs on a\nfirst (and well recognized) Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale t_{KH,1} ~ E_env/L_TRGB\n~ 1e4 yrs., where E_env is the thermal energy stored in the envelope and L_TRGB\nis the luminosity at the TRGB.

It is this second Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale that\ndetermines the overall pace of the moderately violent processes by which the\nstar returns to nuclear-power generation as a full-fledged clump star. The\nreservoir of gravitational energy acts as ultimate regulator, providing\nwhatever supplemental energy is needed to power L_clump and occasionally\nabsorbing the large momentary excesses from helium mini-flashes.

In a few cases, the\nprogenitor star is a yellow supergiant star. The estimated position in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram of these stars is not compatible with the\ntheoretical tracks of classical single star models. According to several\nauthors, the mass-loss rates during the red supergiant phase could be\nunderestimated. We study the impact of an increase of these mass-loss rates on\nthe position of 12 to 15 M\\odot stars at the end of their nuclear life, in\norder to reconcile the theoretical tracks with the observed yellow supergiant\nprogenitors. We perform calculations of 12 to 15 M\\odot rotating stellar models\nusing the Geneva stellar evolution code. To account for the uncertainties in\nthe mass-loss rates during the RSG phase, we increase the mass-loss rate of the\nstar (between 3 and 10 times the standard one) during that phase and compare\nthe evolution of stars undergoing such high mass-loss rates with models\ncomputed with the standard mass-loss prescription. We show that the final\nposition of the models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram depends on the mass\nloss they undergo during the red supergiant phase. With an increased mass-loss\nrate, we find that some models end their nuclear life at positions that are\ncompatible with the observed position of several supernova progenitors.

The high-temperature\nmagnetic properties are related to the independent paramagnetic behavior of the\ntwo magnetic metal ions within the binuclear entities both in [NiNd] and\n[NiGd]. On lowering the temperature, the formation of a magnetic dimer, with a\nlow-spin ground state due to antiferromagnetic interaction (J/kB = -25 K)\nbetween Ni2+ and Nd3+, is found in the case of [NiNd], while in [NiGd] a\nferromagnetic interaction (J/kB = 3.31 K) between the magnetic ions leads to a\nhigh-spin (S = 9/2) ground state. The temperature dependence of the proton\nnuclear spin lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 in [NiNd] is driven by the\nfluctuation of the hyperfine field at the nuclear site due to relaxation of the\nmagnetization. At high temperature the independent Ni2+ and Nd3+ spins\nfluctuate fast while at low temperature we observe a slowing down of the\nfluctuation of the total magnetization of the dimer because of the insurgence\nof antiferromagnetic spin correlations. The relaxation mechanism in [NiNd] at\nlow temperature is interpreted by a single, temperature dependent, correlation\nfrequency wc\\simT^3.5, which reflects the life time broadening of the exchange\ncoupled spins via spin-phonon interaction. The proton NMR signal in [NiGd]\ncould be detected just at room temperature, due to the shortening of relaxation\ntimes when T is decreased. The magnetic properties of [ZnGd] are the ones\nexpected from a weakly interacting assembly of isolated moments except for\nanomalies in the susceptibility and NMR results below 15 K which currently\ncannot be explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 22:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-01"}

They also appear to share common proper\nmotions. Follow-up optical spectroscopy reveals each system to consist of a DA\nand a H-rich high-field magnetic white dwarf (HFMWD). Our measurements of the\neffective temperatures and the surface gravities of the DA components reveal\nboth to have larger masses than are typical of field white dwarfs. By assuming\nthat these degenerates have evolved essentially as single stars, due to their\nwide orbital separations, we use them to place limits on the total ages of our\nstellar systems. These argue that in each case the HFMWD is probably associated\nwith an early type progenitor (M_init > 2M_solar). We find that the cooling\ntime of SDSSJ150746.80+520958.0 (DAH) is somewhat lower than might be expected\nhad it followed the evolutionary path of a typical single star. This mild\ndiscord is in the same sense as that observed for two of the small number of\nother HFMWDs for which progenitor mass estimates have been made, REJ0317-853\nand EG59. The mass of the other DAH, SDSSJ092646.88+132134.5, appears to be\nsmaller than expected on the basis of single star evolution. If this object\nwas/is a member of a hierarchical triple system it may have experienced greater\nmass loss during an earlier phase of its life as a result of it having a close\ncompanion.

Transient neutrino sources such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and\nSupernovae (SNe) are hypothesized to emit bursts of high-energy neutrinos on a\ntime-scale of \\lesssim 100 s. While GRB neutrinos would be produced in high\nrelativistic jets, core-collapse SNe might host soft-relativistic jets, which\nbecome stalled in the outer layers of the progenitor star leading to an\nefficient production of high-energy neutrinos. Aims. To increase the\nsensitivity to these neutrinos and identify their sources, a low-threshold\noptical follow-up program for neutrino multiplets detected with the IceCube\nobservatory has been implemented. Methods. If a neutrino multiplet, i.e. two or\nmore neutrinos from the same direction within 100 s, is found by IceCube a\ntrigger is sent to the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment, ROTSE. The\n4 ROTSE telescopes immediately start an observation program of the\ncorresponding region of the sky in order to detect an optical counterpart to\nthe neutrino events. Results. No statistically significant excess in the rate\nof neutrino multiplets has been observed and furthermore no coincidence with an\noptical counterpart was found. Conclusion. The search allows, for the first\ntime, to set stringent limits on current models predicting a high-energy\nneutrino flux from soft relativistic hadronic jets in core-collapse SNe. We\nconclude that a sub-population of SNe with typical Lorentz boost factor and jet\nenergy of 10 and 3\\times10^{51} erg, respectively, does not exceed 4.2% at 90%\nconfidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 02:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 23:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

Large-scale PIC simulations of reconnection and\ncompanion Riemann simulations of shock development demonstrate that the\npressure anisotropy produced by counterstreaming ions within the exhaust\nprevents the development of classical Petschek switch-off-slow shocks (SSS).\nThe shock structure that does develop is controlled by the firehose stability\nparameter epsilon=1-mu_0(P_parallel-P_perpendicular)/ B^2 through its influence\non the speed order of the intermediate and slow waves. Here P_parallel and\nP_perpendicular are the pressure parallel and perpendicular to the local\nmagnetic field. The exhaust boundary is made up of a series of two shocks and a\nrotational wave. The first shock takes epsilon from unity upstream to a plateau\nof 0.25 downstream. The condition epsilon =0.25 is special because at this\nvalue the speeds of nonlinear slow and intermediate waves are degenerate. The\nsecond slow shock leaves epsilon=0.25 unchanged but further reduces the\namplitude of the reconnecting magnetic field. Finally, in the core of the\nexhaust epsilon drops further and the transition is completed by a rotation of\nthe reconnecting field into the out-of-plane direction. The acceleration of the\nexhaust takes place across the two slow shocks but not during the final\nrotation. The result is that the outflow speed falls below that expected from\nthe Walen condition based on the asymptotic magnetic field.

Here we show that the empirical picture\nof angular momentum evolution arises naturally if rotation is related to\nmagnetic field strength instead of to magnetic flux, and formulate a corrected\nbraking law based on this. Angular momentum evolution then becomes a strong\nfunction of stellar radius, explaining the main trends observed in open\nclusters and field stars at a few Gyr: the steep transition in rotation at the\nboundary to full convection arises primarily from the large change in radius\nacross this boundary, and does not require changes in dynamo mode or field\ntopology. Additionally, the data suggest transient core-envelope decoupling\namong solar-type stars, and field saturation at longer periods in very low-mass\nstars. For solar-type stars, our model is also in good agreement with the\nempirical Skumanich law. Finally, in further support of the theory, we show\nthat the predicted age at which low-mass stars spin down from the saturated to\nunsaturated field regimes in our model corresponds remarkably well to the\nobserved lifetime of magnetic activity in these stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 07:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To this\nend, in this paper, we propose an alternative approach to investigate the CSI\nfeedback rate control problem in the analytical setting of a game theoretic\nframework, in which a multiple-antenna base station (BS) communicates with a\nnumber of co-channel MSs through linear precoder. Specifically, we first\npresent a non-cooperative feedback-rate control game (NFC), in which each MS\nselects the feedback rate to maximize its performance in a distributed way. To\nimprove efficiency from a social optimum point of view, we then introduce\npricing, called the non-cooperative feedback-rate control game with price\n(NFCP). The game utility is defined as the performance gain by CSI feedback\nminus the price as a linear function of the CSI feedback rate. The existence of\nthe Nash equilibrium of such games is investigated, and two types of feedback\nprotocols (FDMA and CSMA) are studied. Simulation results show that by\nadjusting the pricing factor, the distributed NFCP game results in close\noptimal performance compared with that of the centralized scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 09:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

A\nquestion that has been open for over 15 years is under what conditions the\ndifference between the two resulting regulated functions converges to zero for\nany choice of $a$ as time diverges.

The term Quantum Gravity itself is ambiguous as there are many\nproposals for its correct formulation and none of them have been verified\nexperimentally. In this thesis we consider a number of closely related\napproaches to two dimensional quantum gravity that share the property that they\nmay be formulated in terms of random graphs. In one such approach known as\nCausal Dynamical Triangulations, numerical computations suggest an interesting\nphenomenon in which the effective spacetime dimension is reduced in the UV. In\nthis thesis we first address whether such a dynamical reduction in the number\nof dimensions may be understood in a simplified model. We introduce a continuum\nlimit where this simplified model exhibits a reduction in the effective\ndimension of spacetime in the UV, in addition to having rich cross-over\nbehaviour.\n  In the second part of this thesis we consider an approach closely related to\ncausal dynamical triangulation; namely dynamical triangulation. Although this\ntheory is less well-behaved than causal dynamical triangulation, it is known\nhow to couple it to matter, therefore allowing for potentially multiple\nboundary states to appear in the theory. We address the conjecture of Seiberg\nand Shih which states that all these boundary states are degenerate and may be\nconstructed from a single principal boundary state. By use of the random graph\nformulation of the theory we compute the higher genus amplitudes with a single\nboundary and find that they violate the Seiberg-Shih conjecture. Finally we\ndiscuss whether this result prevents the replacement of boundary states by\nlocal operators as proposed by Seiberg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 12:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-01"}

Our new, higher resolution observations reveal that the complex HI\nfeatures detected by Arecibo are in reality two extraordinary long HI tails\nextending for ~160 and 250 kpc, respectively, i.e., among the longest HI\nstructures ever observed in groups of galaxies. Although in the case of RSCG42\nthe morphology and dynamics of the HI tail, as well as the optical properties\nof the group members, support a low-velocity tidal interaction scenario, less\nclear is the origin of the unique features associated with FGC1287. This galaxy\ndisplays an exceptionally long 'dog leg' HI tail and the large distance from\nthe X-ray emitting region of Abell 1367 makes a ram-pressure stripping scenario\nhighly unlikely. At the same time a low-velocity tidal interaction seems unable\nto explain the extraordinary length of the tail and the lack of any sign of\ndisturbance in the optical properties of FGC1287.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel problem called \"entity relationship\nexplanation\", which seeks to explain why a pair of entities are connected, and\nsolve this challenging problem by integrating the above two complementary\napproaches, i.e., we leverage the knowledge base to \"explain\" the connections\ndiscovered between entity pairs. More specifically, we present REX, a system\nthat takes a pair of entities in a given knowledge base as input and\nefficiently identifies a ranked list of relationship explanations. We formally\ndefine relationship explanations and analyze their desirable properties.\nFurthermore, we design and implement algorithms to efficiently enumerate and\nrank all relationship explanations based on multiple measures of\n\"interestingness.\" We perform extensive experiments over real web-scale data\ngathered from DBpedia and a commercial search engine, demonstrating the\nefficiency and scalability of REX. We also perform user studies to corroborate\nthe effectiveness of explanations generated by REX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 14:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-01"}

After reviewing the sources of difficulty, we present a Lorentz\ncovariant, real formulation in which second class constraints never arise.\nRather than a foliation of spacetime, we use a gauge field y, interpreted as a\nfield of observers, to break the SO(3,1) symmetry down to a subgroup SO(3)_y.\nThis symmetry breaking plays a role analogous to that in MacDowell-Mansouri\ngravity, which is based on Cartan geometry, leading us to a picture of gravity\nas 'Cartan geometrodynamics.' We study both Lorentz gauge transformations and\ntransformations of the observer field to show that the apparent breaking of\nSO(3,1) to SO(3) is not in conflict with Lorentz covariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 15:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 15:43:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 17:12:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 01:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-01"}

The\nelectronic band structure of the AB bilayer in the presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling and a transverse electric field is calculated from first-principles\nusing the linearized augmented plane wave method implemented in the WIEN2k\ncode. The first-principles results around the K points are fitted to a\ntight-binding model. The main conclusion is that the spin-orbit effects in\nbilayer graphene derive essentially from the single-layer spin-orbit coupling\nwhich comes almost solely from the d orbitals. The intrinsic spin-orbit\nsplitting (anticrossing) around the K points is about 24\\mu eV for the\nlow-energy valence and conduction bands, which are closest to the Fermi level,\nsimilarly as in the single layer graphene. An applied transverse electric field\nbreaks space inversion symmetry and leads to an extrinsic (also called\nBychkov-Rashba) spin-orbit splitting. This splitting is usually linearly\nproportional to the electric field. The peculiarity of graphene bilayer is that\nthe low-energy bands remain split by 24\\mu eV independently of the applied\nexternal field. The electric field, instead, opens a semiconducting band gap\nseparating these low-energy bands. The remaining two high-energy bands are\nspin-split in proportion to the electric field; the proportionality coefficient\nis given by the second intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, whose value is 20\\mu eV.\nAll the band-structure effects and their spin splittings can be explained by\nour tight-binding model, in which the spin-orbit Hamiltonian is derived from\nsymmetry considerations.
