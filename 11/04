However, in\nmost machine learning applications, it is not possible to request for labels of\nfictitious examples constructed by the algorithm.

The proposed scheme can\nbe applied to a wide variety of other physical systems including, trapped atoms\nand ions, quantum dots, and may be combined with other quantum technologies\nchallenges such as quantum sensing and quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 17:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 08:48:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 17:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-21"}

The band powers presented here cover\nangular scales 2000 < ell < 9400 in frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and\n220 GHz. At these frequencies and angular scales, a combination of the primary\nCMB anisotropy, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, radio\ngalaxies, and cosmic infrared background (CIB) contributes to the signal. We\ncombine Planck and SPT data at 220 GHz to constrain the amplitude and shape of\nthe CIB power spectrum and find strong evidence for non-linear clustering. We\nexplore the SZ results using a variety of cosmological models for the CMB and\nCIB anisotropies and find them to be robust with one exception: allowing for\nspatial correlations between the thermal SZ effect and CIB significantly\ndegrades the SZ constraints. Neglecting this potential correlation, we find the\nthermal SZ power at 150 GHz and ell = 3000 to be 3.65 +/- 0.69 muK^2, and set\nan upper limit on the kinetic SZ power to be less than 2.8 muK^2 at 95%\nconfidence.

The UFG corresponds to a two-component Fermi gas in\nthe limit of short interaction range and large scattering length, and is\ncurrently realized in ultracold-atom experiments via Feshbach resonances. While\neasy to define, the UFG poses a challenging quantum many-body problem, as it\nlacks any characteristic scale other than the density. As a consequence,\naccurate quantitative predictions of the thermodynamic properties of the UFG\nrequire Monte Carlo calculations. However, significant progress has also been\nmade with purely analytical methods. Notably, in 2005 Tan derived a set of\nexact thermodynamic relations in which a universal quantity known as the\n\"contact\" C plays a crucial role. Recently, C has also been found to determine\nthe prefactor of the high- frequency power-law decay of correlators as well as\nthe right-hand-sides of shear- and bulk viscosity sum rules. The contact is\ntherefore a central piece of information on the UFG in equilibrium as well as\naway from equilibrium.

Our goal is to express\n$M$ as $A W$ where $A$ and $W$ are nonnegative matrices of size $n \\times r$\nand $r \\times m$ respectively. In some applications, it makes sense to ask\ninstead for the product $AW$ to approximate $M$ -- i.e. (approximately)\nminimize $\\norm{M - AW}_F$ where $\\norm{}_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm; we\nrefer to this as Approximate NMF. This problem has a rich history spanning\nquantum mechanics, probability theory, data analysis, polyhedral combinatorics,\ncommunication complexity, demography, chemometrics, etc. In the past decade NMF\nhas become enormously popular in machine learning, where $A$ and $W$ are\ncomputed using a variety of local search heuristics. Vavasis proved that this\nproblem is NP-complete. We initiate a study of when this problem is solvable in\npolynomial time:\n  1. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for exact and approximate NMF for\nevery constant $r$. Indeed NMF is most interesting in applications precisely\nwhen $r$ is small.\n  2. We complement this with a hardness result, that if exact NMF can be solved\nin time $(nm)^{o(r)}$, 3-SAT has a sub-exponential time algorithm. This rules\nout substantial improvements to the above algorithm.\n  3. We give an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $n$, $m$ and $r$\nunder the separablity condition identified by Donoho and Stodden in 2003. The\nalgorithm may be practical since it is simple and noise tolerant (under benign\nassumptions). Separability is believed to hold in many practical settings.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this last result is the first example of a\npolynomial-time algorithm that provably works under a non-trivial condition on\nthe input and we believe that this will be an interesting and important\ndirection for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 19:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-04"}

We find that this matter\nentropy is not equal to (it is less than) Wald entropy, except in the case of\nEinstein theory, where they are equal. The matter entropy is proportional to\nthe Wald entropy if we consider a specific m-th order Lanczos-Lovelock model,\nwith the proportionality constant depending on the spacetime dimensions D and\nthe order m of the Lanczos-Lovelock theory as (D-2m)/(D-2). Since the\nproportionality constant depends on m, the proportionality between matter\nentropy and Wald entropy breaks down when we consider a sum of Lanczos-Lovelock\nactions involving different m.

We consider the Euclidean action of\nLanczos-Lovelock models for a class of metrics off-shell and interpret it as a\npartition function. We show that in the case of spherically symmetric metrics,\none can interpret the Euclidean action as the free energy and read off both the\nentropy and energy of a black hole spacetime.

Giant\nclumps of 10^8-9 Msun arise from violent gravitational instability in gas-rich\ngalaxies, and it has been proposed that this instability could feed\nsupermassive black holes (BH). We use emission line diagnostics to compare a\nsample of 14 clumpy (unstable) disks and a sample of 13 smoother (stable) disks\nat redshift z~0.7. The majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a high\nprobability of containing AGN. Their [OIII] emission line is strongly excited,\ninconsistent with low-metallicity star formation alone. [NeIII] excitation is\nalso higher. Stable disks rarely have such properties. Stacking ultra sensitive\nChandra observations (4 Ms) reveals an X-ray excess in clumpy galaxies, which\ncannot be solely due to star formation and confirms the presence of AGN. The\nclumpy galaxies in our intermediate-redshift sample have properties typical of\ngas-rich disk galaxies rather than mergers, being in particular on the Main\nSequence of star formation. This suggests that our findings apply to the\nphysically-similar and numerous gas-rich unstable disks at z>1. Using the\nobserved [OIII] and X-ray luminosities, we conservatively estimate that AGN\nhosted by clumpy disks have typical bolometric luminosities of the order of a\nfew 10^43 erg/s, BH growth rates ~10^-2 Msun/yr, and that these AGN are\nsubstantially obscured in X-rays. This moderate-luminosity mode could be\nsufficient to provide a large fraction of today's BH mass over a couple of Gyr\ngiven that our observations suggest a high duty cycle (>10%), accretion bursts\nwith higher luminosities being possible over shorter phases. The observed\nevolution of disk instabilities with mass and redshift could explain the\nsimultaneous downsizing of star formation and of BH growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 20:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 13:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2012 15:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 13:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 13:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 21:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The\ndegradation of concrete around the dowel negatively affects the latter's\nperformance in terms of transferring wheel loads through vertical shear action.\nIn this context, a nonlinear 3D Finite Element analysis was performed using the\ncommercial FE code Abaqus (v-6.11).

In 2006 the source was identified as one of only a few known\nsymbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs), i.e., systems composed of a neutron star\naccreting from the inhomogeneous medium around an M-giant star. The extremely\nlong pulse period of 5.3 hr is directly visible in the 2008 INTEGRAL-ISGRI\noutburst light curve. The pulse profile is double peaked and generally not\nsignificantly energy dependent although there is an indication of possible\nsoftening during the main pulse. During the outburst a strong spin-up of -1.8\n10^(-4) hr hr^(-1) occurred. Between 2005 and 2008 a long-term spin-down trend\nof 2.1 10^-5 hr hr^(-1) was observed for the first time for this source. The\n3-80 keV pulse peak spectrum of 3A 1954+319 during the 2008 flare could be well\ndescribed by a thermal Comptonization model.

At the core of the BP message updates, when\napplied to a graphical model with pairwise interactions, lies a matrix-vector\nproduct with complexity that is quadratic in the state dimension $d$, and\nrequires transmission of a $(d-1)$-dimensional vector of real numbers\n(messages) to its neighbors. Since various applications involve very large\nstate dimensions, such computation and communication complexities can be\nprohibitively complex. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity variant of\nBP, referred to as stochastic belief propagation (SBP). As suggested by the\nname, it is an adaptively randomized version of the BP message updates in which\neach node passes randomly chosen information to each of its neighbors. The SBP\nmessage updates reduce the computational complexity (per iteration) from\nquadratic to linear in $d$, without assuming any particular structure of the\npotentials, and also reduce the communication complexity significantly,\nrequiring only $\\log{d}$ bits transmission per edge. Moreover, we establish a\nnumber of theoretical guarantees for the performance of SBP, showing that it\nconverges almost surely to the BP fixed point for any tree-structured graph,\nand for graphs with cycles satisfying a contractivity condition. In addition,\nfor these graphical models, we provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the\nconvergence rate, showing that the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm of the error vector\ndecays no slower than $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$ with the number of iterations $t$ on\ntrees and the mean square error decays as $O(1/t)$ for general graphs. These\nanalysis show that SBP can provably yield reductions in computational and\ncommunication complexities for various classes of graphical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 00:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 01:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-28"}

The structure about the Se and Fe sites shows a high\ndegree of order in the nearest neighbor Fe-Se bonds.

First, each transmitter is\nassumed to have a single antenna and serve a singe user in its user group where\neach user has receive antennas less than K. In this case, a K-transmitter\nsingle-input multiple-output (SIMO) interference channel (IC) is constituted\nafter user selection. Without help of multiuser diversity, K-1 interfering\nsignals cannot be perfectly removed at each user since the number of receive\nantennas is smaller than or equal to the number of interferers. Only with\nproper user selection, non-zero DoF per transmitter is achievable as the number\nof users increases. Through geometric interpretation of interfering channels,\nwe show that the multiuser dimensions have to be used first for reducing the\nDoF loss caused by the interfering signals, and then have to be used for\nincreasing the DoF gain from its own signal. The sufficient number of users for\nthe target DoF is derived. We also discuss how the optimal strategy of\nexploiting multiuser diversity can be realized by practical user selection\nschemes.

Cheeger's inequality and its variants provide an approximate version of\nthe latter fact; they state that a graph has a sparse cut if and only if there\nare at least two eigenvalues that are close to zero.\n  It has been conjectured that an analogous characterization holds for higher\nmultiplicities, i.e., there are $k$ eigenvalues close to zero if and only if\nthe vertex set can be partitioned into $k$ subsets, each defining a sparse cut.\nWe resolve this conjecture. Our result provides a theoretical justification for\nclustering algorithms that use the bottom $k$ eigenvectors to embed the\nvertices into $\\mathbb R^k$, and then apply geometric considerations to the\nembedding.\n  We also show that these techniques yield a nearly optimal tradeoff between\nthe expansion of sets of size $\\approx n/k$, and the $k$th smallest eigenvalue\nof the normalized Laplacian matrix, denoted $\\lambda_k$.

One of the best documented perturbations is the\nasymmetry at the top of the inner core (ATIC) characterized by faster seismic\nwave velocity in the eastern hemisphere than in the western hemisphere. All\nexisting explanations are based on a hemispheric variation of the material\nproperties near ICB inside the inner core. Using numerical simulations of the\nseismic ray propagation, we show that the ATIC can be explained as well by the\ndisplacement of the inner core towards east in the equatorial plane tens of\nkilometers from the Earth's center, without modifying the spherical symmetry in\nthe upper inner core. The hypothesis of a displaced inner core is also\nsustained by other observed hemispheric asymmetries at the top of the inner\ncore and at the bottom of the outer core.

At the photometric precision level provided by Kepler, 251 of\nour objects showed no evidence for variability. We were unable to determine\nperiods for 154 variable objects. We find that 79% of stars with T_eff < 5200 K\nare variable. The rotation periods we derive for the periodic variables span\nthe range 0.31 < P_rot < 126.5 d. A considerable number of stars with rotation\nperiods similar to the solar value show activity levels that are 100 times\nhigher than the Sun. This is consistent with results for solar-like field\nstars. As has been found in previous studies, stars with shorter rotation\nperiods generally exhibit larger modulations. This trend flattens beyond P_rot\n= 25 d, demonstrating that even long period binaries may still have components\nwith high levels of activity and investigating whether the masses and radii of\nthe stellar components in these systems are consistent with stellar models\ncould remain problematic. Surprisingly, our modeling of the light curves\nsuggests that the active regions on these cool stars are either preferentially\nlocated near the rotational poles, or that there are two spot groups located at\nlower latitudes, but in opposing hemispheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 14:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It is shown that their huge quantum degeneracy and large\ncorrelation length cause cold dark matter axions to thermalize through\ngravitational self-interactions when the photon temperature reaches\napproximately 500 eV. When they thermalize, the axions form a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. Their thermalization occurs in a regime, herein called the\n`condensed regime', where the Boltzmann equation is not valid because the\nenergy dispersion of the particles is smaller than their interaction rate. We\nderive analytical expressions for the thermalization rate of particles in the\ncondensed regime, and check the validity of these expressions by numerical\nsimulation of a toy model.

It is shown that axions are indistinguishable from\nordinary cold dark matter on all scales of observational interest, except when\nthey thermalize or rethermalize. The rethermalization of axions that are about\nto fall in a galactic potential well causes them to acquire net overall\nrotation as they go to the lowest energy state consistent with the total\nangular momentum they acquired by tidal torquing. This phenomenon explains the\noccurrence of caustic rings of dark matter in galactic halos. We find that\nphotons may reach thermal contact with axions and investigate the implications\nof this possibility for the measurements of cosmological parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 15:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}
