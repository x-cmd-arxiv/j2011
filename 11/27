Examples of equally applicable methods can correspond to those of\ndifferent ancillary statistics in frequentist inference and of different prior\ndistributions in Bayesian inference. More broadly, choices are made between\nparametric and nonparametric methods and between frequentist and Bayesian\nmethods.\n  Rather than choosing a single method, it can be safer, in a game-theoretic\nsense, to combine those that are equally appropriate in light of the available\ninformation. Since methods of combining subjectively assessed probability\ndistributions are not objective enough for that purpose, this paper introduces\na method of distribution combination that does not require any assignment of\ndistribution weights. It does so by formalizing a hedging strategy in terms of\na game between three players: nature, a statistician combining distributions,\nand a statistician refusing to combine distributions. The optimal move of the\nfirst statistician reduces to the solution of a simpler problem of selecting an\nestimating distribution that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler loss maximized over\nthe plausible distributions to be combined. The resulting combined distribution\nis a linear combination of the most extreme of the distributions to be combined\nthat are scientifically plausible. The optimal weights are close enough to each\nother that no extreme distribution dominates the others.\n  The new methodology is illustrated by combining conflicting empirical Bayes\nmethodologies in the context of gene expression data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2011 16:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-30"}

The extended\nrenormalization group equations, which express the invariance of physical\nobservables under both the renormalization scale- and scheme-parameter\ntransformations, provide a convenient way for estimating the scale- and\nscheme-dependence of the physical process. In this paper, we present a solution\nfor the scale-equation of the extended renormalization group equations at the\nfour-loop level. Using the principle of maximum conformality (PMC) /\nBrodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) scale-setting method, all non-conformal\n$\\{\\beta_i\\}$ terms in the perturbative expansion series can be summed into the\nrunning coupling, and the resulting scale-fixed predictions are independent of\nthe renormalization scheme. Different schemes lead to different effective\nPMC/BLM scales, but the final results are scheme independent. Conversely, from\nthe requirement of scheme independence, one not only can obtain\nscheme-independent commensurate scale relations among different observables,\nbut also determine the scale displacements among the PMC/BLM scales which are\nderived under different schemes. In principle, the PMC/BLM scales can be fixed\norder-by-order, and as a useful reference, we present a systematic and\nscheme-independent procedure for setting PMC/BLM scales up to NNLO.

The Discrete Element Method\nsimulates the mechanical behavior of a media formed by a set of particles which\ninteract through their contact points. The difficulty in reproducing vacuum and\nlow-gravity environments makes numerical simulations the most promising\ntechnique in the study of granular media under these conditions. In this work,\nrelevant processes in minor bodies of the Solar System are studied using the\nDiscrete Element Method. Results of simulations of size segregation in\nlow-gravity environments in the cases of the asteroids Eros and Itokawa are\npresented. The segregation of particles with different densities was analysed,\nin particular, the case of comet P/Hartley 2. The surface shaking in these\ndifferent gravity environments could produce the ejection of particles from the\nsurface at very low relative velocities. The shaking causing the above\nprocesses is due to: impacts, explosions like the release of energy by the\nliberation of internal stresses or the re accommodation of material.\nSimulations of the passage of impact-induced seismic waves through a granular\nmedium were also performed. We present several applications of the Discrete\nElement Methods for the study of the physical evolution of agglomerates of\nrocks under low-gravity environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2011 17:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-29"}

Extending our previous works, we present for the first\ntime results from a triaxial joint analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 1835,\nby means of X-ray, strong lensing (SL) and Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) data. We\nparametrically reconstruct the full three-dimensional structure (triaxial shape\nand principal axis orientation) of both the DM and the IC gas, and the level of\nnon-thermal pressure of the IC gas. We find that the intermediate-major and\nminor-major axis ratios of the DM are 0.71+/-0.08 and 0.59+/-0.05,\nrespectively, and the major axis of the DM halo is inclined with respect to the\nline of sight at 18.3+/-5.2 deg. We present the first observational measurement\nof the non-thermal pressure out to R_{200}, which has been evaluated to be a\nfew percent of the total energy budget in the internal regions, while reaching\napproximately 20% in the outer volumes. We discuss the implications of our\nmethod for the viability of the CDM scenario, focusing on the concentration\nparameter C and the inner slope of the DM gamma in order to test the cold dark\nmatter (CDM) paradigm for structure formation: we measure gamma=1.01+/-0.06 and\nC=4.32+/-0.44, values which are close to the predictions of the CDM model. The\ncombination of X-ray/SL data at high spatial resolution, capable of resolving\nthe cluster core, with the SZ data, which are more sensitive to the cluster\nouter volume, allows us to characterize the level and the gradient of the gas\nentropy distribution and non-thermal pressure out to R_{200}, breaking the\ndegeneracy among the physical models describing the thermal history of the ICM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2011 19:37:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 07:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

A large droplet of one phase in the\nsea of the opposite phase eventually disappears. An interesting behavior occurs\nin the intermediate regime when the droplet is still very large compared to the\nlattice spacing, but already very small compared to the initial size. In this\nregime the shape of the droplet is essentially deterministic (fluctuations are\nnegligible in comparison with characteristic size). In two dimensions the shape\nis also universal, that is, independent on the initial shape. We analytically\ndetermine the limiting shape of the Ising droplet on the square lattice. When\nthe initial state is a semi-infinite stripe of one phase in the sea of the\nopposite phase, it evolves into a finger which translates along its axis. We\ndetermine the limiting shape and the velocity of the Ising finger on the square\nlattice. An analog of the Ising finger on the cubic lattice is the translating\nIsing soliton. We show that far away from the tip, the cross-section of the\nIsing soliton coincides with the limiting shape of the two-dimensional Ising\ndroplet and we determine a relation between the cross-section area, the\ndistance from the tip, and the velocity of the soliton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2011 01:11:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 22:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-12"}

The pressure dependent variation of the Ag and\nB2g bending modes from the O-Ce-O unit is suppressed when the proton conductor\nis hydrated, affecting directly the proton transfer by locally changing the\nelectron density of the oxygen ions. Compressive strain causes a hardening of\nthe Ce-O stretching bond. The activation barrier for proton conductivity is\nraised, in line with recent findings using high pressure and high temperature\nimpedance spectroscopy. The increasing Raman frequency of the B1g and B3g modes\nthus implies that the phonons become hardened and increase the vibration energy\nin the a-c crystal plane upon compressive strain, whereas phonons are relaxed\nin the b-axis, and thus reveal softening of the Ag and B2g modes. Lattice\ntoughening in the a-c crystal plane raises therefore a higher activation\nbarrier for proton transfer and thus anisotropic conductivity. The experimental\nfindings of the interaction of protons with the ceramic host lattice under\nexternal strain may provide a general guideline for yet to develop epitaxial\nstrained proton conducting thin film systems with high proton mobility and low\nactivation energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2011 01:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-29"}

Many efforts have been made to seek tight luminosity\nrelations. With the latest sample of 116 GRBs with measured redshift and\nspectral parameters, we investigate 6 two-dimensional (2D) correlations and 14\nderived three-dimensional (3D) correlations of GRBs to explore the possibility\nof decreasing the intrinsic scatters of the luminosity relations of GRBs.

In addition, the coefficients before\nthe logarithms of $E_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ in the\n$E_{\\mathrm{peak}}$--$\\tau_{\\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$ correlation are almost exact\nopposites of each other.

This is achieved by using Python for most of the code while\nemploying automatically-wrapped Fortran kernels for computationally intensive\nroutines, and using Python bindings to interface with a parallel computing\nlibrary and other numerical packages. The software described here is PyClaw, a\nPython-based structured grid solver for general systems of hyperbolic PDEs\n\\cite{pyclaw}. PyClaw provides a powerful and intuitive interface to the\nalgorithms of the existing Fortran codes Clawpack and SharpClaw, simplifying\ncode development and use while providing massive parallelism and scalable\nsolvers via the PETSc library. The package is further augmented by use of\nPyWENO for generation of efficient high-order weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory reconstruction code.

When loaded by external\nstresses, their internal strains are governed by correlated motion of internal\nstructural degrees of freedom. The modelling of such materials is mainly based\non ordered structures, despite existence of auxetic behaviour in disordered\nstructures and the advantage in manufacturing disordered structures for most\napplications. We describe here a first-principles expression for strains in\ndisordered such materials, based on insight from a family of 'iso-auxetic'\nstructures. These are structures, consisting of internal structural elements,\nwhich we name 'auxetons', whose inter-element forces can be computed from\nstatics alone. Iso-auxetic structures make it possible not only to identify the\nmechanisms that give rise to auxeticity, but also to write down the explicit\ndependence of the strain rate on the local structure, which is valid to all\nauxetic materials. It is argued that stresses give rise to strains via two\nmechanisms: auxeton rotations and auxeton expansion / contraction. The former\ndepends on the stress via a local fabric tensor, which we define explicitly for\n2D systems. The latter depends on the stress via an expansion tensor. Whether a\nmaterial exhibits auxetic behaviour or not depends on the interplay between\nthese two fields. This description has two major advantages: it applies to any\nauxeton-based system, however disordered, and it goes beyond conventional\nelasticity theory, providing an explicit expression for general auxetic strains\nand outlining the relevant equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2011 22:18:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 12:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-16"}
