The sample is\ncomposed of 33 sources: 15 are newly discovered above 20 keV while 18 are\nalready known AGN. For 17 sources we have performed a broadband analysis with\nXMM and INTEGRAL data. We have complemented the analysis of the 16 remaining\nsources with existing broadband studies. The spectra are well reproduced with\nan absorbed primary emission with a high energy cutoff and its scattered\nfraction below 2-3 keV, plus the Compton reflection features. A high energy\ncut-off is found in 30% of the sample, with an average value below 150 keV. The\nhard X-ray selection favours the detection of more obscured sources, with the\nlog NH average value of 23.15. The diagnostic plot NH vs\nF(corr)(2-10keV)/F(20-100keV) allowed the isolation of the Compton thick\nobjects and may represent a useful tool for future hard X-ray observations of\nnewly discovered AGN. We are unable to associate the reflection components\n(continuum and Fe line) with the absorbing gas as a torus, a more complex\nscenario being necessary. In the Compton thin sources, a fraction (but not all)\nof the Fe line needs to be produced in a gas located closer to the BH than the\nthick torus, and this is possibly associated with the optical BLR, responsible\nalso for the absorption. We still need a Compton thick medium (not intercepting\nthe line of sight) likely associated to a torus, which contributes to the Fe\nline and produces the observed reflection continuum above 10 keV. The\nIwasawa-Taniguchi effect can not be confirmed with our data. Finally, the\ncomparison with a sample of unobscured AGN shows that, type 1 and type 2 (once\ncorrected for absorption) Seyfert are characterized by the same\nnuclear/accretion properties (luminosity, bolometric luminosity, Eddington\nratio), supporting the unified view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 16:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The resulting sparse\nrepresentations have been shown to possess robustness against a variety of\ndistortions like random pixel corruption, occlusion and disguise. This approach\nhowever makes the restrictive (in many scenarios) assumption that test faces\nmust be perfectly aligned (or registered) to the training data prior to\nclassification. In this paper, we propose a simple yet robust local block-based\nsparsity model, using adaptively-constructed dictionaries from local features\nin the training data, to overcome this misalignment problem. Our approach is\ninspired by human perception: we analyze a series of local discriminative\nfeatures and combine them to arrive at the final classification decision. We\npropose a probabilistic graphical model framework to explicitly mine the\nconditional dependencies between these distinct sparse local features. In\nparticular, we learn discriminative graphs on sparse representations obtained\nfrom distinct local slices of a face. Conditional correlations between these\nsparse features are first discovered (in the training phase), and subsequently\nexploited to bring about significant improvements in recognition rates.\nExperimental results obtained on benchmark face databases demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the presence of multiple\nregistration errors (such as translation, rotation, and scaling) as well as\nunder variations of pose and illumination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 16:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

Here we introduce a new route to enhancing necessary conditions\nfor $N$-representability through rank restriction of the 2-RDM. Rather than\nadding computationally more expensive $N$-representability conditions, we\ndirectly enhance the accuracy of two-particle (2-positivity) conditions through\nrank restriction, which removes degrees of freedom in the 2-RDM that are not\nsufficiently constrained. We select the rank of the particle-hole 2-RDM by\nderiving the ranks associated with model wavefunctions including both\nmean-field and antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wave functions. Because the\n2-positivity conditions are exact for quantum systems with AGP ground states,\nthe rank of the particle-hole 2-RDM from the AGP ansatz provides a minimum for\nits value in variational 2-RDM calculations of general quantum systems. To\nimplement the rank-restricted conditions, we extend a first-order algorithm for\nlarge-scale semidefinite programming. The rank-restricted conditions\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of the energies; for example, the\npercentages of correlation energies recovered for HF, CO, and N$_{2}$ improve\nfrom 115.2%, 121.7%, and 121.5% without rank restriction to 97.8%, 101.1%, and\n100.0% with rank restriction.

For the class of strict\nGFN models we define a state-dependent Lyapunov and show that a converse\nLyapunov theorem holds.

In the limit of large connectivity on the Bethe\nlattice, the hopping can be treated by constructing a self-consistent effective\naction for a single node. This procedure is akin to dynamical mean field\ntheory, but generalized so that spatial as well as quantum fluctuations are\ntaken into account on each node. The quantum phase transition is studied using\nthis effective action for both infinite and finite N. The importance of the\nPerron-Frobenius uniform mode on the Bethe lattice is discussed, and its\nelimination via an \"infinite range hopping\" term shifts the transition, leading\nto nontrivial critical behavior. We calculate critical exponents and find that\nthe internode hopping reduces the upper and lower critical dimensions each by\none, indicating that--at least for the purposes of quantum criticality--the\nlarge number of internode couplings is similar to adding a single extra\ndimension to the theory describing a single node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 18:48:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 12:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

We assume that communities are fundamentally\ndefined by the repetition of interactions among a set of nodes over time.\nAccording to this definition, analyzing the data by considering successive\nsnapshots induces a significant loss of information: we suggest that it blurs\nessentially dynamic phenomena - such as communities based on repeated\ninter-temporal interactions, nodes switching from a community to another across\ntime, or the possibility that a community survives while its members are being\nintegrally replaced over a longer time period.

In this paper, a\nconnection between the gamma-ray and optical variability of 3C345 and\nproperties of its parsec-scale radio emission is investigated. Methods: The\nFermi-LAT data of 3C345, covering an energy range of 0.1-300 GeV, were combined\nwith 32 Very Long Baseline Array observations of the object made at 43.2 GHz in\nthe period of January 2008 - March 2010. Results: The VLBA data reveal\nmorphology and kinematics of the flow on scales of up to ~5 milliarcseconds\n(mas; deprojected linear distances of 380 parsecs). The brightness temperature,\nT_b(r), measured along the jet first decreases with distance proportional to\nr^-(0.95 +/-0.69) and later exhibits a break at ~0.3 mas, with T_b(r)\nproportional to r^-(4.11 +/-0.85) at larger separations. Variations of the\ngamma-ray, optical and parsec-scale radio emission show a similar long-term\ntrend persistent during the entire VLBA monitoring period. The gamma-ray and\noptical variations on shorter time scales are related to structural changes in\nthe jet on scales of ~0.3 mas (~23 parsecs, deprojected), with the gamma-ray\nand optical flares possibly related to the evolution of four distinct\nsuperluminal components identified in the flow. Conclusions: The observations\nindicate that both the quiescent and flaring components of the gamma-ray\nemission are produced in a region of the jet of ~23 pc in extent. This region\nmay mark the Compton-loss dominated zone of the flow and its large extent may\nfavor the synchrotron self-Compton mechanism for gamma-ray production in the\nrelativistic jet of the quasar 3C345.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

While the\nbest-fitting hosts of the dwarf spheroidals all have 12 < Vmax < 25 km/s, LCDM\nsimulations predict at least ten subhalos with Vmax > 25 km/s. These subhalos\nare also among the most massive at earlier times, and significantly exceed the\nUV suppression mass back to z ~ 10. No LCDM-based model of the satellite\npopulation of the Milky Way explains this result. The problem lies in the\nsatellites' densities: it is straightforward to match the observed Milky Way\nluminosity function, but doing so requires the dwarf spheroidals to have dark\nmatter halos that are a factor of ~5 more massive than is observed. Independent\nof the difficulty in explaining the absence of these dense, massive subhalos,\nthere is a basic tension between the derived properties of the bright Milky Way\ndwarf spheroidals and LCDM expectations. The inferred infall masses of these\ngalaxies are all approximately equal and are much lower than standard LCDM\npredictions for systems with their luminosities. Consequently, their implied\nstar formation efficiencies span over two orders of magnitude, from 0.2% to 20%\nof baryons converted into stars, in stark contrast with expectations gleaned\nfrom more massive galaxies. We explore possible solutions to these problems\nwithin the context of LCDM and find them to be unconvincing.

We use a simple model to describe the\ngrowth of the dust grains under the hypothesis of a time-independent,\nspherically symmetric stellar wind. We find that the total mass of dust\ninjected by AGB stars in the interstellar medium does not increase\nmonotonically with stellar mass and ranges between a minimum of 10^{-6}Msun for\nthe 1.5Msun stellar model, up to 2x10^{-4} Msun, for the 6Msun case. Dust\ncomposition depends on the stellar mass: low-mass stars (M < 3Msun) produce\ncarbon-rich dust, whereas more massive stars, experiencing Hot Bottom Burning,\nnever reach the carbon-star stage, and produce silicates and iron. This is in\npartial disagreement with previous investigations in the literature, which are\nbased on synthetic AGB models and predict that, when the initial metallicity is\nZ=0.001, C-rich dust is formed at all stellar masses. The differences are due\nto the different modelling of turbulent convection in the super-adiabaticity\nregime.

If short cycles are not so un- common, we expect to\ndetect many of them with missions such as CoRoT, Kepler, and possibly the PLATO\nmission. We will review some of the latest results obtained with spectroscopic\nmeasurements. We will show how asteroseismology can help us to better\nunderstand the complex process of dynamo and illustrate how the CoRoT and\nKepler missions are revolutionizing our knowledge on stellar activity. A new\nwindow is being opened over our understanding of the magnetic variability of\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 21:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

A\nsimple probabilistic model for the output of an EMCCD is developed.

However, large\ncoalescing islands can also generate, in the middle of these stochastic\nregions, KAM surfaces effectively acting as \"barriers\" against field-line\ndispersion and, indirectly, particle diffusion.

These\nsimulations have mostly been run with a source beam outside the detector. In\nthe case of low-background physics, however, a primary concern is the effect on\nthe detector from radioactivity inherent in the detector parts themselves. From\nthis standpoint, there is no single source or beam, but rather a collection of\nsources with potentially complicated spatial extent. LUXSim is a simulation\nframework used by the LUX collaboration that takes a component-centric approach\nto event generation and recording. A new set of classes allows for multiple\nradioactive sources to be set within any number of components at run time, with\nthe entire collection of sources handled within a single simulation run.\nVarious levels of information can also be recorded from the individual\ncomponents, with these record levels also being set at runtime. This\nflexibility in both source generation and information recording is possible\nwithout the need to recompile, reducing the complexity of code management and\nthe proliferation of versions. Within the code itself, casting geometry objects\nwithin this new set of classes rather than as the default Geant4 classes\nautomatically extends this flexibility to every individual component. No\nadditional work is required on the part of the developer, reducing development\ntime and increasing confidence in the results.

In\nparticular, we consider different types of interactions including screened\nCoulomb interactions, much like those produced by a point charge placed either\nabove a single infinite conducting plate or exactly halfway between two\nparallel infinite conducting plates. Our considerations are motivated by the\nfact that, in some recent experiments on bilayer graphene there is a single\ngate while in others there are two gates, which can function as the conducting\nplanes and which, we argue, can lead to distinct broken symmetry phases. We map\nout the phases that the system enters as a function of the range of the\ninteraction. We discover that the system enters an antiferromagnetic phase for\nshort ranges of the interaction and a nematic phase at long ranges, in\nagreement with previous work. While the antiferromagnetic phase results in a\ngap in the spectrum, the nematic phase is gapless, splitting the quadratic\ndegeneracy points into two Dirac cones each.

They constitute the\nparaneutrino of true neutrality, for example, at the neutrino interaction with\na spinless nucleus of an axial-vector current.

Molecular dissociations\nupon compression as one of the fundamental problems were reported for other\ndiatomic solids (e.g., H2, I2, Br2, and N2), but it remains elusive for solid\noxygen, making oxygen an intractable system. We here report the theoretical\nprediction on the dissociation of molecular oxygen into a polymeric spiral\nchain O4 structure (\\theta-O4) by using first-principles calypso method on\ncrystal structure prediction. The \\theta-O4 stabilizes above 2 TPa and has been\nobserved as the third high pressure phase of sulfur (S-III). We find that the\nmolecular O8 phase remains extremely stable in a large pressure range of 0.008\n- 2 TPa, whose breakdown is driven by the pressure-induced instability of a\ntransverse acoustic phonon mode at zone boundary, leading to the ultimate\nformation of \\theta-O4. Remarkably, stabilization of \\theta-O4 turns oxygen\nfrom a superconductor into an insulator with a wide band gap (approximately 5.9\neV) originating from the sp3-like hybridized orbitals of oxygen and the\nlocalization of valence electrons.

If the accretion rate allows a sufficiently large\nmass of He to accumulate prior to ignition of nuclear burning, the He surface\nlayer may detonate, giving rise to an astrophysical transient. Detonation of\nthe He layer generates shock waves that propagate into the underlying CO WD.\nThis might directly ignite a detonation at the edge of the CO WD or compress\nthe core of the WD sufficiently to trigger a CO detonation near the centre. If\neither ignition mechanism works, the two detonations can release sufficient\nenergy to completely unbind the WD. Here we extend our 2D studies of this\ndouble-detonation model to low-mass CO WDs. We investigate the feasibility of\ntriggering a secondary core detonation by shock convergence in low-mass CO WDs\nand the observable consequences of such a detonation. Our results suggest that\ncore detonation is probable, even for the lowest CO core masses realized in\nnature. We compute spectra and light curves for models in which either an\nedge-lit or compression-triggered CO detonation is assumed to occur and compare\nthese to models in which no CO detonation was allowed to occur. If significant\nshock compression of the CO WD occurs prior to detonation, explosion of the CO\nWD can produce a sufficiently large mass of radioactive iron-group nuclei to\naffect the light curves. In particular, this can lead to relatively slow\npost-maximum decline. If the secondary detonation is edge-lit, however, the CO\nWD explosion primarily yields intermediate-mass elements that affect the\nobservables more subtly. In this case, NIR observations and detailed\nspectroscopic analysis would be needed to determine whether core detonation\noccurred.

In this era\nof global positioning system equipped smartphones, however, a user's ability to\naccess local geometric information and find efficient pathways on networks\nplays a crucial role, rather than the globally optimal pathways. We present a\nsimple greedy spatial navigation strategy as a probe to explore spatial\nnetworks. These greedy navigators use directional information in every move\nthey take, without being trapped in a dead end based on their memory about\nprevious routes. We suggest that the centralities measures have to be modified\nto incorporate the navigators' behavior, and present the intriguing effect of\nnavigators' greediness where removing some edges may actually enhance the\nrouting efficiency, which is reminiscent of Braess's paradox. In addition,\nusing samples of road structures in large cities around the world, it is shown\nthat the navigability measure we define reflects unique structural properties,\nwhich are not easy to predict from other topological characteristics. In this\nrespect, we believe that our routing scheme significantly moves the routing\nproblem on networks one step closer to reality, incorporating the inevitable\nincompleteness of navigators' information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 08:07:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 19:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 14:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 09:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-18"}

Rev. E 82, 021921 (2010)] a simple mechanism was\npresented by which a molecule subjected to forced oscillations, out of thermal\nequilibrium, can maintain quantum entanglement between two of its quantum\ndegrees of freedom. Crucially, entanglement can be maintained even in the\npresence of very intense noise, so intense that no entanglement is possible\nwhen the forced oscillations cease. This mechanism may allow for the presence\nof non-trivial quantum entanglement in biological systems. Here we\nsignificantly enlarge the study of this model.

In particular, by considering inputs consisting of just a path and\nisolated vertices, we proved that any monotone switching network solving\ndirected connectivity on $N$ vertices must have size at least\n$N^{\\Omega(\\lg(N))}$ and this bound is tight. If we could show a similar result\nfor general switching networks solving directed connectivity, then this would\nprove that $L \\neq NL$.

For star-forming galaxies (sBzKs), the UV-based SFR, corrected for\nextinction, scales with the stellar mass as SFR ~ M_{*}^{alpha} with alpha =\n0.74+/-0.20 down to M_{*} ~ 10^{9} M_{solar}, indicating a weak dependence on\nthe stellar mass of the SSFR. We also measure the angular correlation function\nand hence infer the correlation length for sBzK galaxies as a function of\nM_{*}, SFR, and SSFR, as well as K-band apparent magnitude. We show that\npassive galaxies (pBzKs) are more strongly clustered than sBzK galaxies at a\ngiven stellar mass, mirroring the color-density relation seen at lower\nredshifts. We also find that the correlation length of sBzK galaxies ranges\nfrom 4 to 20 h^{-1}Mpc, being a strong function of M_{K}, M_{*}, and SFR. On\nthe other hand, the clustering dependence on SSFR changes abruptly at 2x10^{-9}\nyr^{-1}, which is the typical value for \"main sequence\" star-forming galaxies\nat z~2. We show that the correlation length reaches a minimum at this\ncharacteristic value, and is larger for galaxies with both smaller and larger\nSSFRs; a dichotomy that is only marginally implied from the predictions of the\nsemi-analytical models. Our results suggest that there are two types of\nenvironmental effects at work at z~2. Stronger clustering for relatively\nquiescent galaxies implies that the environment has started to play a role in\nquenching star formation. At the same time, stronger clustering for galaxies\nwith elevated SSFRs (\"starbursts\") might be attributed to an increased\nefficiency for galaxy interactions and mergers in dense environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 08:49:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 09:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

The main advantage is the\npossibility of exploiting well established technologies originally developed\nfor LBM and classical computational fluid dynamics, with special emphasis on\nfinite differences (at least in the present paper), at the cost of minor\nchanges. For instance, wall boundaries not aligned with the background\nCartesian mesh can be taken into account by tracing the intersections of each\nlink with the wall (analogously to LBM technology). LW-ACM requires no\nhigh-order moments beyond hydrodynamics (often referred to as ghost moments)\nand no kinetic expansion. Like finite difference schemes, only standard Taylor\nexpansion is needed for analyzing consistency. Preliminary efforts towards\noptimal implementations have shown that LW-ACM is capable of similar\ncomputational speed as optimized (BGK-) LBM. In addition, the memory demand is\nsignificantly smaller than (BGK-) LBM. Importantly, with an efficient\nimplementation, this algorithm may be one of the few which is compute-bound and\nnot memory-bound.

To minimize overall transmitted power, we propose a novel\nadaptive subcarrier and bit allocation algorithm based on channel state\ninformation (CSI) and quality state information (QSI). A suboptimal approach\nthat separately performs subcarrier allocation and bit loading is proposed. It\nis shown that a near optimal solution is obtained by the proposed algorithm\nwhich has low complexity compared to that of other conventional algorithm. We\nwill study the problem of finding an optimal sub-carrier and power allocation\nstrategy for downlink communication to multiple users in an OFDMA based\nwireless system. Assuming knowledge of the instantaneous channel gains for all\nusers, we propose a multiuser OFDMA subcarrier, and bit allocation algorithm to\nminimize the total transmit power.

An additional weak and heavily-damped excitation is seen in the spectra of\ncomplex dielectric permittivity epsilon_c within the same frequency range.

In one dimension, once the underlying L\\'evy process\nhas been specified, the GLM has four parameters: the initial price, the\ninterest rate, the volatility, and the risk aversion. The pricing kernel is the\nproduct of a discount factor and a risk aversion martingale. For GBM, the risk\naversion parameter is the market price of risk. For a GLM, this interpretation\nis not valid: the excess rate of return is a nonlinear function of the\nvolatility and the risk aversion. It is shown that for positive volatility and\nrisk aversion the excess rate of return above the interest rate is positive,\nand is increasing with respect to these variables.

By the variability\ncharacteristics IRAS 19336-0400 appears similar to other hot proto-planetary\nnebulae. Based on low-resolution spectra in the range lambda 4000-7500 A we\nhave derived absolute intensities of the emission lines H_alpha, H_beta,\nH_gamma, [SII], [NII], physical conditions in gaseous nebula: n_e=10^4 cm^{-3},\nT_e=7000 \\pm 1000 K. The emission line H_alpha, H_beta equivalent widths are\nfound to be considerably variable and related to light changes. By\nUBV-photometry and spectroscopy the color excess has been estimated:\nE_{B-V}=0.50-0.54.

Recently, this was settled\nby the present authors (Kratsch and Wahlstr\\\"om, SODA 2012), with a randomized\npolynomial kernel for the problem, using matroid theory to encode flow\nquestions over a set of terminals in size polynomial in the number of\nterminals.\n  In the current work we further establish the usefulness of matroid theory to\nkernelization by showing applications of a result on representative sets due to\nLov\\'asz (Combinatorial Surveys 1977) and Marx (TCS 2009). We show how\nrepresentative sets can be used to give a polynomial kernel for the elusive\nAlmost 2-SAT problem.

This\ngives the first significant progress towards a polynomial kernel for the\nMultiway Cut problem; in particular, we get a kernel of O(k^{s+1}) vertices for\nMultiway Cut instances with at most s terminals. Both these kernelization\nresults have significant spin-off effects, producing the first polynomial\nkernels for a range of related problems.\n  More generally, the irrelevant vertex results have implications for covering\nmin-cuts in graphs.

High\nredshift quasars also show similar CO and H2O line properties, while starburst\ngalaxies, such as M82, lack these very strong H2O lines in the same wavelength\nrange, but do show strong CO lines. We explore the possibility of enhancing the\ngas phase H2O abundance in X-ray exposed environments, using bare interstellar\ncarbonaceous dust grains as a catalyst. Cloud-cloud collisions cause C and J\nshocks, and strip the grains of their ice layers. The internal UV field created\nby X-rays from the accreting black hole does not allow to reform the ice. We\ndetermine formation rates of both OH and H2O on dust grains, having temperature\nT_dust=10-60 K, using both Monte Carlo as well as rate equation method\nsimulations. The acquired formation rates are added to our X-ray chemistry\ncode, that allows us to calculate the thermal and chemical structure of the\ninterstellar medium near an active galactic nucleus. We derive analytic\nexpressions for the formation of OH and H2O on bare dust grains as a catalyst.\nOxygen atoms arriving on the dust are released into the gas phase under the\nform of OH and H2O. The efficiencies of this conversion due to the chemistry\noccurring on dust are of order 30 percent for oxygen converted into OH and 60\npercent for oxygen converted into H_2O between T_dust=15-40 K. At higher\ntemperatures, the efficiencies rapidly decline. When the gas is mostly atomic,\nmolecule formation on dust is dominant over the gas-phase route, which is then\nquenched by the low H2 abundance. Here, it is possible to enhance the warm (T>\n200 K) water abundance by an order of magnitude in X-ray exposed environments.\nThis helps to explain the observed bright water lines in nearby and\nhigh-redshift ULIRGs and Quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 13:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Consequently, the hopping parameters can vanish and\neven change sign, in an anisotropic manner, thus yielding different band\nstructures. Here, we study the merging and the alignment of Dirac points and\ndimensional crossovers from the two dimensional system to one dimensional\nchains and zero dimensional dimers. We also consider next-nearest-neighbor\nhopping, which breaks the particle-hole symmetry and leads to a metallic phase\nwhen it becomes dominant over the nearest-neighbor hopping. Furthermore, we\ninclude weak repulsive on-site interactions and find the density profiles for\ndifferent values of the hopping parameters and interactions, both in a\nhomogeneous system and in the presence of a trapping potential. Our results may\nbe experimentally observed by using momentum-resolved Raman spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 14:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 09:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

So far, the studies or applications of multivariate probabilistic\nmodel based continuous EDAs are still restricted to rather low dimensional\nproblems (smaller than 100D). Traditional EDAs have difficulties in solving\nhigher dimensional problems because of the curse of dimensionality and their\nrapidly increasing computational cost. However, scaling up continuous EDAs for\nhigher dimensional optimization is still necessary, which is supported by the\ndistinctive feature of EDAs: Because a probabilistic model is explicitly\nestimated, from the learnt model one can discover useful properties or features\nof the problem. Besides obtaining a good solution, understanding of the problem\nstructure can be of great benefit, especially for black box optimization. We\npropose a novel EDA framework with Model Complexity Control (EDA-MCC) to scale\nup EDAs. By using Weakly dependent variable Identification (WI) and Subspace\nModeling (SM), EDA-MCC shows significantly better performance than traditional\nEDAs on high dimensional problems. Moreover, the computational cost and the\nrequirement of large population sizes can be reduced in EDA-MCC. In addition to\nbeing able to find a good solution, EDA-MCC can also produce a useful problem\nstructure characterization. EDA-MCC is the first successful instance of\nmultivariate model based EDAs that can be effectively applied a general class\nof up to 500D problems. It also outperforms some newly developed algorithms\ndesigned specifically for large scale optimization. In order to understand the\nstrength and weakness of EDA-MCC, we have carried out extensive computational\nstudies of EDA-MCC.

More concretely, we\ndevelop frameworks for the specification of anonymity properties and propose\nalgorithms for their verification. Since in practice anonymity protocols always\nleak some information, we focus on quantitative properties, which capture the\namount of information leaked by a protocol.\n  The main contribution of this thesis is cpCTL, the first temporal logic that\nallows for the specification and verification of conditional probabilities\n(which are the key ingredient of most anonymity properties). In addition, we\nhave considered several prominent definitions of information-leakage and\ndeveloped the first algorithms allowing us to compute (and even approximate)\nthe information leakage of anonymity protocols according to these definitions.\nWe have also studied a well-known problem in the specification and analysis of\ndistributed anonymity protocols, namely full-information scheduling. To\novercome this problem, we have proposed an alternative notion of scheduling and\nadjusted accordingly several anonymity properties from the literature. Our last\nmajor contribution is a debugging technique that helps on the detection of\nflaws in security protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 15:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-14"}
