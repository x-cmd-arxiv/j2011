We present a method to\nanalyze this dependence on ellipticity, deriving a probability distribution of\nRydberg states that agrees closely with recent experimental [1] and numerical\nresults. In particular, contradicting the existing proposed mechanism [1] and\ngeneral expectations, our results indicate that the dependence of Rydberg yield\non laser ellipticity is not caused by a rescattering process.

First, we point out that in most real,\npractical situations, where the concept of device-independence is used as a\nprotection against unintentional flaws or failures of the quantum apparatuses,\nit is sufficient to show that the generated string is random with respect to an\nadversary that holds only classical-side information, i.e., proving randomness\nagainst quantum-side information is not necessary. Furthermore, the initial\nrandom seed does not need to be private with respect to the adversary, provided\nthat it is generated in a way that is independent from the measured systems.\nThe devices, though, will generate cryptographically-secure randomness that\ncannot be predicted by the adversary and thus one can, given access to free\npublic randomness, talk about private randomness generation.\n  The theoretical tools to quantify the generated randomness according to these\ncriteria were already introduced in [S. Pironio et al, Nature 464, 1021\n(2010)], but the final results were improperly formulated. The second aim of\nthis paper is to correct this inaccurate formulation and therefore lay out a\nprecise theoretical framework for practical device-independent randomness\nexpansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 17:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 08:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 20:56:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 14:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 21:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-31"}

The\neffects that channel noise can have on neural dynamics are generally studied\nusing numerical simulations of stochastic models. Algorithms based on discrete\nMarkov Chains (MC) seem to be the most reliable and trustworthy, but even\noptimized algorithms come with a non-negligible computational cost. Diffusion\nApproximation (DA) methods use Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) to\napproximate the behavior of a number of MCs, considerably speeding up\nsimulation times.

Recently, it was shown that the\ndifference arose because MCs were modeled with coupled activation subunits,\nwhile the DA was modeled using uncoupled activation subunits. Implementations\nof DA with coupled subunits, in the context of a specific kinetic scheme,\nyielded similar results to MC. However, it remained unclear how to generalize\nthese implementations to different kinetic schemes, or whether they were faster\nthan MC algorithms. Additionally, a steady state approximation was used for the\nstochastic terms, which, as we show here, can introduce significant\ninaccuracies.

Our motivation stems from the observation that most\nalgorithms proposed for online convex optimization require a projection onto\nthe convex set $\\mathcal{K}$ from which the decisions are made. While for\nsimple shapes (e.g. Euclidean ball) the projection is straightforward, for\narbitrary complex sets this is the main computational challenge and may be\ninefficient in practice. In this paper, we consider an alternative online\nconvex optimization problem. Instead of requiring decisions belong to\n$\\mathcal{K}$ for all rounds, we only require that the constraints which define\nthe set $\\mathcal{K}$ be satisfied in the long run. We show that our framework\ncan be utilized to solve a relaxed version of online learning with side\nconstraints addressed in \\cite{DBLP:conf/colt/MannorT06} and\n\\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/KvetonYTM08}.

Then we\nmodify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied\nin the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on\nthe Mirror Prox method \\citep{nemirovski-2005-prox} to solve variational\ninequalities which achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{\\mathcal{O}}}(T^{2/3})$ bound for\nboth regret and the violation of constraints when the domain $\\K$ can be\ndescribed by a finite number of linear constraints.

Each predicts a range of radioactive powers, overlapping\nslightly with the other at about 24 TW, and together spanning 14-46 TW.\nApproximately 20 % of this radioactive power (3-8 TW) escapes to space in the\nform of geo-neutrinos. The remaining 11-38 TW heats the planet with significant\ngeo-dynamical consequences, appearing as the radiogenic component of the 43-49\nTW surface heat flow. The non-radiogenic component of the surface heat flow\n(5-38 TW) is presumably primordial, a legacy of the formation and early\nevolution of the planet. A constraining measurement of radiogenic heating\nprovides insights to the thermal history of the Earth and potentially\ndiscriminates chemical and physical Earth models. Radiogenic heating in the\nplanet primarily springs from unstable nuclides of uranium, thorium, and\npotassium. The paths to their stable daughter nuclides include nuclear beta\ndecays, producing geo-neutrinos. Large sub-surface detectors efficiently record\nthe energy but not the direction of the infrequent interactions of the highest\nenergy geo-neutrinos, originating only from uranium and thorium. The measured\nenergy spectrum of the interactions estimates the relative amounts of these\nheat-producing elements, while the intensity estimates planetary radiogenic\npower. Recent geo-neutrino observations in Japan and Italy find consistent\nvalues of radiogenic heating.

We analyze the order of the deconfining phase\ntransition when different deformation terms are used. After finding order\nparameters for the global symmetries, we show that there are four distinct\nphases: a deconfined phase, a confined phase, a Higgs phase, and a mixed\nconfined phase.

Algorithms currently envisioned to handle IFS data, such\nas the Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI) algorithm, rely upon\naggressive point-spread-function (PSF) subtraction, which is ideal for\ninitially identifying companions but results in significantly biased photometry\nand spectroscopy due to unwanted mixing with residual starlight. This\nspectro-photometric issue is further complicated by the fact that algorithmic\ncolor response is a function of the companion's spectrum, making it difficult\nto calibrate the effects of the reduction without using iterations involving a\nseries of injected synthetic companions. In this paper, we introduce a new PSF\ncalibration method, which we call \"damped LOCI\", that seeks to alleviate these\nconcerns. By modifying the cost function that determines the weighting\ncoefficients used to construct PSF reference images, and also forcing those\ncoefficients to be positive, it is possible to extract companion spectra with a\nprecision that is set by calibration of the instrument response and\ntransmission of the atmosphere, and not by post-processing. We demonstrate the\nutility of this approach using on-sky data obtained with the Project 1640 IFS\nat Palomar. Damped-LOCI does not require any iterations on the underlying\nspectral type of the companion, nor does it rely upon priors involving the\nchromatic and statistical properties of speckles. It is a general technique\nthat can readily be applied to other current and planned instruments that\nemploy IFS's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 20:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Within\nthis context, radiative signatures of dissipation of kinetic and conversion of\nmagnetic energy in internal shocks of relativistic magnetized outflows are\nstudied. We model internal shocks as being caused by collisions of homogeneous\nplasma shells. We compute the flow state after the shell interaction by solving\nRiemann problems at the contact surface between the colliding shells, and then\ncompute the emission from the resulting shocks. Under the assumption of a\nconstant flow luminosity we find that there is a clear difference between the\nmodels where both shells are weakly magne- tized ({\\sigma}<\\sim0.01) and those\nwhere, at least, one shell has a {\\sigma}>\\sim0.01. We obtain that the\nradiative efficiency is largest for models in which, regardless of the\nordering, one shell is weakly and the other strongly magnetized. Substantial\ndifferences between weakly and strongly magne- tized shell collisions are\nobserved in the inverse-Compton part of the spectrum, as well as in the\noptical, X-ray and 1GeV light curves. We propose a way to distinguish\nobservationally between weakly magnetized from magnetized internal shocks by\ncomparing the maximum frequency of the inverse-Compton and synchrotron part of\nthe spectrum to the ratio of the inverse-Compton and synchrotron fluence.\nFinally, our results suggest that LBL blazars may correspond to barely\nmagnetized flows, while HBL blazars could correspond to moderately magnetized\nones.

In order to define the character of the motion in the 2D\nsystem, we use the classical method of the Poincare x-px phase plane, the\nLyapunov Characteristic Exponent (LCE) and the dynamical parameter - the S(c)\nspectrum. Then the results obtained from the 2D system are used to investigate\nthe properties of the 3D system.

Numerical experiments conducted by the new S(k) spectrum suggest\nthat the different chaotic components in the 3D system do not interact for time\nintervals much larger than the age of the galaxy. The results indicate that the\ndifferent sticky regions do not lead to a unified chaotic sea. Thus, the\nbehavior of the 3D sticky orbits differs from that observed in the 2D system.\nFurthermore, the 3D motion near the center of a triaxial elliptical galaxy\nseems to be very complicated, displaying several families of resonant orbits,\ndifferent chaotic components and sticky regions, while only a small fraction of\norbits is regular.

The concept aims to optimize the operation scheme for graphene\ntransistors toward a superior on-off property. The device has two bulk graphene\nregions where the carrier type is electrostatically controlled by a top gate,\nand these two regions are separated by a nanoribbon which works as an\ninsulator. As a result, the device forms a (P or N)-I-(P or N) junction\nstructure. The off state is obtained by lifting the band of the bulk graphene\nof the source (drain) side and lowering that of the drain (source) side, so\nthat the device forms a P-I-N (N-I-P) junction. In this configuration, the\nleakage current can be reduced more effectively than the conventional single\ngate transistors with the same band gap size due to a high barrier height and a\nlong tunneling length in the nanoribbon. The on state is obtained by flipping\nthe polarity of the bias of either top gate to form a P-I-P or N-I-N junction.\nAn experiment showed that the drain current was suppressed in the cases of\nP-I-N and N-I-P compared to the cases of P-I-P and N-I-N, and all of the\nbehaviors were consistent with what was expected from the device operation\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2011 08:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-15"}

For each of these three cases\ngood data are available from literature, which allows us to estimate the\nprobability that resistance evolves from standing genetic variation. Depending\non the treatment we find probabilities of the evolution of drug resistance due\nto standing genetic variation between 0 and 39%.

In the\nlast two decades many groups have been working on the dynamics of the magnetic\nmoment in nanomagnetic materials at low temperatures, it giving rise to the\nobservation of quantum relaxations and quantum hysteresis cycles. For the first\ntime, we report experimental evidence of quantum dynamics of the vortex core of\nmicron-size permalloy (Fe$_{19}$Ni$_{81}$) disks induced by the application of\nan in-plane magnetic field. It is attributed to the quantum tunneling of the\nvortex core through pinning barriers, which are associated to structural\ndefects in the dots, towards its equilibrium position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2011 15:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The detection of extended conserved synteny regions was based on\ncontinuous fuzzy similarity rather than on chains of discrete anchors (genes or\nhighly conserved noncoding elements). In addition to the high correspondence\nfound in the comparisons of whole-genome sequences, a good similarity was also\nfound after masking gene sequences, indicating that CS analysis manages to\nreveal phylogenetic signal in the organization of noncoding part of the genome\nsequences, including repetitive DNA and the genome \"dark matter\". Obviously,\nthe possibility to reveal parallel ordering depends on the signal of common\nancestor sequence organization varying locally along the corresponding segments\nof the compared genomes. We explored two sources contributing to this signal:\nsequence composition (GC content) and sequence organization (abundances of\nk-mers in the usual A,T,G,C or purine-pyrimidine alphabets). Whole-genome\ncomparisons based on GC distribution along the analyzed sequences indeed gives\nreasonable results, but combining it with k-mer abundances dramatically\nimproves the ordering quality, indicating that compositional and organizational\nheterogeneity comprise complementary sources of information on evolutionary\nconserved similarity of genome sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2011 15:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-02"}
