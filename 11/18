We take into\naccount the presence of the depletant by introducing an effective depletion\nattraction between a pair of boardlike particles. At fixed depletant fugacity,\nthe stable liquid crystal phase is determined through a mean-field theory with\nrestricted orientations. Interestingly, we predict that for slightly elongated\nboardlike particles a critical depletant density exists, where the system\nundergoes a direct transition from an isotropic liquid to a biaxial nematic\nphase. As a consequence, by tuning the depletant density, an easy experimental\ncontrol parameter, one can stabilize states of high biaxial nematic order even\nwhen these states are unstable for pure systems of boardlike particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 16:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 08:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

High harmonics are generated in form of\n(sub-)attosecond pulses when the plasma surface rebounds towards the observer\nwith relativistic velocity. Different cases are considered. The\n\"relativistically oscillating mirror\" (ROM) model, describing the most typical\ncase, is analyzed in detail. The resulting harmonic spectrum is usually a power\nlaw with the exponent -8/3 [baeva2006relativistic], but possible exceptions due\nto \"higher order \\gamma-spikes\" are considered. It is shown that under certain\nconditions, ultra-dense electron nanobunches can be formed at plasma surface\nthat emit coherent synchrotron radiation. The resulting spectrum is much\nflatter and leads to the formation of a giant attosecond pulse in the reflected\nradiation. The harmonics radiation is also considered in time domain, where\nthey form a train of attosecond pulses. It is characterized and a possibility\nto select a single attosecond pulse via polarization gating is described.\nFurther, the line structure in relativistic harmonic spectra is analyzed. It is\nshown that the harmonics have an intrinsic chirp and it can be responsible for\nexperimentally observed spectral modulations. Finally, high harmonic generation\nis considered in realistic three-dimensional geometry. It is shown that free\nspace diffraction can act as a high pass filter, altering the spectrum and the\nreflected field structure. The high harmonics tend to be self-focused by the\nreflecting surface. This leads to a natural angular divergence as well as to\nfield boost at the focal position. Coherently focusing the harmonics using an\noptimized geometry may result in a significantly higher field than the field of\nthe driving laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 16:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-18"}

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are ubiquitous in the solar\natmosphere. In magnetic waveguides resonant absorption due to plasma\ninhomogeneity naturally transfers wave energy from large-scale motions to\nsmall-scale motions. In the cooler parts of the solar atmosphere as, e.g., the\nchromosphere, effects due to partial ionization may be relevant for wave\ndynamics and heating. Aims. We study resonant Alfven waves in partially ionized\nplasmas. Methods. We use the multifluid equations in the cold plasma\napproximation. We investigate propagating resonant MHD waves in partially\nionized flux tubes. We use approximate analytical theory based on normal modes\nin the thin tube and thin boundary approximations along with numerical\neigenvalue computations. Results. We find that the jumps of the wave\nperturbations across the resonant layer are the same as in fully ionized\nplasmas. The damping length due to resonant absorption is inversely\nproportional to the frequency, while that due to ion-neutral collisions is\ninversely proportional to the square of the frequency. For observed frequencies\nin the solar atmosphere, the amplitude of MHD kink waves is more efficiently\ndamped by resonant absorption than by ion-neutral collisions. Conclusions. Most\nof the energy carried by chromospheric kink waves is converted into localized\nazimuthal Alfven waves that can deposit energy in the coronal medium. The\ndissipation of wave energy in the chromosphere due to ion-neutral collisions is\nonly effective for high-frequency waves. The chromosphere acts as a filter for\nkink waves with periods shorter than 10 s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 16:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Unlike conventional magnons, the mode is\nnon-dispersive, and its intensity is sharply concentrated around a wave vector\nseparate from those characterizing the antiferromagnetic order.

In\nparticular, the magnetospheric plasma leaves a strong imprint on the observed\nX-ray spectrum by means of Compton up-scattering of the thermal radiation\ncoming from the star surface. Motivated by the increased quality of the\nobservational data, much theoretical work has been devoted to develop Monte\nCarlo (MC) codes that incorporate the effects of resonant Compton scattering in\nthe modeling of radiative transfer of photons through the magnetosphere. The\ntwo key ingredients in this simulations are the kinetic plasma properties and\nthe magnetic field (MF) configuration. The MF geometry is expected to be\ncomplex, but up to now only mathematically simple solutions (self-similar\nsolutions) have been employed. In this work, we discuss the effects of new,\nmore realistic, MF geometries on synthetic spectra. We use new force-free\nsolutions in a previously developed MC code to assess the influence of MF\ngeometry on the emerging spectra.

We aim to\nstudy the formation of the grain mantles during the prestellar core phase and\nthe abundance of H2CO, CH3OH, and radicals trapped in them. We have developed a\nmacrosopic statistic multilayer model that follows the formation of grain\nmantles with time and that includes two effects that may increase the number of\nradicals trapped in the mantles: i) at each time of the mantle formation, only\nthe surface layer is chemically active rather than the entire bulk, and ii) the\nporous structure of grains allows to trap reactive particles.

We run a large grid of\nmodels to study the impact of the mantle multilayer nature and grain porous\nstructure.

We show that on the single-particle level attosecond streaking\ntime shifts contain spectral phase information associated with the\nEisenbud-Wigner-Smith (EWS) time delay, provided the influence of the streaking\ninfrared field is properly accounted for. While the streaking phase shifts for\nshort-ranged potentials agree with the associated EWS delays, Coulomb\npotentials require special care. We show that the interaction between the\noutgoing electron and the combined Coulomb and IR laser fields lead to a\nstreaking phase shift that can be described classically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 18:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

This intimate correspondence is optimized by a unified\ngaugino mass in the neighborhood of M_{1/2}=518 GeV. We supplement this\nanalysis by extrapolating for the expected data profile to be realized with\nfive inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity, as expected to be observed at\nthe LHC by the conclusion of 2011. Significantly, we find that this luminosity\nmay be sufficient to constitute a SUSY discovery for the favored benchmark\nspectrum. Indeed, the winds wafting our way from Geneva may already be heavy\nwith the delicate perfume of Supersymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 20:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Recently, Gluza, Kajda,\nand Kosower argued that the reduction to master integrals is complicated by the\npresence of integrals with doubled propagator denominators in the integration\nby parts relations and they introduced a novel reduction procedure which\neliminates all such integrals from the start. Their approach has the advantage\nthat it automatically produces integral bases which mesh well with generalized\nunitarity. The heart of their procedure is an algorithm which utilizes the\nweighty machinery of computational commutative algebra to produce complete sets\nof unitarity-compatible integration by parts relations. In this paper, we\npropose a conceptually simpler algorithm for the generation of complete sets of\nunitarity-compatible integration by parts relations based on recent results in\nthe mathematical literature. A striking feature of our algorithm is that it can\nbe described entirely in terms of straightforward linear algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 21:13:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 22:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 16:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We detect HI in ~40% of all ETGs outside the Virgo\ncluster and in ~10% of all ETGs inside it. This demonstrates that it is common\nfor non-cluster ETGs to host HI. The HI morphology varies from regular\ndiscs/rings (the majority of the detections) to unsettled gas distributions.\nThe former are either small discs (M(HI)<10^8 M_sun) confined within the\nstellar body and sharing the same kinematics of the stars, or large discs/rings\n(M(HI) up to 5x10^9 M_sun) extending to tens of kpc from the host galaxy and\nfrequently kinematically decoupled from the stars. Neutral hydrogen provides\nmaterial for star formation in ETGs. Galaxies with central HI exhibit\nsignatures of star formation in ~70% of the cases, ~5 times more frequently\nthan galaxies without central HI. The central ISM is dominated by molecular\ngas. In ETGs with a small gas disc the conversion of HI into H_2 is as\nefficient as in spirals. The ETG HI mass function has M*~2x10^9 M_sun and\nslope=-0.7. ETGs host much less HI than spirals as a family. However, a\nsignificant fraction of them is as HI-rich as spirals. The main difference\nbetween ETGs and spirals is that the former lack the high-column-density HI\ntypical of the bright stellar disc of the latter. We find an envelope of\ndecreasing M(HI) with increasing environment density. The gas-richest ETGs live\nin the poorest environments (where star-formation is more common), galaxies in\nthe centre of Virgo have the lowest HI content, and the cluster outskirts are a\ntransition region. We find an HI morphology-density relation. At low\nenvironment density HI is mostly distributed on large discs/rings. More\ndisturbed HI morphologies dominate environment densities typical of rich\ngroups, confirming the importance of processes occurring on a galaxy-group\nscale for the evolution of ETGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 23:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-26"}

We show that the\nminimum cut capacity of a relay network under some special assumptions can be\ncast as a minimization of a submodular function, and as a result, can be\ncomputed efficiently. We use this result to show that the capacity, or an\napproximation to the capacity within a constant gap for the Gaussian, wireless\nerasure, and Avestimehr-Diggavi-Tse deterministic relay network models can be\ncomputed in polynomial time. We present some empirical results showing that\ncomputing constant-gap approximations to the capacity of Gaussian relay\nnetworks with around 300 nodes can be done in order of minutes.\n  For Gaussian networks, cut-set capacities are also functions of the powers\nassigned to the nodes.

In particular, we show that\nthe minimization of the sum of powers assigned to the nodes subject to a\nminimum rate constraint (measured in terms of cut-set bounds) can be computed\nin polynomial time. We propose an heuristic algorithm to solve this problem and\nmeasure its performance through simulations on random Gaussian networks.

Our construction is based upon a solution\nknown in string theory as the linear dilaton, in which the back-reaction from a\nbulk scalar \\Phi is exactly accounted for. The radion, stabilized by \\Phi, is\nmuch heavier than the TeV scale and its couplings to the standard model are\nmuch more suppressed than in the usual Randall-Sundrum solution. We present a\nnew formalism for obtaining approximate time-dependent solutions, based on\nperturbing the exact solution to the coupled Einstein and scalar field\nequations in the bulk. It allows the radion potential to be computed directly\nin terms of the brane potentials for \\Phi. We show that simple exponential\npotentials on the branes can lead to a 4D radion potential with a flattened\nhilltop form, yielding inflation with a spectral index of typically n_s=0.96\nand no higher than 0.99. With more complicated brane potentials, the descent\nfrom the hilltop can be a linear potential, giving a tensor-to-scalar ratio as\nlarge as r=0.07 with n_s=0.974. The couplings of the radion to the standard\nmodel particles are dictated by general covariance, so the details of reheating\nare explicitly calculable, leading to a reheat temperature of at least 10^7\nGeV. The quantum corrections to the inflaton potential from its couplings to\nmatter are also calculable and are shown to be small, so that the prediction\nfor the shape of the potential is under theoretical control, even with\nsuperPlanckian field excursions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2011 02:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This is especially true\nin power-constrained environments, such as embedded and mobile computing. While\nlowering the operational voltage can reduce power consumption, there are limits\nimposed at design time, beyond which hardware components experience faulty\noperation. Moreover, the decrease in feature size has led to higher\nsusceptibility to process variations, leading to reliability issues and\nlowering yield. However, not all computations and all data in a workload need\nto maintain 100% fidelity. In this paper, we explore the idea of employing\nfunctional or storage units that let go the conservative guardbands imposed on\nthe design to guarantee reliable execution. Rather, these units exhibit Elastic\nFidelity, by judiciously lowering the voltage to trade-off reliable execution\nfor power consumption based on the error guarantees required by the executing\ncode. By estimating the accuracy required by each computational segment of a\nworkload, and steering each computation to different functional and storage\nunits, Elastic Fidelity Computing obtains power and energy savings while\nreaching the reliability targets required by each computational segment. Our\npreliminary results indicate that even with conservative estimates, Elastic\nFidelity can reduce the power and energy consumption of a processor by 11-13%\nwhen executing applications involving human perception that are typically\nincluded in modern mobile platforms, such as audio, image, and video decoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2011 04:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-22"}

Melt fluxes offer the possibility to grow bulk ZnO under mild\nconditions (<1000 deg. C, atmospheric pressure), but the crystals always\ncontain traces of solvent. The limited purity is a severe drawback, especially\nfor electronic applications. 3) From hydrothermal fluxes, usually alkaline\n(KOH, LiOH) aqueous solutions beyond the critical point.

Here we study the major effects of dust\nparticle structure, size-dependent grain settling, and instrumental properties.\nWe performed radiative transfer modeling using different dust particle models\nand disk structures. To study the influence of seeing and telescope diffraction\nwe ran the models through an instrument simulator for the ExPo dual-beam\nimaging polarimeter mounted at the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT).\nParticle shape and size have a strong influence on the brightness and\ndetectability of the disks. In the simulated observations, the central\nresolution element also contains contributions from the inner regions of the\nprotoplanetary disk besides the unpolarized central star. This causes the\ncentral resolution element to be polarized, making simple corrections for\ninstrumental polarization difficult. This effect strongly depends on the\nspatial resolution, so adaptive optics systems are needed for proper\npolarization calibration. We find that the commonly employed homogeneous sphere\nmodel gives results that differ significantly from more realistic models. For a\nproper analysis of the wealth of data available now or in the near future, one\nmust properly take the effects of particle types and disk structure into\naccount. The observed signal depends strongly on the properties of these more\nrealistic models, thus providing a potentially powerful diagnostic.

However, until now, in the dilute regime it has\nbeen difficult to obtain Curie temperatures larger than that measured in well\nannealed samples of (Ga,Mn)As ($\\sim$190 K for 12% doping). In the present\nwork, we propose an innovative path to room-temperature ferromagnetism in\ndiluted magnetic semiconductors. We theoretically show that even a very small\nconcentration of nanoscale inhomogeneities can lead to a tremendous boost of\nthe critical temperatures: up to a 1600% increase compared to the homogeneous\ncase.

The CME was associated with a M3.5 limb flare. High resolution\nobservations from SDO/AIA suggest the development of helical kink instability\nin the erupting prominence, which implies a flux rope structure of the magnetic\nfield. A brightening starts below the apex of the prominence with its slow\nrising motion (~100 km/s) during the activation phase. A bright structure,\nindicative of a helix with ~3-4 turns, was transiently formed at this position.\nThe corresponding twist of ~$6\\pi-8\\pi$ is sufficient to generate the helical\nkink instability in a flux rope according to recently developed models. A\nslowly rising blob structure was subsequently formed at the apex of the\nprominence, and a flaring loop was observed near the footpoints. Within two\nminutes, a second blob was formed in the northern prominence leg. The second\nblob erupts (like a plasmoid ejection) with the detachment of the northern\nprominence leg, and flare intensity maximizes. The first blob at the prominence\napex shows rotational motion in the counterclockwise direction in the plane of\nsky, interpreted as unwinding motion of a helix, and it also erupts to give the\ncoronal mass ejection (CME). RHESSI hard X-ray sources show the two footpoint\nsources and a loop-top source during the flare. We found RHESSI hard X-ray\nflux, soft X-ray flux derivative and CME acceleration in the low corona\ncorrelate well, which is in agreement with the standard flare model (CSHKP). We\nalso discuss the possible role of ballooning as well as torus instabilities in\ndriving the CME.

By extending this analysis to GaBiAs we\ndemonstrate that the observed strong variation of the band gap Eg and\nspin-orbit-splitting (SO) energy with Bi composition can be well explained in\nterms of a BAC interaction between the extended states of the GaAs valence band\nedge and highly localized Bi-related defect states lying in the valence band,\nwith the change in Eg also having a significant contribution from a\nconventional alloy reduction in the conduction band edge energy. Our calculated\nvalues of Eg and SO are in good agreement with experiment throughout the\ninvestigated composition range x less than 13%. In particular, our calculations\nreproduce the experimentally observed crossover to an Eg < SO regime at\napproximately 10.5% Bi composition in bulk GaBiAs. Recent x-ray spectroscopy\nmeasurements have indicated the presence of Bi pairs and clusters even for Bi\ncompositions as low as 2%. We include a systematic study of different Bi\nnearest-neighbor environments in the alloy to achieve a quantitative\nunderstanding of the effect of Bi pairing and clustering on the GaBiAs\nelectronic structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2011 15:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-12"}

The superconducting ground state of the vacuum is\nassociated with a spontaneous emergence of quark-antiquark condensates which\ncarry quantum numbers of charged rho mesons. The rho-meson condensate is an\ninhomogeneous structure made of the so-called rho vortices, which are parallel\nto the magnetic field axis. The condensation of the charged rho mesons induces\na (much weaker) superfluid-like condensate with quantum numbers of the neutral\nrho mesons. In this paper we show that the vortices in the superconducting\ncondensate organize themselves in an equilateral triangular lattice similarly\nto an ordinary type-II superconductor. We show that each of these\nsuperconductor vortices is accompanied by three superfluid vortices and three\nsuperfluid antivortices made of the neutral rho meson condensate.
