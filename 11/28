Our motivation is provided by the additivity\nquestions in quantum information theory, and we build on the idea that a Bell\nstate sent through a product of conjugated random channels has at least one\nlarge eigenvalue. We generalize this setting in two directions. First, we\ninvestigate general entangled pure inputs and show that that Bell states give\nthe least entropy among those inputs in the asymptotic limit. We then study\nmixed input states, and obtain new multi-scale random matrix models that allow\nto quantify the difference of the outputs' eigenvalues between a quantum\nchannel and its complementary version in the case of a non-pure input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2011 16:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

The PDW phase\nis characterized by a finite spin gap and a superconducting order parameter\nwith a finite (commensurate in this case) wave vector and power-law\nsuperconducting correlations.

While in tomography the focus of the reconstruction method is\nto recover the velocity structure of the domain, the shape and trajectory\nreconstruction procedure directly finds the shape and trajectory of the\nobstacle. The physical signal carrier for this innovative method are ultrasonic\nbeams. When the speed of sound is constant, the rays are straight line segments\nand the shape and trajectory of moving objects will be reconstructed with\nmethods based on the travel time equation and ellipsoid geometry. For variable\nspeed of sound, we start with the eikonal equation and a system of differential\nequations that has its origins in acoustics and seismology. In this case, the\nrays are curves that are not necessarily straight line segments and we develop\nalgorithms for shape and trajectory tracking based on the numerical solution of\nthese equations.

This optimizes the energy spent by transmitters for tracking the\nobject, reduces signal attenuation and improves image resolution. It is a safe\nand secure method.

For non-interacting fermion systems\nwith time reversal (T), charge conjugation (C), and/or U(1) (N) symmetries, the\ntotal symmetry group can depend on the relations between those symmetry\noperations, such as T N T^{-1}= N or T N T^{-1}= -N.

In this paper, we use Kitaev's K-theory approach to classify\nthe gapped free fermion phases for those possible symmetry groups. In\nparticular, we can view the U(1) as a spin rotation.

A minimal model of this type has one left-handed fermion.\nNonminimal extensions contain, in addition, $N_f$ right-handed fermions. Our\ntask is to derive expressions for the $\\beta$ functions valid to all orders. To\nthis end we use a variety of methods: (i) perturbative analysis; (ii) instanton\ncalculus; (iii) analysis of the supercurrent supermultiplet (the so-called\nhypercurrent) and its anomalies, and some other arguments. All these arguments,\ncombined, indicate a direct parallel between the heterotic $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$\nCP(1) models and four-dimensional super-Yang-Mills theories. In particular, the\nminimal $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ CP(1) model is similar to ${\\mathcal N}=1$\nsupersymmetric gluodynamics. Its exact $\\beta$ function can be found; it has\nthe structure of the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (NSVZ) $\\beta$\nfunction of supersymmetric gluodynamics. The passage to nonminimal\n$\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ sigma models is equivalent to adding matter. In this case\nan NSVZ-type exact relation between the $\\beta$ function and the anomalous\ndimensions $\\gamma$ of the \"matter\" fields is established. We derive an analog\nof the Konishi anomaly.

However,\nfabrication of molecular spintronics devices is extremely challenging and\ninhibits the insightful experimental studies. Recently, we produced Multilayer\nEdge Molecular Spintronics Devices (MEMSDs) by bridging the organometallic\nmolecular clusters (OMCs) across a ~2 nm thick insulator of a magnetic tunnel\njunction (MTJ), along its exposed side edges. These MEMSDs exhibited\nunprecedented increase in exchange coupling between ferromagnetic films and\ndramatic changes in the spin transport. This paper focuses on the dramatic\ncurrent suppression phenomenon exhibited by MEMSDs at room temperature. In the\nevent of current suppression, the effective MEMESDs' current reduced by as much\nas six orders in magnitude as compared to the leakage current level of a MTJ\ntest bed. In the suppressed current state, MEMSD's transport could be affected\nby the temperature, light radiation, and magnetic field. In the suppressed\ncurrent state MEMSD also showed photovoltaic effect. This study motivates the\ninvestigation of MEMSDs involving other combinations of MTJs and promising\nmagnetic molecules like single molecular magnets and porphyrin. Observation of\ncurrent suppression on similar systems will unequivocally establish the utility\nof MEMSD approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 06:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

The apparent shape\nand size of the ionized bubble, as seen by a distant observer, depends on the\nparameters \\dot{N}_{phs}/C, x_HI/C and \\tau_Q where \\dot{N}_{phs}, \\tau_Q, x_HI\nand C are respectively the photon emission rate, age of the quasar, the neutral\nfraction and clumping factor of the IGM.Here we have analytically estimated the\nshape and size of a quasar's ionized bubble assuming an uniform IGM and\nignoring other ionizing sources besides the quasar, and used this as a template\nfor matched filter bubble search with the GMRT visibility data. We have assumed\nthat \\dot{N}_{phs} is known from the infrared spectrum and C from theoretical\nconsiderations, which gives us two free parameters x_HI and \\tau_Q for bubble.\nConsidering 1,000 hr of observation, we find that there is a reasonably large\nregion of parameter space where a 3\\sigma detection is possible.

The presence of other\nsources increase the size of the quasar bubble, leading to underestimation of\nx_HI.

The mechanism and timescale of reionization remain largely\nunknown. Measurements of the CMB Doppler effect from ionizing bubbles embedded\nin large-scale velocity streams (the patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect)\ncan constrain the duration of reionization. When combined with large-scale CMB\npolarization measurements, the evolution of the ionized fraction can be\ninferred. Using new multi-frequency data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT),\nwe show that the ionized fraction evolved relatively rapidly. For our basic\nforeground model, we find the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power sourced by\nreionization at l=3000 to be <= 2.1 micro K^2 at 95% CL. Using reionization\nsimulations, we translate this to a limit on the duration of reionization of\nDelta z <= 4.4 (95% CL). We find that this constraint depends on assumptions\nabout the angular correlation between the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power and\nthe cosmic infrared background (CIB). Introducing the degree of correlation as\na free parameter, we find that the limits on kSZ power weaken to <= 4.9 micro\nK^2, implying Delta z <= 7.9 (95% CL). We combine the SPT constraint on the\nduration of reionization with the WMAP7 measurement of the integrated optical\ndepth to probe the cosmic ionization history.

Paper I concluded that, for the\nrelatively strong magnetic coupling expected in real systems, additional\nprocesses are necessary to explain the existence of slowly rotating\npre-main-sequence stars. In the present paper, we extend the stellar spin model\nto include the effect of a spin-down torque that arises from an\naccretion-powered stellar wind. For a range of magnetic field strengths,\naccretion rates, initial spin rates, and mass outflow rates, the modeled stars\nexhibit rotation periods within the range of 1--10 days in the age range of\n1--3 Myr. This range coincides with the bulk of the observed rotation periods,\nwith the slow rotators corresponding to stars with the lowest accretion rates,\nstrongest magnetic fields, and/or highest stellar wind mass outflow rates.

Using elements from the theory of Hardy spaces one gets a\nsomewhat surprising condition for a sequence of complex numbers to be the\nFourier coefficients of an N-invariant measure.

The main emphasis\nwere to study whether the S0s are former spirals in which star formation has\nbeen ceased, and also, how robust are bars in galaxies. Based on our analysis\nthe Hubble sequence was revisited: following the early idea by van den Bergh we\nsuggested that the S0s are spread throughout the Hubble sequence in parallel\ntuning forks as spirals (S0a, S0b, S0c etc.). This is evidenced by our improved\nbulge-to-total (B/T) flux ratios, reaching as small values as typically found\nin late-type spirals. The properties of bulges and disks in S0s were found to\nbe similar to those in spirals. Also, the masses and scale parameters of the\nbulges and disks were found to be coupled.

Although these parameters have been tuned via linear analysis, the\nsensitivity analysis of these parameters and other related parameters are still\nnot sufficient for detecting the behaviors of the dispersion and dissipation\nrelations of the MRT-LBM. Previous researches have shown that the bulk\ndissipation in the MRT-LBM induces a significant over-damping of acoustic\ndisturbances. This indicates that MRT-LBM cannot be used to obtain the correct\nbehavior of pressure fluctuations because of the fixed bulk relaxation\nparameter. In order to cure this problem, an effective algorithm has been\nproposed for recovering the linearized Navier-Stokes equations from the\nlinearized MRT-LBM.

We make use of a chemical network which includes gas phase reactions\nas well as processes on the grains; desorption from the grain surface through\nchemical reaction is also included.

This compound is\nconsidered to order ferromagnetically (below 16 K), unlike other members of\nthis series which order antiferromagnetically. In addition, magnetic ordering\ntemperature (To) is significantly enhanced with respect to de Gennes scaled\nvalue. In order to understand the magnetism of this compound better, we have\ninvestigated the magnetic behavior in detail (under external pressure as well)\nand also of its solid solutions based on substitutions at Nd and at Si sites,\nviz., on the series, Nd(2-x)(Y,La)(x)PdSi(3-y)Ge(y) (x, y= 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and\n1.2) by bulk measurements. The results overall establish that Nd2PdSi3 orders\nferromagnetically below 16 K, but antiferromagnetic component seems to set in\nat very low temperatures. Notably, there is a significant suppression of To for\nY and Ge substitutions, compared to La substitution, for a given magnitude of\nunit-cell volume change, however qualitatively correlating with the separation\nbetween the layers of Nd and Pd-Si(Ge). On the basis of this observation, we\nconclude that 4f(Nd) hybridization plays a major role on the magnetism of the\nformer solid solutions. To our knowledge, this work serves as a rare\ndemonstration of 4f-hybridization effects on the magnetism of a Nd-based\nintermetallic compound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 15:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In\nparticular, they prove that for the pattern of zeros in $A$ to be retained in\nthe Cholesky decomposition of $A$, the pattern of zeros in $A$ has to\nnecessarily correspond to a chordal (or decomposable) graph associated with a\nspecific type of vertex ordering. This result therefore yields a\ncharacterization of chordal graphs in terms of sparse positive definite\nmatrices. It has also proved to be extremely useful in probabilistic and\nstatistical analysis of Markov random fields where zeros in positive definite\ncorrelation matrices are intimately related to the notion of stochastic\nindependence. Now, consider a positive definite matrix $A$ and its Cholesky\ndecomposition given by $A = LDL^T$, where $L$ is lower triangular with unit\ndiagonal entries, and $D$ a diagonal matrix with positive entries. In this\npaper, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for zeros (i.e.,\nsparsity) in a positive definite matrix $A$ to be preserved in its associated\nCholesky matrix $L$, \\, and in addition also preserved in the inverse of the\nCholesky matrix $L^{-1}$, is that the pattern of zeros corresponds to a\nco-chordal or homogeneous graph associated with a specific type of vertex\nordering.
