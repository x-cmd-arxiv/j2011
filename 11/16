The importance of thermal conduction on\nhot accretion flow is confirmed by observations of the hot gas that surrounds\nSgr A$^*$ and a few other nearby galactic nuclei. In this research, the effect\nof thermal conduction is studied by a saturated form of it, as is appropriate\nfor weakly collisional systems. The angular momentum transport is assumed to be\na result of viscous turbulence and the $\\alpha$-prescription is used for the\nkinematic coefficient of viscosity. The equations of accretion flow are solved\nin a simplified one-dimensional model that neglects the latitudinal dependence\nof the flow. To solve the integrated equations that govern the dynamical\nbehaviour of the accretion flow, we have used an unsteady self-similar\nsolution. The solution provides some insights into the dynamics of\nquasi-spherical accretion flow and avoids from limits of the steady\nself-similar solution. In comparison to accretion flows without thermal\nconduction, the disc generally becomes cooler and denser. These properties are\nqualitatively consistent with performed simulations in hot accretion flows.\nMoreover, the angular velocity increases with the magnitude of conduction,\nwhile the radial infall velocity decreases. The mass accretion rate onto the\ncentral object is reduced in the presence of thermal conduction. We found that\nthe viscosity and thermal conduction have the opposite effects on the physical\nvariables. Furthermore, the flow represents a transonic point that moves inward\nwith the magnitude of conduction or viscosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 16:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-11"}

The emission\nfirst decayed progressively through equilibrium states until the plasma reached\n2-3 MK. Then, a series of cooler lines, i.e. Ca x, Ca vii, Ne vi, O iv and Si\niii (formed in the temperature range log T = 4.3 - 6.3 under equilibrium\nconditions), are emitted at the same time and all evolve in a similar way. Here\nwe show that the simultaneous emission of lines with such a different formation\ntemperature is due to thermal instability occurring in the flaring plasma as\nsoon as it has cooled below ~ 2 MK. We can qualitatively reproduce the relative\nstart time of the light curves of each line in the correct order with a simple\n(and standard) model of a single flaring loop. The agreement with the observed\nlight curves is greatly improved, and a slower evolution of the line emission\nis predicted, if we assume that the model loop consists of an ensemble of\nsubloops or strands heated at slightly different times.

On short timescales the orbit of the small\nobject is approximately geodesic. Generic geodesics for a Kerr black hole\nspacetime have a complete set of integrals and can be characterized by three\nfrequencies of the motion. Over the course of an inspiral, a typical system\nwill pass through resonances where two of these frequencies become\ncommensurate. The effect of the resonance will be to alter significantly the\nrate of inspiral for the duration of the resonance. Understanding the impact of\nthese resonances on gravitational wave phasing is important to detect and\nexploit these signals for astrophysics and fundamental physics. Two\ndifferential equations that might describe the passage of an inspiral through\nsuch a resonance are investigated. These differ depending on whether it is the\nphase or the frequency components of a Fourier expansion of the motion that are\ntaken to be continuous through the resonance. Asymptotic and hyperasymptotic\nanalysis are used to find the late-time analytic behavior of the solution for a\nsystem that has passed through a resonance. Linearly growing (weak resonances)\nor linearly decaying (strong resonances) solutions are found depending on the\nstrength of the resonance. In the weak-resonance case, frequency resonances\nleave an imprint (a resonant memory) on the gravitational frequency evolution.\nThe transition between weak and strong resonances is characterized by a\nsquare-root singularity, and as one approaches this transition from above, the\nsolutions to the frequency resonance equation bunch up into families\nexponentially fast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 18:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This article investigates the reasons for\nbrain allometric distinction on a level of its microvessels. Based on collected\nempirical data it is found that regional cerebral blood flow CBF across gray\nmatter scales with cortical volume $V$ as $CBF \\sim V^{-1/6}$, brain capillary\ndiameter increases as $V^{1/12}$, and density of capillary length decreases as\n$V^{-1/6}$.

It is\nshown that the amount of capillary length and blood flow per cortical neuron\nare essentially conserved across mammals. These results indicate that geometry\nand dynamics of global neuro-vascular coupling have a proportionate character.\nMoreover, cerebral metabolic, hemodynamic, and microvascular variables scale\nwith allometric exponents that are simple multiples of 1/6, rather than 1/4,\nwhich suggests that brain metabolism is more similar to the metabolism of\naerobic than resting body.

In the leading shock,\nelectron density increases by a factor of about 3.5 in the simulation frame.\nStrong electromagnetic fields are generated in the trailing shock and provide\nan emission site. These magnetic fields contribute to the electron's transverse\ndeflection behind the shock. Our initial results of a jet-ambient interaction\nwith anti-parallel magnetic fields show pile-up of magnetic fields at the\ncolliding shock, which may lead to reconnection and associated particle\nacceleration. We will investigate the radiation in transient stage as a\npossible generation mechanism of precursors of prompt emission. In our\nsimulations we calculate the radiation from electrons in the shock region. The\ndetailed properties of this radiation are important for understanding the\ncomplex time evolution and spectral structure in gamma-ray bursts, relativistic\njets, and supernova remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 19:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

With its ~100km size, Lutetia is one\nof the largest asteroids ever imaged by a spacecraft. During the flyby, the\non-board OSIRIS imaging system acquired spectacular images of Lutetia's\nnorthern hemisphere revealing a complex surface scarred by numerous impact\ncraters, reaching the maximum dimension of about 55km. In this paper, we assess\nthe cratering history of the asteroid. For this purpose, we apply current\nmodels describing the formation and evolution of main belt asteroids, that\nprovide the rate and velocity distributions of impactors. These models, coupled\nwith appropriate crater scaling laws, allow us to interpret the observed crater\nsize-frequency distribution (SFD) and constrain the cratering history. Thanks\nto this approach, we derive the crater retention age of several regions on\nLutetia, namely the time lapsed since their formation or global surface reset.\nWe also investigate the influence of various factors -like Lutetia's bulk\nstructure and crater obliteration- on the observed crater SFDs and the\nestimated surface ages. From our analysis, it emerges that Lutetia underwent a\ncomplex collisional evolution, involving major local resurfacing events till\nrecent times. The difference in crater density between the youngest and oldest\nrecognized units implies a difference in age of more than a factor of 10. The\nyoungest unit (Beatica) has an estimated age of tens to hundreds of Myr, while\nthe oldest one (Achaia) formed during a period when the bombardment of\nasteroids was more intense than the current one, presumably around 3.6Gyr ago\nor older.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 20:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To get insight into the various\nprocesses of galaxy mass assembly, the Mass Assembly Survey with SINFONI in\nVVDS (MASSIV) aims at probing the kinematical and chemical properties of a\nsignificant and representative sample of high-redshift (0.9 < z < 1.8)\nstar-forming galaxies. This paper presents the selection function, the\nobserving strategy and the global properties of the MASSIV sample. This sample\ncontains 84 star-forming galaxies, selected from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey\n(VVDS) and observed with the SINFONI IFU at the VLT. We present the redshift\ndistribution, and derive the stellar masses and SED-based star formation rates\n(SFR). Integrated metallicities and the presence of type-2 AGNs are\ninvestigated using composite 1D spectra built from VIMOS and SINFONI\nobservations. The MASSIV selection function, based on star formation criteria\n([OII] emission-line strength up to z~1.5 and colors/UV absorption lines at\nhigher redshifts), provides a good representation of \"normal\" star-forming\ngalaxies with SED-based SFRs between 5 and 400 Msun/yr in the stellar mass\nregime 10^9 - 10^11 Msun. Analysis of typical emission-line ratios performed on\ncomposite spectra reveals that the contamination by type-2 AGNs is very low and\nthat the integrated metallicity of the galaxies follows the well-known\nmass-metallicity relation. The MASSIV sample has been built upon a simple\nselection function, fully representative of the star-forming galaxy population\nat 0.9 < z < 1.8 for SFR > 5 Msun/yr. Together with the size of the sample, the\nspatially-resolved SINFONI data therefore enables us to discuss global, volume\naveraged, galaxy kinematic and chemical properties all accross the mass and SFR\nrange of the survey to derive robust conclusions on galaxy mass assembly over\ncosmological timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 20:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We\nhave characterise the emission of the far-infrared fine-structure lines of\n[CII] (158um), [OI] (63 and 145um), and [NII] (122um) that trace the gas local\nconditions. The observed distribution and variation of the lines are discussed\nin relation to the underlying geometry and linked to the energetics associated\nwith the Trapezium stars. These observations enable us to map the spatial\ndistribution of these fine-structure lines with a spatial resolution between 4\"\nand 11\" and covering a total square area of about 120\"x105\". The spatial\nprofile of the emission lines are modelled using the radiative transfer code\nCloudy. We find that the spatial distribution of the [CII] line coincides with\nthat of the [OI] lines. The [NII] line peaks closer to the ionising star than\nthe other three lines, but with a small region of overlap. We can distinguish\nseveral knots of enhanced emission within the Bar indicating the presence of an\ninhomogenous and structured medium. The emission profiles cannot be reproduced\nby a single photo-dissociation region, clearly indicating that, besides the\nBar, there is a significant contribution from additional photo-dissociation\nregion(s) over the area studied. The combination of both the [NII] and [OI]\n145um lines can be used to estimate the [CII] emission and distinguish between\nits ionised or neutral origin. We have calculated how much [CII] emission comes\nfrom the neutral and ionised region, and find that at least 82% originates from\nthe photo-dissocciation region. Together, the [CII] 158um and [OI] 63 and 145um\nlines account for 90% of the power emitted by the main cooling lines in the Bar\n(including CO, H2, etc...), with [OI] 63um alone accounting for 72% of the\ntotal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 21:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To date, all successful\nrealizations of instability models have concentrated on evolving the four giant\nplanets onto their current orbits from a more compact configuration.\nSimultaneously, the possibility of forming and ejecting additional planets has\nbeen discussed, but never successfully implemented. Here we show that a large\narray of 5-planet (2 gas giants + 3 ice giants) multi-resonant initial states\ncan lead to an adequate formation of the outer solar system, featuring an\nejection of an ice giant during a phase of instability. Particularly, our\nsimulations demonstrate that the eigenmodes which characterize the outer solar\nsystem's secular dynamics can be closely matched with a 5-planet model.\nFurthermore, provided that the ejection timescale of the extra planet is short,\norbital excitation of a primordial cold classical Kuiper belt can also be\navoided in this scenario. Thus the solar system is one of many possible\noutcomes of dynamical relaxation and can originate from a wide variety of\ninitial states. This deems the construction of a unique model of solar system's\nearly dynamical evolution impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 22:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Traditional de-duplication tasks, while challenging, typically\ninvolved a fixed schema such as Census data or medical records. However, with\nthe presence of large, diverse sets of structured data on the web and the need\nto organize it effectively on content portals, de-duplication systems need to\nscale in a new dimension to handle a large number of schemas, tasks and data\nsets, while handling ever larger problem sizes.

However, this\ndynamical limit is in tension with meteoritic evidence that the Solar System\nwas exposed to a nearby supernova during or shortly after its formation; a\n1000-star cluster is much too small for supernova contamination to be likely.\nIn this paper we revisit the dynamical limit in the light of improved\nobservations of the properties of young clusters. We use a series of scattering\nsimulations to measure the velocity-dependent cross-section for disruption of\nthe outer Solar System by stellar encounters, and use this cross-section to\ncompute the probability of a disruptive encounter as a function of birth\ncluster properties. We find that, contrary to prior work, the probability of\ndisruption is small regardless of the cluster mass, and that it actually\ndecreases rather than increases with cluster mass. Our results differ from\nprior work for three main reasons: (1) unlike in most previous work, we compute\na velocity-dependent cross section and properly integrate over the cluster\nmass-dependent velocity distribution of incoming stars; (2) we adopt\nrealistically-short cluster lifetimes of a few crossing times, rather than\nassuming lifetimes of 10 to 100 Myr; and (3) following recent observations, we\nadopt a mass-independent surface density for embedded clusters, rather than a\nmass-independent radius as assumed many earlier papers. Our results remove the\ntension between the dynamical limit and the meteoritic evidence, and suggest\nthat the Sun was born in a massive cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 00:06:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 16:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We review this work, and analyze\npossible reasons for the discrepancies. We explain that the smallest values for\nthe spin Hall angle that have been reported, based on measurements of lateral\npermalloy/copper/platinum devices, are incorrect because the original analyses\ndid not properly take into account that copper layers in these devices will\nshunt charge current flowing through adjacent platinum wires, thereby greatly\nreducing the size of the spin-Hall-related signals.

We present a new measurement of the spin\ndiffusion length in Pt within sputtered Pt/permalloy bilayer thin films at room\ntemperature, finding 1.4 \\pm 0.3 nm, a much smaller value than has generally\nbeen assumed previously. With this value for the spin diffusion length, the\npreviously-discordant results can be brought into much better agreement, with\nthe result that the spin Hall conductivities are (1.4 - 3.4) x 10^5 [hbar/(2e)]\n(Ohm-m)^-1 and the spin Hall angles are greater than 0.05.

Over the range of conditions investigated (gaps\nbetween 9 and 14 {\\AA} and surface areas between 1 and 9 nm^2) the free energy\nbarrier to evaporation scales linearly with the gap between hydrophobic\nsurfaces, suggesting that line tension makes the predominant contribution to\nthe free energy barrier.

The noise analysis shows that detector dark counts, leaked pump\nlight, linear and nonlinear losses, multiple pair generation and detector\njitter are the limiting factors to the CAR performance of the sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 03:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-16"}

Then\nthe ultimate meaning is: understanding visible mass - size correlation and/or\nFundamental Plane means understanding how galaxies form. The mass - size\nrelationship involves baryon (mainly stellar) mass and its typical dimension\nrelated to the light, but it gets memory of the cosmological mass variance at\nthe equivalence epoch. The reason is that the baryonic component virializes by\nsharing virial energy in about equal amount between baryons and dark matter,\nthis sharing depending, in turn, on the steepness of the dark matter\ndistribution. The general strategy consists in using the two-component tensor\nvirial theorem for determining the virialized baryonic configurations.

The existence of a large number of potential escapers, which have\nenergies above the escape energy but are still within the tidal radius, is\ntaken into account in the models. The models allow potential escapers to\nexperience gravitational scatterings before they leave clusters and thus some\nof them may lose enough energy to be bound again. It is shown that the mass\nevolution of the Fokker-Planck models are in good agreement with that of N-body\nmodels including the full tidal-force field. The mass-loss time does not simply\nscale with the relaxation time due to the existence of potential escapers; it\nincreases with the number of stars more slowly than the relaxation time, though\nit tends to be proportional to the relaxation time in the limit of a weak tidal\nfield. The Fokker-Planck models include two parameters, the coefficient gamma\nin the Coulomb logarithm ln(gamma N) and the coefficient nu_e controlling the\nefficiency of the mass loss. The values of these parameters are determined by\ncomparing the Fokker-Planck models with the N-body models. It is found that the\nparameter set (gamma, nu_e)=(0.11, 7) works well for both single-mass and\nmulti-mass clusters, but that the parameter set (gamma, nu_e)=(0.02, 40) is\nanother possible choice for multi-mass clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 12:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2011 06:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

But much can already be\ndeduced without constructing the entire rotation profile. The mathematics may\nbe combined with dynamical arguments put forth in previous works to the mutual\nbenefit of each. An important element of our approach is to regard the constant\nangular velocity surfaces as an independent coordinate variable for what is\ntermed the \"residual entropy,\" a quantity that plays a key role in the equation\nof thermal wind balance. The difference between the dynamics of the bulk of the\nSCZ and the tachocline is due to a different functional form of the residual\nentropy in each region. We develop a unified theory for the rotational behavior\nof both the SCZ and the tachocline, using the solutions for the characteristics\nof the thermal wind equation. These characteristics are identical to the\nisorotation contours in the bulk of the SCZ, but the two deviate in the\ntachocline. The outer layer may be treated, at least descriptively, by similar\nmathematical techniques, but this region probably does not obey thermal wind\nbalance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 14:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The\nHCN(1-0)/CO(2-1) flux ratio differs by more than an order of magnitude between\nthese two regions. We carry out large velocity gradient (LVG) computations to\ndetermine the range of parameters (gas temperature and density, HCN/CO\nabundance ratio, column densities and velocity gradients) that yield physically\nplausible solutions for the observed flux ratio in the central 100pc. The\nobserved HCN/CO intensity ratio in the nucleus is consistent with very\noptically thick thermalized emission in very dense (>=10^5cm^{-3}) gas, in\nwhich case the HCN/CO abundance ratio there is unconstrained. Alternatively,\nthe HCN/CO intensity ratio could be due to optically thinner emissions but with\nvery high (~10^{-2}) HCN/CO abundance ratios. This possibility is more\nconsistent with the CO and HCN emissions seen in the nuclei of the Seyfert\ngalaxies NGC1068 and NGC6951.

A famous 1935 Erdos--Szekeres theorem\nasserts that every such P contains a monotone subsequence S of $\\sqrt N$\npoints. Another, equally famous theorem from the same paper implies that every\nsuch P contains a convex or concave subsequence of $\\Omega(\\log N)$ points.\n  Monotonicity is a property determined by pairs of points, and convexity\nconcerns triples of points. We propose a generalization making both of these\ntheorems members of an infinite family of Ramsey-type results. First we define\na (k+1)-tuple $K\\subseteq P$ to be positive if it lies on the graph of a\nfunction whose kth derivative is everywhere nonnegative, and similarly for a\nnegative (k+1)-tuple. Then we say that $S\\subseteq P$ is kth-order monotone if\nits (k+1)-tuples are all positive or all negative.\n  We investigate quantitative bound for the corresponding Ramsey-type result\n(i.e., how large kth-order monotone subsequence can be guaranteed in every\nN-point P). We obtain an $\\Omega(\\log^{(k-1)}N)$ lower bound ((k-1)-times\niterated logarithm). This is based on a quantitative Ramsey-type theorem for\nwhat we call transitive colorings of the complete (k+1)-uniform hypergraph; it\nalso provides a unified view of the two classical Erdos--Szekeres results\nmentioned above.\n  For k=3, we construct a geometric example providing an $O(\\log\\log N)$ upper\nbound, tight up to a multiplicative constant. As a consequence, we obtain\nsimilar upper bounds for a Ramsey-type theorem for order-type homogeneous\nsubsets in R^3, as well as for a Ramsey-type theorem for hyperplanes in R^4\nrecently used by Dujmovic and Langerman.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 14:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2011 09:58:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 15:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-23"}

The great novelty of such mechanism is that\nthe gravitational field acts merely as a catalyst, once the final expression of\nthe mass does not depend either on the intensity or on the particular\ncharacteristics of the gravitational field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 13:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-21"}

Moreover, there is also confusion\nregarding the nature of life. In this situation, it seems the task of\ndetermining the fundamental complexity measures of life is especially\ndifficult. Yet this task is just part of a greater task: obtaining substantial\ninsights into the nature of biological evolution. We think that without a firm\nquantitative basis characterizing the most fundamental aspects of life, it is\nimpossible to overcome the confusion so as to clarify the nature of biological\nevolution. The approach we present here offers such quantitative measures of\ncomplexity characterizing biological organization and, as we will see,\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 09:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}
