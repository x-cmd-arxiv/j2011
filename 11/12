To consistently incorporate local time into tensor models, a\nrank- three tensor model with first class constraints in Hamilton formalism is\npresented. In the limit of usual continuous spaces, the algebra of constraints\nreproduces that of general relativity in Hamilton formalism. While the momentum\nconstraints can be realized rather easily by the symmetry of the tensor models,\nthe form of the Hamiltonian constraints is strongly limited by the condition of\nthe closure of the whole constraint algebra. Thus the Hamiltonian constraints\nhave been determined on the assumption that they are local and at most cubic in\ncanonical variables. The form of the Hamiltonian constraints has similarity\nwith the Hamiltonian in the c < 1 string field theory, but it seems impossible\nto realize such a constraint algebras in the framework of vector or matrix\nmodels. Instead these models are rather useful as matter theories coupled with\nthe tensor model.

If, however, the black\nhole spins rapidly and the poloidal magnetic field intensity on the black hole\nhorizon is comparable to the inner accretion disk pressure, a powerful jet may\nform whose luminosity can easily exceed the thermal UV luminosity. When the jet\nbeam points at Earth, its non-thermal luminosity can dominate the emitted\nspectrum. The thermal and non-thermal components decay differently with time.\nIn particular, the thermal emission should remain roughly constant for a\nsignificant time after the period of maximum accretion, beginning to diminish\nonly after a delay, whereas after the peak accretion rate, the non-thermal jet\nemission decays, but then reaches a plateau. Both transitions are tied to a\ncharacteristic timescale $t_{\\rm Edd}$ at which the accretion rate falls below\nEddington. Making use of this timescale in a new parameter-inference formalism\nfor tidal disruption events with significant emission from a jet, we analyze\nthe recent flare source Swift J2058. It is consistent with an event in which a\nmain sequence solar-type staris disrupted by a black hole of mass $\\sim 4\n\\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$. The beginning of the flat phase in the non-thermal\nemission from this source can possibly be seen in the late-time lightcurve.\nOptical photometry over the first $\\simeq 40$ d of this flare is also\nconsistent with this picture, but is only weakly constraining because the\nbolometric correction is very uncertain. We suggest that future searches for\nmain sequence tidal disruptions use methods sensitive to jet radiation as well\nas to thermal UV radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 17:11:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 04:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In the combined\nmodel, one-dimensional fluid equations are applied for the dense part of the\natmosphere, while the exobase region is described by a kinetic model and\ncalculated by the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Fluid and kinetic parts\nof the model are iteratively solved in order to maintain constant total mass\nand energy fluxes through the simulation region. Although the atmosphere was\nfound to be highly extended, with an exobase altitude at ~6000 km at solar\nminimum, the outflow remained subsonic and the escape rate was within a factor\nof two of the Jeans rate for the exobase temperatures determined. This picture\nis drastically different from recent predictions obtained solely using a fluid\nmodel which, in itself, requires assumptions about atmospheric density, flow\nvelocity and energy flux carried away by escaping molecules at infinity.

We\nshow, by constructing one to one maps to the particle partition entanglement\nspectra, that the counting of the real-space entanglement spectra levels for\ndifferent particle number sectors versus their angular momentum along the\nspatial partition boundary is equal to the counting of states for the system\nwith a number of (unpinned) bulk quasiholes excitations corresponding to the\nsame particle and flux numbers. This proves that, for an ideal model state\ndescribed by a conformal field theory, the real-space entanglement spectra\nlevel counting is bounded by the counting of the conformal field theory edge\nmodes. This bound is known to be saturated in the thermodynamic limit (and at\nfinite sizes for certain states). Numerically analyzing several ideal model\nstates, we find that the real-space entanglement spectra indeed display the\nedge modes dispersion relations expected from their corresponding conformal\nfield theories.

A\nfast, essentially acoustic, wave of a given frequency and wave number is\ngenerated below the surface and propagates upward though the Alfven/acoustic\nequipartition layer where it splits into upgoing slow (acoustic) and fast\n(magnetic) waves. The fast wave quickly reflects off the steep Alfven speed\ngradient, but around and above this reflection height it partially converts to\nAlfven waves, depending on the local relative inclinations of the background\nmagnetic field and the wavevector. To measure the efficiency of this conversion\nto Alfven waves we calculate acoustic and magnetic energy fluxes. The\nparticular amplitude and phase relations between the magnetic field and\nvelocity oscillations help us to demonstrate that the waves produced are indeed\nAlfven waves. We find that the conversion to Alfven waves is particularly\nimportant for strongly inclined fields like those existing in sunspot\npenumbrae. Equally important is the magnetic field orientation with respect to\nthe vertical plane of wave propagation, which we refer to as \"field azimuth\".\nFor field azimuth less than 90 degrees the generated Alfven waves continue\nupwards, but above 90 degrees downgoing Alfven waves are preferentially\nproduced. This yields negative Alfven energy flux for azimuths between 90 and\n180 degrees. Alfven energy fluxes may be comparable to or exceed acoustic\nfluxes, depending upon geometry, though computational exigencies limit their\nmagnitude in our simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 20:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Supersonic\nturbulence drives the density distribution to a lognormal with dispersion\nincreasing with Mach number; we generalize this to include scales >h (the disk\nscale height), and use it to construct the statistical properties of the\ndensity field smoothed on a scale R.

As such, an exact\n'bound object mass function' can be derived, from scales of the sonic length to\nabove the disk Jeans mass. This agrees remarkably well with observed GMC mass\nfunctions in the MW and other galaxies; the only inputs are the mass and size\nof the galaxies (to normalize the model). This explains the mass function\ncutoff and its power-law slope (close to, but shallower than, -2). The model\nalso predicts the linewidth-size and size-mass relations of clouds and the\ndependence of their residuals on surface density/pressure. We use this to\npredict the spatial correlation function/clustering of clouds and star\nclusters; these also agree well with observations. We predict the size/mass\nfunction of ISM 'bubbles' or 'holes', and show this can account for observed HI\nhole distributions without any local feedback.

Specifically, the\nterm equal to the usual exponential of $i$ times the Regge action corresponds\nto configurations either in sector (II+) with positive orientation or sector\n(II-) with negative orientation. The presence of the other terms beyond this\ncause problems in the semiclassical limit of the spin-foam model when\nconsidering multiple 4-simplices due to the fact that the different terms for\ndifferent 4-simplices mix in the semi-classical limit, leading in general to a\nnon-Regge action and hence non-Regge and non-gravitational configurations\npersisting in the semiclassical limit.\n  To correct this problem, we propose to modify the vertex so its asymptotics\ninclude only the one term of the form $e^{iS_{\\Regge}}$. To do this, an\nexplicit classical discrete condition is derived that isolates the desired\ngravitational sector corresponding to this one term. This condition is\nquantized and used to modify the vertex amplitude, yielding what we call the\n`proper EPRL vertex amplitude.'

To test this, we used the Chandra\nX-ray Observatory to observe 1RXS J072559.8-261229, a possible X-ray\ncounterpart to PSR J0726-2612, which, with its 3.44s period and 3e13G inferred\nmagnetic field strength, is the nearest and least extincted among the possible\nslowly-spinning, strong-field INS progenitors (it likely is in the Gould Belt,\nat ~1 kpc). We confirm the identification and find that the pulsar has a\nspectrum consistent with being purely thermal, with blackbody temperature\nkT=87+/-5 eV and radius R=5.7+2.6-1.3 km at a distance of 1 kpc.

In each round of a two-player bounded memory-m game, both players\nsimultaneously play an action, observe an outcome and receive a reward. The\nreward may depend on the last m outcomes as well as the actions of the players\nin the current round. The standard notion of regret for repeated games is no\nlonger suitable because actions and rewards can depend on the history of play.\nTo account for this generality, we introduce the notion of k-adaptive regret,\nwhich compares the reward obtained by playing actions prescribed by the\nalgorithm against a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary with the reward obtained\nby the best expert in hindsight against the same adversary. Roughly, a\nhypothetical k-adaptive adversary adapts her strategy to the defender's actions\nexactly as the real adversary would within each window of k rounds. Our\ndefinition is parametrized by a set of experts, which can include both fixed\nand adaptive defender strategies.\n  We investigate the inherent complexity of and design algorithms for adaptive\nregret minimization in bounded memory games of perfect and imperfect\ninformation. We prove a hardness result showing that, with imperfect\ninformation, any k-adaptive regret minimizing algorithm (with fixed strategies\nas experts) must be inefficient unless NP=RP even when playing against an\noblivious adversary. In contrast, for bounded memory games of perfect and\nimperfect information we present approximate 0-adaptive regret minimization\nalgorithms against an oblivious adversary running in time n^{O(1)}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 23:49:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 19:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 15:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 22:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 19:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

The coordinate z in AdS space is identified with a Lorentz-invariant\ncoordinate zeta which measures the separation of the constituents within a\nhadron at equal light-front time and determines the off-shell dynamics of the\nbound-state wavefunctions and the fall-off in the invariant mass of the\nconstituents. The soft-wall holographic model, modified by a positive-sign\ndilaton metric, leads to a remarkable one-parameter description of\nnonperturbative hadron dynamics -- a semi-classical frame-independent first\napproximation to the spectra and light-front wavefunctions of meson and\nbaryons.

By clicking the web\npages of Forbes, you may find all kinds of rankings, such as world's most\npowerful people, world's richest people, top-paid tennis stars, and so on and\nso forth. Herewith, we study a specific kind, sports ranking systems in which\nplayers' scores and prize money are calculated based on their performances in\nattending various tournaments. A typical example is tennis. It is found that\nthe distributions of both scores and prize money follow universal power laws,\nwith exponents nearly identical for most sports fields. In order to understand\nthe origin of this universal scaling we focus on the tennis ranking systems. By\nchecking the data we find that, for any pair of players, the probability that\nthe higher-ranked player will top the lower-ranked opponent is proportional to\nthe rank difference between the pair. Such a dependence can be well fitted to a\nsigmoidal function. By using this feature, we propose a simple toy model which\ncan simulate the competition of players in different tournaments. The\nsimulations yield results consistent with the empirical findings.

Specifically for a\nhomologously collapse of stellar core characterized by a polytropic exponent\n\\Gamma=4/3, we examine oscillations and/or instabilities of three dimensional\n(3D) general polytropic perturbations. For compressible 3D perturbations, the\npolytropic index \\gamma of perturbations can differ from \\Gamma=4/3 of the\ngeneral polytropic hydrodynamic background flow. Our model formulation here is\nmore general and allows the existence of internal gravity g(-)-modes and/or\ng(+)-modes. Eigenvalues and eigen-functions of various oscillatory and unstable\nperturbation modes are computed. As studied in several specialized cases of\nGoldreich & Weber and of Cao & Lou, we further confirm that acoustic p-modes\nand surface f-modes remain stable in the current more general situations. In\ncomparison, g(-)-modes and sufficiently high radial order g(+)-modes are\nunstable, leading to inevitable convective motions within the collapsing\nstellar interior. Unstable growths of 3D g-mode disturbances are governed\ndominantly by the angular momentum conservation and modified by the gas\npressure restoring force. We note in particular that unstable temporal growths\nof 3D vortical perturbations exist even when the specific entropy distribution\nbecomes uniform and \\gamma=\\Gamma=4/3. Conceptually, unstable g-modes might\nbear conceivable physical consequences on supernova explosions, the initial\nkicks of nascent proto-neutron stars (PNSs) and break-ups of the collapsing\ncore, while unstable growths of vortical perturbations can lead to fast spins\nof compact objects and other relevant results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2011 15:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}
