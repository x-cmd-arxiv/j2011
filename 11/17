Metals provide high conductivity to realize a\nstrong resonant response in metamaterials; however, they contribute very little\nto the tunability. The complex conductivity in high-temperature superconducting\nfilms is highly sensitive to external perturbations, which provides new\nopportunities in achieving tunable metamaterials resulting directly from the\nresonant elements. Here we demonstrate ultrafast dynamical tuning of resonance\nin the terahertz (THz) frequency range in YBa_2Cu_3O_7-\\delta (YBCO) split-ring\nresonator arrays excited by near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses. The\nphotoexcitation breaks the superconducting Cooper pairs to create the\nquasiparticle state. This dramatically modifies the imaginary part of the\ncomplex conductivity and consequently the metamaterial resonance in an\nultrafast timescale. We observed resonance switching accompanied with a wide\nrange frequency tuning as a function of photoexcitation fluence, which also\nstrongly depend on the nano-scale thickness of the superconducting films. All\nof our experimental results are well reproduced through calculations using an\nanalytical model, which takes into account the SRR resistance and kinetic\ninductance contributed from the complex conductivity of YBCO films. The\ntheoretical calculations reveal that the increasing SRR resistance upon\nincreasing photoexcitation fluence is responsible for the reduction of\nresonance strength, and both the resistance and kinetic inductance contribute\nto the tuning of resonance frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 19:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-17"}

The low disc fractions for high-mass stars in USco (and the other\nclusters) are consistent with an evolutionary decline in inner disc frequency\nwith age. However, BD disc fractions are higher than those for the stars in 1-3\nMyr clusters, but very low in the ~5 Myr old USco.

The disc\nfrequencies for BDs do not show any dependence on the stellar density or the\nBD/star number ratio in a cluster.

In this paper, we study both the\nfull- and half-duplex modes. In each mode, we propose two new coding schemes\nbuilt successively upon one another to illustrate the impact of different\ncoding techniques. The first scheme called partial decode-forward binning\n(PDF-binning) combines the ideas of partial decode-forward relaying and\nGelfand-Pinsker binning. The second scheme called Han-Kobayashi partial\ndecode-forward binning (HK-PDF-binning) combines PDF-binning with Han-Kobayashi\ncoding by further splitting rates and applying superposition coding,\nconditional binning and relaxed joint decoding.\n  In both schemes, the second sender decodes a part of the message from the\nfirst sender, then uses Gelfand-Pinsker binning technique to bin against the\ndecoded codeword, but in such a way that allows both state nullifying and\nforwarding. For the Gaussian channels, this PDF-binning essentializes to a\ncorrelation between the transmit signal and the binning state, which\nencompasses the traditional dirty-paper-coding binning as a special case when\nthis correlation factor is zero. We also provide the closed-form optimal\nbinning parameter for each scheme.\n  The 2-phase half-duplex schemes are adapted from the full-duplex ones by\nremoving block Markov encoding, sending different message parts in different\nphases and applying joint decoding across both phases. Analysis shows that the\nHK-PDF-binning scheme in both modes encompasses the Han-Kobayashi rate region\nand achieves both the partial decode-forward relaying rate for the first sender\nand interference-free rate for the second sender. Furthermore, this scheme\noutperforms all existing schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 21:14:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 02:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-08"}

This idea is strongly supported by\nthe fact that the abundance pattern in many metal-poor stars matches well the\ninferred Solar r-process abundance pattern in the mass range between the second\nand third r-process abundance peaks. Nevertheless, a significant number of\nmetal-poor stars do not share this standard r-process template. In this Letter\nwe suggest that the nuclides observed in many of these stars are produced by\nthe r-process, but that it is prevented from running to completion in more\nmassive stars by collapse to black holes before the r-process is completed,\ncreating a \"truncated r-process,\" or \"tr-process.\" We find that the observed\nfraction of tr-process stars is qualitatively what one would expect from the\ninitial mass function, and that an apparent sharp truncation observed at around\nmass 160 could result from a combination of collapses to black holes and the\ndifficulty of observing the higher mass rare earths.

Various peculiarities in the monthly Dst index are\ncorrelated better with the fine structures in the CME speed profile than that\nin the ISSN data. (2) Unlike the sunspot numbers, the CME speed index does not\nexhibit a double peak maximum. Instead, the CME speed profile peaks during the\ndeclining phase of solar cycle 23. Similar to the Ap index, both CME speed and\nthe Dst indices lag behind the sunspot numbers by several months. (3) The CME\nnumber shows a double peak similar to that seen in the sunspot numbers. The CME\noccurrence rate remained very high even near the minimum of the solar cycle 23,\nwhen both the sunspot number and the CME average maximum speed were reaching\ntheir minimum values. (4) A well-defined peak of the Ap index between 2002 May\nand 2004 August was co-temporal with the excess of the mid-latitude coronal\nholes during solar cycle 23.

Instead of the vortices driving conventional Fermi liquid into\nquantum spin liquid states in 2D, it is the vortex lines to lead to the\ninstability of Fermi liquid in 3D. The extended formalism can result in rich\nconsequences when the vortex lines condense in different degrees of freedom.\nFor example, when the vortex lines condense in charge phase degrees of freedom,\nthe resulting effective fermionic action is found to be equivalent to that\nobtained by well-studied slave-particle approaches for Hubbard and/or Anderson\nlattice models, which confirm the validity of the extended dual formalism in\n3D. When the vortex lines condense in spin phase degrees of freedom, a doublon\nmetal with a spin gap and an instability to the unconventional superconducting\npairing can be obtained. In addition, when the vortex lines condense in both\nphase degrees, an exotic doubled U(1) gauge theory occurs which describes a\nseparation of spin-opposite fermionic excitations.

Attaining this requires the receiver to make joint-detection\nmeasurements on long codeword blocks, optical implementations of which remain\nunknown. We report the first experimental demonstration of a joint-detection\nreceiver, demodulating quaternary pulse-position-modulation (PPM) codewords at\na word error rate of up to 40% (2.2 dB) below that attained with\ndirect-detection, the largest error-rate improvement over the standard quantum\nlimit reported to date. This is accomplished with a conditional nulling\nreceiver, which uses optimized-amplitude coherent pulse nulling, single photon\ndetection and quantum feedforward. We further show how this translates into\ncoding complexity improvements for practical PPM systems, such as in deep-space\ncommunication.

However, analysis of 84 Chandra ACIS observations, an\nHST ACS/WFC observation, and a 60 ks XMM-Newton observation has supplied new\nevidence that RX J0042.3+4115 is indeed a black hole binary. The brightest\noptical star within 3 sigma of the position of RX J0042.3+4115 had a F435W (~B)\nmagnitude of 25.4+/-0.2; M_B > -0.4, hence we find a low mass donor likely.

Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and\ntheir natural 2-dimensional nearest neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an\nobvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems.\nWhile fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants,\ntwo of which are the planar- and defect- based codes. Planar codes require\nfewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are\nrestricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between\nencoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the\ninherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique\nenabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations,\nmaintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique\ncomprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform\nuniversal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing\nthe need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the\noverall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further\nreduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding. We show how\nlattice surgery allows us to distribute encoded GHZ states in a more direct\n(and overhead friendly) manner, and how a demonstration of an encoded CNOT\nbetween two distance 3 logical states is possible with 53 physical qubits, half\nof that required in any other known construction in 2D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 06:01:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2011 20:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 12:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

We begin with revisiting\ngyroresonance acceleration by taking into account the fluctuations of grain\nguiding center along a uniform magnetic field (i.e. nonlinear theory--NLT). We\ncalculate grain velocities due to gyroresonance by fast MHD modes using the NLT\nfor different phases of the ISM, and compare with results obtained using\nquasi-linear theory (QLT). We find for the parameters applicable to the typical\nISM phases that the fluctuations of grain guiding center reduce grain\nvelocities by less than 15 percent, but they can be important for more special\ncircumstances. We confirm that large grains can be accelerated to\nsuper-Alfvenic velocities through gyroresonance. For such super-Alfvenic\ngrains, we investigate the effect of further acceleration via transit time\ndamping (TTD) by fast modes. We find that due to the broadening of resonance\ncondition in the NLT, the TTD acceleration is not only important for the\ncosines of grain pitch angle relative to the magnetic field mu>V_{A}/v, but\nalso for mu<V_{A}/v where v is the grain velocity and V_{A} is the Alfven\nspeed. We show that the TTD acceleration is dominant over the gyroresonance for\nlarge grains, and can increase substantially grain velocities induced by\ngyroresonance acceleration. We quantify another stochastic acceleration\nmechanism arising from low frequency Alfven waves. We discuss the range of\napplicability of the mechanisms and their implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 06:30:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 02:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Precise\nrelative ages and orbital parameters are determined for 67 halo and 16\nthick-disk stars having metallicities in the range -1.4 < [Fe/H] < -0.4 to\nbetter understand the context of the two halo populations in the formation and\nevolution of the Galaxy. Ages are derived by comparing the positions of stars\nin the logT_{eff}-log(g) diagram with isochrones from the Y^2 models\ninterpolated to the exact [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] values of each star. Possible\nsystematic errors in T_{eff} and log(g) are considered and corrected. With\nspace velocities from Paper I as initial conditions, orbital integrations have\nbeen carried out using a detailed, observationally constrained Milky Way model\nincluding a bar and spiral arms. The `high-alpha' halo stars have ages 2-3 Gyr\nlarger than the `low-alpha' ones. The orbital parameters show very distinct\ndifferences between the `high-alpha' and `low-alpha' halo stars. The\n`low-alpha' ones have r_{max}'s to 30-40 kpc, z_{max}'s to approx. 18 kpc, and\ne_{max}'s clumped at values greater than 0.85, while the `high-alpha' ones,\nr_{max}'s to about 16 kpc, z_{max}'s to 6-8 kpc, and e_{max} more or less\nuniformly distributed over 0.4-1.0. A dual in situ-plus-accretion formation\nscenario best explains the existence and characteristics of these two halo\npopulations, but one remaining defect is that this model is not consistent\nregarding the r_{max}'s obtained for the in situ `high-alpha' component; the\npredicted values are too small. It appears that omega Cen may have contributed\nin a significant way to the existence of the `low-alpha' component; recent\nmodels, including dynamical friction and tidal stripping, have produced orbital\nparameters as great as those of the `low-alpha' component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 06:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

For all events, we measure the linear\nlimb-darkening coefficients of the surface brightness profile of source stars\nby measuring the deviation of the light curves near the peak affected by the\nfinite-source effect. For 7 events, we measure the Einstein radii and the\nlens-source relative proper motions. Among them, 5 events are found to have\nEinstein radii less than 0.2 mas, making the lenses candidates of very low-mass\nstars or brown dwarfs. For MOA-2011-BLG-274, especially, the small Einstein\nradius of $\\theta_{\\rm E}\\sim 0.08$ mas combined with the short time scale of\n$t_{\\rm E}\\sim 2.7$ days suggests the possibility that the lens is a\nfree-floating planet. For MOA-2009-BLG-174, we measure the lens parallax and\nthus uniquely determine the physical parameters of the lens. We also find that\nthe measured lens mass of $\\sim 0.84\\ M_\\odot$ is consistent with that of a\nstar blended with the source, suggesting that the blend is likely to be the\nlens. Although we find planetary signals for none of events, we provide\nexclusion diagrams showing the confidence levels excluding the existence of a\nplanet as a function of the separation and mass ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 08:29:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 10:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Using this, one can study\ncorrelation functions involving any given number of propagating spin clusters\nwith prescribed colours, each of which contains any given number of distinct FK\nclusters.

The filament first underwent a full development within 46 minutes\nand then began to erupt 9 minutes later, followed by a compact, impulsive X-ray\nclass M2.2 flare with a two ribbon nature only at the early eruption phase.\nDuring the eruption, its top rose, whereas the two legs remained rooted in the\nchromosphere and swelled little perpendicular to the rising direction. This led\nto a surge-like eruption with a narrow angular extent. Similar to the recent\nobservations for standard and blowout X-ray jets by Moore et al., we thus\ndefine it as a \"blowout H_alpha surge\". Furthermore, our observations showed\nthat the eruption was associated with (1) a coronal mass ejection guided by a\npreexisting streamer, (2) abrupt, significant, and persistent changes in the\nphotospheric magnetic field around the filament, and (3) sudden disappearance\nof a small pore. These observations thus provide evidence that blowout surge is\na small-scale version of large-scale filament eruption in many aspects. Our\nobservations further suggest that at least part of H_alpha surges belong to\nblowout-type ones, and exact distinction between standard and blowout H_alpha\nsurges is important in understanding their different origins and associated\neruptive phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 09:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This study provides a generalization of\nthe Jeans paradigm for determining the critical scale above which gravitational\ncollapse is allowed. We start by discussing the stability of an ideal\nself-gravitating plasma embedded in a constant magnetic field. We outline the\nexistence of an anisotropic feature of the gravitational collapse. In fact,\nwhile in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field the Jeans length is\nenhanced by the contribution of the magnetic pressure, outside this plane\nperturbations are governed by the usual Jeans criterium. The anisotropic\ncollapse of a density contrast is sketched in details, suggesting that the\nlinear evolution provides anisotropic initial conditions for the non-linear\nstage, where this effect could be strongly enforced. The same problem is then\nfaced in the presence of non-zero resistivity and the conditions for the\ngravitational collapse are correspondingly extended. The relevant feature\nemerging in this resistive scenario is the cancellation of the collapse\nanisotropy in weakly conducting plasmas. In this case, the instability of a\nself-gravitating resistive plasma is characterized by the standard isotropic\nJeans length in any directions. The limit of very small resistivity coefficient\nis finally addressed, elucidating how reminiscence of the collapse anisotropy\ncan be found in the different value of the perturbation frequency inside and\noutside the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 10:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Finally, another type of \"no-go\" tests (an instance\nof which we examine here) also present subtleties which call for serious\nexamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 13:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 11:41:00 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2012 07:37:27 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 17:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 04:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 13:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Sun, 20 May 2012 13:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2012 10:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2012 05:38:04 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 14:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 11:38:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 20:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v20","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 03:23:32 GMT"},{"version":"v21","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 15:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v22","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 14:14:39 GMT"},{"version":"v23","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 02:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v24","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 11:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v25","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 11:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v26","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 13:44:05 GMT"},{"version":"v27","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 14:58:18 GMT"},{"version":"v28","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 02:18:37 GMT"},{"version":"v29","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 13:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 20:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v30","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 01:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v31","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 09:16:33 GMT"},{"version":"v32","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 03:28:44 GMT"},{"version":"v33","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 01:32:58 GMT"},{"version":"v34","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 07:47:47 GMT"},{"version":"v35","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 01:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v36","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2013 10:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v37","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 07:12:13 GMT"},{"version":"v38","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 01:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v39","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 16:15:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2011 11:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v40","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 09:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v41","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 09:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v42","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 14:39:57 GMT"},{"version":"v43","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 00:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v44","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2013 13:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v45","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 03:20:29 GMT"},{"version":"v46","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 10:18:35 GMT"},{"version":"v47","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 11:52:32 GMT"},{"version":"v48","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 05:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v49","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 03:16:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 15:21:14 GMT"},{"version":"v50","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 02:31:37 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 16:39:24 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 14:43:37 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 14:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 06:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The influence of\nexperimental parameters on the classical hologram reconstruction methods is\nassessed, offering guidelines for optimal image rendering regarding the\nhologram recording conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 15:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-18"}

For the range of 2D\nparameters where such surface may modelize a thin shell of an isotropic elastic\nmaterial, the mode of deformation that develops a single depression is\ninvestigated in detail. It first occurs via buckling from sphere toward an\naxisymmetric dimple, followed by a second buckling where the depression loses\nits axisymmetry, by folding along portions of meridians. We could exhibit\nunifying master curves for the relative volume variation at which first and\nsecond buckling occur, and clarify the role of the Poisson's ratio. After the\nsecond buckling, the number of folds and inner pressure are investigated,\nallowing to infer shell features from mere observation and/or knowledge of\nexternal constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 15:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 09:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 13:47:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 09:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-31"}

In the\nset-up considered here, by keeping the genuine thermodynamical temperature\nconstant, we may single out the role that curvature effects play on the\nbreaking/restoration of chiral symmetry and on the appearance of inhomogeneous\nphases. The first goal of this paper is to construct a general expression of\nthe finite temperature effective action for inhomogeneous condensates in the\ncase of four-fermion effective field theories on conifold geometries with\ngeneric Riemannian smooth base (generalised cones). The other goal is to\nimplement numerically the above formal results and construct self-consistent\nsolutions for the condensate.

We derive a\nquantum master equation (ME) in the polaron frame which includes exciton-phonon\nand exciton-cavity coupling to all orders. This work details and extends the\ntheory used in a recent issue of {\\em Physical Review Letters} (C. Roy and S.\nHughes 2011: Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 106} 247403) to describe the QD Mollow\ntriplet in the regime of semiconductor cavity-QED. Here we introduce two ME\nforms, Nakajima-Zwanzig (NZ) and time-convolutionless (TC), both to second\norder in the system--phonon-reservoir perturbation. In the polaron frame, these\ntwo ME forms are shown to yield equivalent population dynamics and fluorescence\nspectra for a continuous wave (cw) driving field. We also demonstrate that a\nMarkov approximation is valid for computing the incoherent scattering processes\nand we subsequently exploit the Markovian TC ME to explore the resonance\nfluorescence spectra of an exciton-driven QD. Both cavity-emitted and\nexciton-emitted spectra are studied and these are found to have qualitatively\ndifferent spectral features. Using a coherent driving field, the well known\ncharacteristics of the atomic Mollow triplet are shown to be considerably\nmodified with electron--acoustic-phonon scattering and we highlight the key\neffects arising from both cavity coupling and electron-phonon coupling. Regimes\nof pronounced cavity feeding and anharmonic cavity-QED are exemplified, and we\nfind that the cavity coupling depends sensitively on the exciton-cavity\ndetuning and the temperature of the phonon bath. We show how the full width at\nhalf maximum (linewidth) of the Mollow triplet sidebands varies as a function\nof the square of the Rabi frequency of the cw pump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 18:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 16:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
