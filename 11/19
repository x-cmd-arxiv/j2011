In many\nsituations, however, the covariates can be considered to be structured, in that\nthe selection of some variables favours the selection of others -- with\nvariables organised into groups entering or leaving the model simultaneously as\na special case.

We use data\nfrom the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) which have been\nre- processed by the CFHT Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) team in order to carry out\na number of weak gravitational lensing studies. An emphasis is put on the\ncorrection of systematic effects in the photo-z's arising from the different\nPoint Spread Functions (PSF) in the five optical bands. Different ways of\ncorrecting these effects are discussed and the resulting photo-z accuracies are\nquantified by comparing the photo-z's to large spectroscopic redshift (spec-z)\ndata sets. Careful homogenisation of the PSF between bands leads to increased\noverall accuracy of photo-z's. The gain is particularly pronounced at fainter\nmagnitudes where galaxies are smaller and flux measurements are affected more\nby PSF-effects. We also study possible re- calibrations of the photometric\nzeropoints (ZPs) with the help of galaxies with known spec-z's. We find that if\nPSF-effects are properly taken into account, a re-calibration of the ZPs\nbecomes much less important suggesting that previous such re-calibrations\ndescribed in the literature could in fact be mostly corrections for PSF-effects\nrather than corrections for real inaccuracies in the ZPs. The implications of\nthis finding for future surveys like KiDS, DES, LSST, or Euclid are mixed. On\nthe one hand, ZP re-calibrations with spec-z's might not be as accurate as\npreviously thought. On the other hand, careful PSF homogenisation might provide\na way out and yield accurate, homogeneous photometry without the need for full\nspectroscopic coverage.

Important differences\nin the structure formation were observed between the experiments where the\nparticles were allowed to sediment and those where sedimentation was averaged\nout.

Initially there is a zero vector\nfield and an \"empty\" phase space with no attractors or other non-trivial\nobjects. As the random stimulus begins, the vector field deforms and eventually\nbecomes smooth and deterministic, despite the random nature of the applied\nforce, while the phase space develops various geometrical objects. We consider\ngradient self-shaping systems, whose vector field is the gradient of some\nenergy function, which under certain conditions develops into the\nmulti-dimensional probability density distribution (PDD) of the input.\nSelf-shaping systems are relevant to neural networks (NNs) of two types:\nHopfield, and probabilistic. Firstly, we show that they can potentially perform\npattern recognition tasks traditionally delegated to Hopfield NNs, but without\nsupervision and on-line, and without developing spurious minima of the energy.\nSecondly, like probabilistic NNs, they can reconstruct the PDD of input\nsignals, without the limitation that new training patterns have to enter as new\nhardware units. Thus, self-shaping systems can be regarded as a generalization\nof the NN concept, achieved by abandoning the \"rigid units\" - \"flexible\ncouplings\" paradigm and making the vector field fully flexible and amenable to\nexternal force. The new concept presents an engineering challenge requiring new\nprinciples of hardware design. It might also become an alternative paradigm for\nmodeling of living and learning systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2011 17:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-08"}

Subgrid models of AGN activity in a galaxy evolution context so far\nhave been mostly focused on the quenching of star formation. To shed more light\non the actual physics of the \"radio mode\" part of AGN activity, we have\nperformed simulations of the interaction of a powerful AGN jet with the massive\ngaseous disc (10^11 solar masses) of a high-redshift galaxy. We spatially\nresolve both the jet and the clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and\ninclude an explicit star formation model in the simulation.

This results in a ring- or disc-shaped population of young stars. At later\ntimes, the increase in star formation rate also occurs in the disc regions\nfurther out since the jet cocoon pressurizes the ISM. The total mass of the\nadditionally formed stars may be up to 10^10 solar masses for one duty cycle.\nWe discuss the details of this jet-induced star formation (positive feedback)\nand its potential consequences for galaxy evolution and observable signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2011 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 19:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-13"}

The symmetries of the\nmodel stabilize the dark matter and forbid the introduction of new mass\nparameters. As a result, the thermal relic density is completely determined by\nthe gravitino mass and dimensionless couplings. Assuming non-hierarchical\ncouplings, the thermal relic density is ~ 0.1, independent of the dark matter's\nmass and interaction strength, realizing the WIMPless miracle. The model has\nseveral striking features. For particle physics, stability of the dark matter\nis completely consistent with R-parity violation in the visible sector, with\nimplications for superpartner collider signatures; also the thermal relic's\nmass may be ~ 10 GeV or lighter, which is of interest given recent direct\ndetection results. Interesting astrophysical signatures are dark matter\nself-interactions through a long-range force, and massless hidden photons and\nfermions that contribute to the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at\nBBN and CMB.

Our work is based on a compositional analysis of the 10 and 20\nmicron silicate emission features for brown dwarfs in the Taurus-Auriga\nstar-forming region. A fundamental finding of our work is that brown dwarfs\nexhibit stronger signs of dust processing in the cold component of the disk,\ncompared to the higher mass T Tauri stars in Taurus. For nearly all of our\ntargets, we find a flat disk structure, which is consistent with the stronger\nsigns of dust processing observed in these disks. For the case of one brown\ndwarf, 2M04230607, we find the forsterite mass fraction to be a factor of ~3\nhigher in the outer disk compared to the inner disk region. Simple large-scale\nradial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemical\ncomposition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective in\nthis disk. The relatively high abundance of crystalline silicates in the outer\ncold regions of brown dwarf disks provides an interesting analogy to comets. In\nthis context, we have discussed the applicability of the various mechanisms\nthat have been proposed for comets on the formation and the outward transport\nof high-temperature material. We also present Chandra X-ray observations for\ntwo Taurus brown dwarfs, 2M04414825 and CFHT-BD-Tau 9. We find 2M04414825,\nwhich has a ~12% crystalline mass fraction, to be more than an order of\nmagnitude brighter in X-ray than CFHT-BD-Tau 9, which has a ~35% crystalline\nmass fraction. Combining with previous X-ray data, we find the inner disk\ncrystalline mass fractions to be anti-correlated with the X-ray strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2011 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

The Coriolis component of the\nhorizontal tidal force in the rotating reference frame tends to disrupt such\nmarginally bound pairs. However, even extremely wide pairs of bodies can be\nbound over intervals of time comparable to the Hubble time, under appropriate\ninitial conditions. Here we show that for arbitrary chosen initial coordinates\nof a pair of stars, there exists a volume of the space of initial velocity\ncomponents where the orbits remain bound in the planar tidal field for longer\nthan 10 Gyr, even though the initial separation is well outside the Jacobi\nradius. The boundary of this phase space of stable orbits is fractal, and the\nmotion at the boundary conditions is clearly chaotic. We found that the pairs\nmay remain confined for several Gyr, and then suddenly disintegrate due to a\nparticularly close rendezvous. By reversing such long-term stable orbits, we\nfind that entrapment of unrelated stars into wide pairs is possible, but should\nbe quite rare.

The accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1626-67 experienced a new torque\nreversal at the beginning of 2008, after about 18 years of steadily spinning\ndown. The main goal of the present work is to study this recent torque reversal\nthat occurred in 2008 February.\n  Methods. We present a spectral analysis of this source using two pointed\nobservations performed by Suzaku in 2006 March and in 2010 September.\n  Results. We confirm with Suzaku the presence of a strong emission-line\ncomplex centered on 1 keV, with the strongest line being the hydrogen-like Ne\nLy-alpha at 1.025(3) keV. We were able to resolve this complex with up to seven\nemission lines. A dramatic increase of the intensity of the Ne Ly-alpha line\nafter the 2008 torque reversal occurred, with the equivalent width of this line\nreaching almost the same value measured by ASCA in 1993. We also report on the\ndetection of a cyclotron line feature centered at ~37 keV. In spite of the fact\nthat an increase of the X-ray luminosity (0.5-100 keV) of a factor of ~2.8\noccurred between these two observations, no significant change in the energy of\nthe cyclotron line feature was observed.

After selection effects, the\ndistribution for \\tilde{m} may prefer larger values. A single environmental\nconstraint from dark matter can then lead to multi-component dark matter,\nincluding both axions and the LSP, giving a TeV-scale LSP lighter than the\ncorresponding value for single-component LSP dark matter.\n  If SUSY breaking is mediated to the SM sector at order X^* X, only squarks,\nsleptons and one Higgs doublet acquire masses of order \\tilde{m}. The gravitino\nmass is lighter by a factor of M_*/M_Pl and the gaugino masses are suppressed\nby a further loop factor. This Spread SUSY spectrum has two versions; the\nHiggsino masses are generated in one from supergravity giving a wino LSP and in\nthe other radiatively giving a Higgsino LSP. The environmental restriction on\ndark matter fixes the LSP mass to the TeV domain, so that the squark and\nslepton masses are order 10^3 TeV and 10^6 TeV in these two schemes. We study\nthe spectrum, dark matter and collider signals of these two versions of Spread\nSUSY. The Higgs is SM-like and lighter than 145 GeV; monochromatic photons in\ncosmic rays arise from dark matter annihilations in the halo; exotic short\ncharged tracks occur at the LHC, at least for the wino LSP; and there are the\neventual possibilities of direct detection of dark matter and detailed\nexploration of the TeV-scale states at a future linear collider. Gauge coupling\nunification is as in minimal SUSY theories.\n  If SUSY breaking is mediated at order X, a much less hierarchical spectrum\nresults---similar to that of the MSSM, but with the superpartner masses 1--2\norders of magnitude larger than in natural theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2011 00:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In contrast to most earlier work, where only reliable\nsynaptic connections are considered, we mainly examine the effects of\nunreliable synapses on both types of neural activity propagation in this work.\nWe first study networks composed of purely excitatory neurons. Our results show\nthat both the successful transmission probability and excitatory synaptic\nstrength largely influence the propagation of these two types of neural\nactivities, and better tuning of these synaptic parameters makes the considered\nnetwork support stable signal propagation. It is also found that noise has\nsignificant but different impacts on these two types of propagation. The\nadditive Gaussian white noise has the tendency to reduce the precision of the\nsynfire activity, whereas noise with appropriate intensity can enhance the\nperformance of firing rate propagation. Further simulations indicate that the\npropagation dynamics of the considered neuronal network is not simply\ndetermined by the average amount of received neurotransmitter for each neuron\nin a time instant, but also largely influenced by the stochastic effect of\nneurotransmitter release. Second, we compare our results with those obtained in\ncorresponding feedforward neuronal networks connected with reliable synapses\nbut in a random coupling fashion. We confirm that some differences can be\nobserved in these two different feedforward neuronal network models. Finally,\nwe study the signal propagation in feedforward neuronal networks consisting of\nboth excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and demonstrate that inhibition also\nplays an important role in signal propagation in the considered networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2011 02:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Owing to the\ndetailed temporal coverage and the extended wavelength range (3000--24800 A),\nwe obtained an unprecedentedly rich spectral sequence among the hypernovae,\nmaking SN 2010bh one of the best studied representatives of this SN class.

During the\nstorage process, traditional erasure codes require a unique source node to\ncreate and upload all the redundant data to the different storage nodes.\nHowever, such a source node may have limited communication and computation\ncapabilities, which constrain the storage process throughput. Moreover, the\nsource node and the different storage nodes might not be able to send and\nreceive data simultaneously -- e.g., nodes might be busy in a datacenter\nsetting, or simply be offline in a peer-to-peer setting -- which can further\nthreaten the efficacy of the overall storage process. In this paper we propose\nan \"in-network\" redundancy generation process which distributes the data\ninsertion load among the source and storage nodes by allowing the storage nodes\nto generate new redundant data by exchanging partial information among\nthemselves, improving the throughput of the storage process. The process is\ncarried out asynchronously, utilizing spare bandwidth and computing resources\nfrom the storage nodes.

Within the classical sampling framework, state of the art systems\nreduce processing rates by exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected\nsignals. It has been recently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate\nreduction may be obtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite\nRate of Innovation framework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which\ncombines classic methods from sampling theory with recent developments in\nCompressed Sensing. Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual\ntransducer elements, which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is\nlimited by the noisy nature of the signals. This often results in erroneous\nparameter extraction, bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the\nlow-rate samples.
