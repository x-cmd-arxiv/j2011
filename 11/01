These results have, however, shown that a fully\nsatisfactory interpretative framework of the GRB phenomena is still lacking.\nThe MAGIC telescope opens the possibility to extend the measurement of GRBs in\nthe several tens up to hundreds of GeV energy range. From the theoretical point\nof view, both leptonic and hadronic processes have been suggested to explain\nthe possible GeV/TeV counterpart of GRBs. Observations with ground-based\ntelescopes of very high energy photons (E>30 GeV) from these sources are going\nto play a key role in discriminating among the different proposed emission\nmechanisms which are barely distinguishable at lower energies. MAGIC telescope\nobservations of the GRB090102 (z=1.547) field from 03:14:52 UT to 06:54:01 UT\nare analyzed to derive upper limits to the GeV/TeV emission. We compare these\nresults to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in the\nframework of the standard fireball model. The results we obtained are\ncompatible with the expected emission but cannot yet set further constraints on\nthe theoretical scenario. However, the difficulty in modeling the low energy\ndata for this event makes it difficult to fix in an unambiguous way the\nphysical parameters which describe the fireball. Nonetheless, the MAGIC\ntelescope, thanks to its low energy threshold and fast repositioning, is\nopening for the first time the possibility to fill the energy gap between\nspace-based gamma detectors and the ground-based measurements. This will makes\npossible GRBs multiwavelength studies in the very high energy domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 16:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In accordance with\nrealistic subhalo models and current observational constraints on\nself-annihilating dark matter, we predict that about one massive Galactic\nsubhalo may have already been detected in the 11-months catalog of Fermi-LAT\ndata (1FGL). Selection cuts applied to the 1FGL reveal twelve possible\ncandidates, and in-depth studies of the most promising object, 1FGL\nJ0030.7+0724, are presented. In a dedicated X-ray follow-up observation with\nthe Swift XRT, seven point-like X-ray sources have been discovered. Within the\npositional uncertainty derived from the 24-months Fermi-LAT data, we consider\nthe unidentified radio source NVSS J003119+072456, coinciding with one of the\ndiscovered Swift sources, as the most promising counterpart candidate for 1FGL\nJ0030.7+0724. The broad-band spectral energy distribution is consistent with a\nhigh-energy-peaked blazar. However, flux and extent of the Fermi source may\nalso be compatible with a dark matter subhalo.

Sgr A*, the resident\nSMBH of the Milky Way, produces (by comparison) tiny flares that last only\nhours but occur daily. Here we explore the possibility that these flares could\nbe produced by disruption of smaller bodies - asteroids. We show that asteroids\npassing within an AU of Sgr A* could be split into smaller fragments which then\nvaporise by bodily friction with the tenuous quiescent gas accretion flow onto\nSgr A*. The ensuing shocks and plasma instabilities may create a transient\npopulation of very hot electrons invoked in several currently popular models\nfor Sgr A* flares, thus producing the required spectra. We estimate that\nasteroids larger than ~ 10 km in size are needed to power the observed flares,\nwith the maximum possible luminosity of the order 10^39 erg s^-1. Assuming that\nthe asteroid population per parent star in the central parsec of the Milky Way\nis not too dissimilar from that around stars in the Solar neighbourhood, we\nestimate the asteroid disruption rates, and the distribution of the expected\nluminosities, finding a reasonable agreement with the observations. We also\nnote that planets may be tidally disrupted by Sgr A* as well, also very\ninfrequently.

The\norigin of the abundance anomalies observed in late B-type stars with HgMn\npeculiarity is still poorly understood. The connection between HgMn peculiarity\nand membership in binary and multiple systems is supported by our observations\nduring the last decade. The important result achieved in our studies of a large\nsample of HgMn stars is the finding that most HgMn stars exhibit spectral\nvariability of various chemical elements, proving that the presence of an\ninhomogeneous distribution on the surface of these stars is a rather common\ncharacteristic and not a rare phenomenon.

The rest of\nthe spectrum, including the squarks of the first two generations, can be\nheavier and beyond the current LHC reach. We have used collider simulations to\ndetermine the limits that all of the 1/fb searches pose on higgsinos, stops,\nand the gluino. We find that stops and the left-handed sbottom are starting to\nbe constrained and must be heavier than about 200-300 GeV when decaying to\nhiggsinos. The gluino must be heavier than about 600-800 GeV when it decays to\nstops and sbottoms.

Among all the searches, jets plus missing energy and\nsame-sign dileptons often provide the most powerful probes of natural SUSY.\nOverall, our results indicate that natural SUSY has survived the first 1/fb of\ndata.

This stochastic spiking coherence may be well visualized in the raster\nplot of neural spikes. For a coherent case, partially-occupied \"stripes\"\n(composed of spikes and indicating collective coherence) are formed in the\nraster plot. This partial occupation occurs due to \"stochastic spike skipping\"\nwhich is well shown in the multi-peaked interspike interval histogram. The main\npurpose of our work is to quantitatively measure the degree of stochastic\nspiking coherence seen in the raster plot. We introduce a new spike-based\ncoherence measure $M_s$ by considering the occupation pattern and the pacing\npattern of spikes in the stripes. In particular, the pacing degree between\nspikes is determined in a statistical-mechanical way by quantifying the average\ncontribution of (microscopic) individual spikes to the (macroscopic)\nensemble-averaged global potential. This \"statistical-mechanical\" measure $M_s$\nis in contrast to the conventional measures such as the \"thermodynamic\" order\nparameter (which concerns the time-averaged fluctuations of the macroscopic\nglobal potential), the \"microscopic\" correlation-based measure (based on the\ncross-correlation between the microscopic individual potentials), and the\nmeasures of precise spike timing (based on the peri-stimulus time histogram).\nIn terms of $M_s$, we quantitatively characterize the stochastic spiking\ncoherence, and find that $M_s$ reflects the degree of collective spiking\ncoherence seen in the raster plot very well. Hence, the\n\"statistical-mechanical\" spike-based measure $M_s$ may be used usefully to\nquantify the degree of stochastic spiking coherence in a statistical-mechanical\nway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 19:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

The radial velocity (RV)\nsignature of Sgr has been identified among our follow-up spectroscopic data in\nfour of the six fields and combined with mean PMs of\nspectroscopically-confirmed members to derive space motions of Sgr debris based\non 15-64 confirmed stream members per field. These kinematics are compared to\npredictions of the Law & Majewski (2010) model of Sgr disruption; we find\nreasonable agreement with model predictions in RVs and PMs along Galactic\nlatitude. However, an upward adjustment of the Local Standard of Rest velocity\nTheta_LSR from its standard 220 km/s to at least $232\\pm14$ km/s (and possibly\nas high as $264\\pm23$ km/s) is necessary to bring 3-D model debris kinematics\nand our measurements into agreement. Satisfactory model fits that\nsimultaneously reproduce known position, distance, and radial velocity trends\nof the Sgr tidal streams, while significantly increasing Theta_LSR}, could only\nbe achieved by increasing the Galactic bulge and disk mass while leaving the\ndark matter halo fixed to the best-fit values from Law & Majewski (2010).

Although the electron\ndensities of the symmetry-conserving LLL states do not exhibit crystalline\npatterns, the intrinsic crystalline correlations are reflected in the\nconditional probability distributions and the emergence of cusp yrast states in\nthe LLL spectra. It is shown that away from the exact fractional fillings, weak\npinning perturbations (due to weak disorder) may overcome the energy gaps\nbetween adjacent global states and generate pinned broken symmetry ground\nstates as a superposition of symmetry-conserving LLL states with different\ntotal angular momenta. The electron densities of such mixed states (without\ngood angular momentum quantum numbers) exhibit oscillating patterns that\ncorrespond to molecular crystallites.

We confirm that a\nlinear cut-off of the planet distribution in the M^2/R^3 versus a^-2 plane is\nan expected result of population modification by evaporation and that the known\ntransiting exoplanets display such a cut-off. We find that for an evaporation\nefficiency of 25% we expect around 1 in 10 of the known transiting exoplanets\nto have lost > 5% of their mass since formation.

This\nraises the possibility of using evaporation histories to distinguish between\ndifferent migration scenarios. For planets with available spin-orbit angles no\ndifference is found between the distributions of planets with misaligned orbits\nand those with aligned orbits.

A relatively\nweak magnetic field is found to render the flow linearly unstable as two weak\njets appear close to the centre of the duct at the Hartmann number Ha \\approx\n9.6. In a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the instability following the\njets becomes confined in the layers of characteristic thickness \\delta \\sim\nHa^{-1/2} located at the walls parallel to the magnetic field.

Despite their manifest attractions, speech-act\nmodels of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for\ncommunication in artificial agent systems. In particular, it has proved to be\nextremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speech-act based agent\ncommunication languages. In part, the problem is that speech-act semantics\ntypically make reference to the \"mental states\" of agents (their beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions), and there is in general no way to attribute such\nattitudes to arbitrary computational agents. In addition, agent programming\nlanguages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract, stand-alone\nversions, neglecting aspects such as communication primitives. With respect to\ncommunication, implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather\nad hoc. This paper addresses both of these problems, by giving semantics to\nspeech-act based messages received by an AgentSpeak agent. AgentSpeak is a\nlogic-based agent programming language which incorporates the main features of\nthe PRS model of reactive planning systems. The paper builds upon a structural\noperational semantics to AgentSpeak that we developed in previous work. The\nmain contributions of this paper are as follows: an extension of our earlier\nwork on the theoretical foundations of AgentSpeak interpreters; a\ncomputationally grounded semantics for (the core) performatives used in\nspeech-act based agent communication languages; and a well-defined extension of\nAgentSpeak that supports agent communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 21:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-02"}

Quantitative modelling works best when the\nstructure of the model (i.e., the form of the equations) is known; and the\nprimary concern is one of estimating the values of the parameters in the model.\nFor complex biological systems, the model-structure is rarely known and the\nmodeler has to deal with both model-identification and parameter-estimation. In\nthis paper we are concerned with providing automated assistance to the first of\nthese problems. Specifically, we examine the identification by machine of the\nstructural relationships between experimentally observed variables. These\nrelationship will be expressed in the form of qualitative abstractions of a\nquantitative model. Such qualitative models may not only provide clues to the\nprecise quantitative model, but also assist in understanding the essence of\nthat model. Our position in this paper is that background knowledge\nincorporating system modelling principles can be used to constrain effectively\nthe set of good qualitative models.

Many real-life distributed problems that\narise in manufacturing, multi-robot coordination and information gathering\nscenarios can be formalized using this framework. However, finding the optimal\nsolution in the general case is hard, limiting the applicability of recently\ndeveloped algorithms. This paper provides a practical approach for solving\ndecentralized control problems when communication among the decision makers is\npossible, but costly. We develop the notion of communication-based mechanism\nthat allows us to decompose a decentralized MDP into multiple single-agent\nproblems. In this framework, referred to as decentralized semi-Markov decision\nprocess with direct communication (Dec-SMDP-Com), agents operate separately\nbetween communications. We show that finding an optimal mechanism is equivalent\nto solving optimally a Dec-SMDP-Com. We also provide a heuristic search\nalgorithm that converges on the optimal decomposition. Restricting the\ndecomposition to some specific types of local behaviors reduces significantly\nthe complexity of planning. In particular, we present a polynomial-time\nalgorithm for the case in which individual agents perform goal-oriented\nbehaviors between communications. The paper concludes with an additional\ntractable algorithm that enables the introduction of human knowledge, thereby\nreducing the overall problem to finding the best time to communicate. Empirical\nresults show that these approaches provide good approximate solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 22:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-02"}

A classical simple fluid with a locally\nintroduced field imitating a permeable solid is considered. The cases of micro-\nand macroscopically smooth boundary are examined and the analysis of static\nmembranes is performed. Henry constant of adsorption and its connection with\nHenry constant of absorption, specific surface grand potential (gamma) and the\nsurface number density are determined. High-temperature expansions and\nlow-temperature limit for basic values are obtained. \"The surface tension\ncoefficient\" decomposes into a value proportional to Henry constant of\nadsorption depending on the position of the separating surface, and a universal\nnonlinear surface coefficient. Two approaches to this problem are analyzed:\nthrough the surface cluster expansion and through the pressure tensor. Within\nthe first approach, the series in powers of activity is obtained for gamma.\nThis expression is similar to the cluster expansion for pressure but in\ncontrast to this case the integrals of Ursell factors contain the multipliers\ndepending on the potential of particles interaction with the external field.\nWithin the second approach, Kirkwood-Buff formula for gamma is extended for the\ncase of the field of finite value.

The spiking response of\nthe neuron to a complex, time-varying input can be predicted from the detailed\nbiophysical properties of the neuron, modeled as a deterministic nonlinear\ndynamical system. In the tradition of neural coding, however, a neuron or\nneural system is treated as a black box and statistical techniques are used to\nidentify functional models of its encoding properties. The goal of this work is\nto connect the mechanistic, biophysical approach to neuronal function to a\ndescription in terms of a coding model. Building from preceding work at the\nsingle neuron level, we develop from first principles a mathematical theory\nmapping the relationships between two simple but powerful classes of models:\ndeterministic integrate-and-fire dynamical models and linear-nonlinear coding\nmodels. To do so, we develop an approach for studying a nonlinear dynamical\nsystem by conditioning on an observed linear estimator. We derive asymptotic\nclosed-form expressions for the linear filter and estimates for the nonlinear\ndecision function of the linear/nonlinear model.

Combining our results with\nprevious studies, we find the millimeter-detection fraction of Class II sources\nhas significantly decreased from younger ages, and comparison with\nnear-infrared and Halpha measurements indicates the present disks have\nundergone significant evolution in composition or structure at all radii. The\ndisks of Upper Scorpius represent the tail-end of the depletion of primordial\ndisks; while a few near-solar mass stars may still sustain giant planet\nformation, this process has finished around higher mass stars\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2011 01:23:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 01:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It is found that introducing NNN to the 2D materials removes the\nsymmetry around the Fermi level and shifts it, at a small value of NNN hopping.\nThis effect increases with increasing NNN hopping. If the NNN hopping becomes\ncompetitive with nearest neighbor (NN) hopping, the dispersion relations of the\n2D materials changes completely from NN hopping dispersion relations. The\nresults show that the 2D material sensitivity for NNN hopping effect is much\nlarger in the 2D honeycomb lattice than 2D square lattice. This is due to the\nfact that the number of NNN sites is equal to six, which is the double of NN\nsites in the 2D honeycomb lattice. Meanwhile, the number of NNN sites is equal\nto four which is equal to NN sites in 2D square lattice.

Thus optimized thermopower, together with diminished phonon\nconductance through a ZGNR/molecule/ZGNR inhomogeneous structure, yields the\nthermoelectric figure of merit ZT~0.5 at room temperature and 0.5<ZT<2.5 below\nliquid nitrogen temperature.

An emission line luminosity in\na spectrum is a sum of a star formation component and an AGN component (if\npresent).

By comparing the\nobserved total line luminosity with that attributed to star formation, we can\ntell whether a galaxy host an AGN or not.

A unique feature of our method is its sensitivity: it is applicable to\n78% of the sample. We further make comparisons between our method and BPT using\nstacked spectra and selection in X-ray and radio wavelengths. We show that,\nwhile the method suffers from incompleteness and contamination as any AGN\nidentification methods do, it is overall a sensitive method to identify AGNs.\nAnother unique feature of the method is that it allows us to subtract emission\nline luminosity due to star formation and extract intrinsic AGN luminosity.

A series of experiments is reported\nusing two different software projects datasets namely, Tukutuku and COCOMO'81\ndatasets. The results are compared with those produced by the crisp version of\nthe ID3 decision tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2011 09:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-02"}

The algorithm is applicable in the\nwhole range of the retardation parameter. In the analysis of steady solutions,\nthere exists upper convergence limit of available numerical solutions in this\ncontraction flow that is free from the frustrating mesh dependence when we\nincorporate the tensor-logarithmic formulation [Fattal and Kupferman, JNNFM,\n2004]. With adjustment of a nonlinear parameter, 2 kinds of fluid have been\nchosen for flow modeling such as highly shear thinning and Boger-type liquids.\nAccording to the type of such property, the transient modeling has revealed\ndistinct flow dynamics of elastic instability. With pressure difference imposed\nslightly below the steady limit, the result demonstrates fluctuating solution\nwithout approaching steady state for the shear thinning fluid. From it, we\nconclude that the existence of upper limit for convergent steady solution\npossibly implies transition to spatially as well as temporally varying flow\nfield without steady asymptotic. Under the pressure fairly higher than the\nlimit, the result expresses severe fluctuation of flowrate, oscillation of\ncorner vortices and also asymmetric irregular wave propagation along the\ndownstream wall. In addition, flow dynamics seems quite stochastic with almost\nno temporal correlation. For the Boger-type fluid, under the traction higher\nthan steady limit the flowrate and corner vortices exhibit periodic oscillation\nwith flow asymmetry. Both types of instability express purely elastic\ninstability in this inertialess flow approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2011 10:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-02"}

The system admits both\nconvective instability and baroclinic instability. We find a smooth transition\nbetween the two types of modes, and investigate where the transition region\nbetween the two types of instability occurs in parameter space. The thermal\nwind helps to destabilise the convective modes. Baroclinic instability can\noccur when the applied vertical temperature gradient is stable, and the\ncritical Rayleigh number is then negative. Long wavelength modes are the first\nto become unstable. Asymptotic analysis is possible for the transition region\nand also for long wavelength instabilities, and the results agree well with our\nnumerical solutions. We also investigate how the instabilities in this system\nrelate to the classical baroclinic instability in the Eady problem. We conclude\nby noting that baroclinic instabilities in the Earth's core arising from\nheterogeneity in the lower mantle could possibly drive a dynamo even if the\nEarth's core were stably stratified and so not convecting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2011 12:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-02"}

We find that, in addition to a central bar,\nmultiple spiral patterns and lopsided modes develop in all models. Interaction\namong these asymmetric features results in a large scale stellar migration.\nHowever, we show that, despite the strong radial mixing, discs cannot be\nthickened sufficiently to match observed thick discs. We relate this to the\nadiabatic cooling as stars migrate radially outwards. We also find that the\nbulge contribution to a thick-disc component for an Sa-type galaxy at ~2.5 disc\nscale-lengths is less than 1% and zero in the case of a Milky Way-like,\nSb-type.

We were interested to define the set of minimal modifications\nthat are required to change the type of signal processing in the TGFb signaling\nnetwork. To define the key aspects for signaling plasticity we focused on the\ncore of the TGFb signaling network. With the help of a parameter screen we\nidentified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give\nrise to transient, sustained, or oscillatory responses to constant stimuli, as\nwell as those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to\ntime-varying ligand concentrations (as expected in the read-out of morphogens).\nA combination of a strong negative feedback and fast shuttling to the nucleus\nbiases signaling to a transient rather than a sustained response, while\noscillations were obtained if ligand binding to the receptor is weak and the\nturn-over of the I-Smad is fast. A proportional read-out required inefficient\nreceptor activation in addition to a low affinity of receptor-ligand binding.\nWe find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the\nresponse type. The architecture of the TGFb pathway enables the observed\nsignaling plasticity.

This\nraises the question: Is this really Hawking radiation, or some other form of\nquantum vacuum radiation? Naive estimates of the amount of quantum vacuum\nradiation generated due to the rapidly changing refractive index --- sometimes\ncalled the dynamical Casimir effect --- are not encouraging.

While the initial phases of radial contraction are\ndictated by drag forces and gravity, particle collisions become gradually more\nsignificant as filaments contract beyond Roche density. Here we present a new\nnumerical algorithm for treating momentum and energy exchange in collisions\nbetween numerical superparticles representing a high number of physical\nparticles. We adopt a Monte Carlo approach where superparticle pairs in a grid\ncell collide statistically on the physical collision time-scale. Collisions\noccur by enlarging particles until they touch and solving for the collision\noutcome, accounting for energy dissipation in inelastic collisions. We\ndemonstrate that superparticle collisions can be consistently implemented at a\nmodest computational cost. In protoplanetary disc turbulence driven by the\nstreaming instability, we argue that the relative Keplerian shear velocity\nshould be subtracted during the collision calculation.
