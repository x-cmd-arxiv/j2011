Previous research had led to the\nprediction that these packings were composed of a few known \"alloy\" phases\nincluding, for example, the AlB2 (hexagonal omega), HgBr2, and AuTe2\nstructures, and to XYn structures composed of close-packed large spheres with\nsmall spheres (in a number ratio of n to 1) in the interstices, e.g., the NaCl\npacking for n = 1. However, utilizing an implementation of the Torquato-Jiao\nsphere-packing algorithm [S. Torquato and Y. Jiao, Phys. Rev. E 82, 061302\n(2010)], we have discovered that many more structures appear in the densest\npackings. For example, while all previously known densest structures were\ncomposed of spheres in small to large number ratios of one to one, two to one,\nand very recently three to one, we have identified densest structures with\nnumber ratios of seven to three and five to two. In a recent work [A. B.\nHopkins, Y. Jiao, F. H. Stillinger, and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107,\n125501 (2011)], we summarized these findings. In this work, we present the\nstructures of the densest-known packings and provide details about their\ncharacteristics. Our findings demonstrate that a broad array of different\ndensest mechanically stable structures consisting of only two types of\ncomponents can form without any consideration of attractive or anisotropic\ninteractions. In addition, the novel structures that we have identified may\ncorrespond to currently unidentified stable phases of certain binary atomic and\nmolecular systems, particularly at high temperatures and pressures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 16:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 16:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this way, we argue that\nblack holes could have a different nature with respect the common belief. In\nfact, even remaining very compact astrophysics objects, they could be devoid of\nhorizons and singularities. Our analysis represents a key point within the\ndebate on the path to unification of theories. As recently some scientists\npartially retrieved the old Einstein's opinion that quantum mechanics has to be\nsubjected to a more general deterministic theory, a way to find solutions to\nthe problem of black hole horizons and singularities at a semi-classical level,\ni.e. without discussions of quantum gravity, becomes a fundamental framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 16:51:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 09:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 06:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 08:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-01"}

The maximally simplified case\nof zero magnetic shear is treated in the framework of a local shearing box.\nThere are no linearly growing eigenmodes, so all excitations are transient. The\nmaximal amplification factor of initial perturbations and the corresponding\nwavenumbers are calculated as functions of q/\\epsilon (=safety factor/aspect\nratio), temperature gradient and velocity shear.

For cases when turbulence is not\nsuppressed, an elementary heuristic theory of subcritical PVG turbulence\nleading to a scaling of the associated ion heat flux with q, \\epsilon, velocity\nshear and temperature gradient is proposed; it is argued that the transport is\nmuch less stiff than in the ITG regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 16:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

A fundamental technique that can be used to generate\nsamples from virtually any target probability distribution is the so-called\nrejection sampling method, which generates candidate samples from a proposal\ndistribution and then accepts them or not by testing the ratio of the target\nand proposal densities. The class of adaptive rejection sampling (ARS)\nalgorithms is particularly interesting because they can achieve high acceptance\nrates. However, the standard ARS method can only be used with log-concave\ntarget densities. For this reason, many generalizations have been proposed.\n  In this work, we investigate two different adaptive schemes that can be used\nto draw exactly from a large family of univariate probability density functions\n(pdf's), not necessarily log-concave, possibly multimodal and with tails of\narbitrary concavity. These techniques are adaptive in the sense that every time\na candidate sample is rejected, the acceptance rate is improved. The two\nproposed algorithms can work properly when the target pdf is multimodal, with\nfirst and second derivatives analytically intractable, and when the tails are\nlog-convex in a infinite domain. Therefore, they can be applied in a number of\nscenarios in which the other generalizations of the standard ARS fail.

While widely used in population\nbiology, genetics and ecology, statistical inference of the instantaneous\nparticle birth and death rates remains largely limited to restrictive linear\nBDPs in which per-particle birth and death rates are constant. Researchers\noften observe the number of particles at discrete times, necessitating data\naugmentation procedures such as expectation-maximization (EM) to find maximum\nlikelihood estimates. The E-step in the EM algorithm is available in\nclosed-form for some linear BDPs, but otherwise previous work has resorted to\napproximation or simulation. Remarkably, the E-step conditional expectations\ncan also be expressed as convolutions of computable transition probabilities\nfor any general BDP with arbitrary rates. This important observation, along\nwith a convenient continued fraction representation of the Laplace transforms\nof the transition probabilities, allows novel and efficient computation of the\nconditional expectations for all BDPs, eliminating the need for approximation\nor costly simulation. We use this insight to derive EM algorithms that yield\nmaximum likelihood estimation for general BDPs characterized by various rate\nmodels, including generalized linear models. We show that our Laplace\nconvolution technique outperforms competing methods when available and\ndemonstrate a technique to accelerate EM algorithm convergence.

These series of flares may be\nassociated with cyclic activity of the protostellar object in UH II. In the\nremaining time intervals, there were mainly short-lived flares of single\nfeatures. The Stokes parameters for the observations in the hydroxyl lines were\ndetermined. Zeeman splitting was observed in the profile of the 1667 MHz OH\nmain line at a velocity of 58.5 km/s, and was used estimate the intensity of\nthe line-of-sight component of the magnetic field (1.2 mG).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 18:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-22"}

Nevertheless, interference may be introduced\nto the Primary User (PU) when the Secondary Users (SUs) dynamically utilize the\nPU's licensed channels. If the SUs can be synchronous with the PU's time slots,\nthe interference is mainly due to their imperfect spectrum sensing of the\nprimary channel. However, if the SUs have no knowledge about the PU's exact\ncommunication mechanism, additional interference may occur. In this paper, we\npropose a dynamic spectrum access protocol for the SUs confronting with unknown\nprimary behavior and study the interference caused by their dynamic access.\nThrough analyzing the SUs' dynamic behavior in the primary channel which is\nmodeled as an ON-OFF process, we prove that the SUs' communication behavior is\na renewal process. Based on the Renewal Theory, we quantify the interference\ncaused by the SUs and derive the corresponding close-form expressions. With the\ninterference analysis, we study how to optimize the SUs' performance under the\nconstraints of the PU's communication quality of service (QoS) and the\nsecondary network's stability.

In\nprinciple, one wants to have such a matrix with minimum possible number $M$ of\nrows (tests). One of the main ways of constructing disjunct matrices relies on\n\\emph{constant weight error-correcting codes} and their \\emph{minimum\ndistance}. In this paper, we consider a relaxed definition of a disjunct matrix\nknown as \\emph{almost disjunct matrix}.

The relaxed\ndefinition allows one to come up with group testing schemes where a\nclose-to-one fraction of all possible sets of defective items are identifiable.\nOur main contribution is twofold. First, we go beyond the minimum distance\nanalysis and connect the \\emph{average distance} of a constant weight code to\nthe parameters of an almost disjunct matrix constructed from it. Our second\ncontribution is to explicitly construct almost disjunct matrices based on our\naverage distance analysis, that have much smaller number of rows than any\nprevious explicit construction of disjunct matrices.

In solids, the rigid structure of the material sets the mass and\nvelocity of the particles, as well as their interactions. A different, highly\nflexible approach is to create model systems using fermionic atoms trapped in\nthe periodic potential of interfering laser beams, a method which so far has\nonly been applied to explore simple lattice structures [3, 4]. Here we report\non the creation of Dirac points with adjustable properties in a tunable\nhoneycomb optical lattice.

The cold-mode gas is mostly\nconfined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium\nwith the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas\ntypically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling.\nHowever, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given\nmode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong\nstatements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong\ncooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas\naccreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback\nresults in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii.\nThe gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also\naccount for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass.

We show that in most respects, it would appear\nto us as quantum. The statistical theory of classical mechanics, which\nspecifies how probability distributions over phase space evolve under\nHamiltonian evolution and under measurements, is typically called Liouville\nmechanics, so the theory we explore here is Liouville mechanics with an\nepistemic restriction. The particular epistemic restriction we posit as our\nfoundational postulate specifies two constraints. The first constraint is a\nclassical analogue of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle -- the second-order\nmoments of position and momentum defined by the phase-space distribution that\ncharacterizes an agent's knowledge are required to satisfy the same constraints\nas are satisfied by the moments of position and momentum observables for a\nquantum state. The second constraint is that the distribution should have\nmaximal entropy for the given moments. Starting from this postulate, we derive\nthe allowed preparations, measurements and transformations and demonstrate that\nthey are isomorphic to those allowed in Gaussian quantum mechanics and generate\nthe same experimental statistics. We argue that this reconstruction of Gaussian\nquantum mechanics constitutes additional evidence in favour of a research\nprogram wherein quantum states are interpreted as states of incomplete\nknowledge, and that the phenomena that do not arise in Gaussian quantum\nmechanics provide the best clues for how one might reconstruct the full quantum\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 23:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 23:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-12"}

This is done by allowing a more\ngeneral form for the mass term, while leaving the kinetic terms untouched. We\nfind that the interaction is consistent and does not lead to superluminal\npropagation for a range of the mass of the spin 1/2 particle, except for the\nspecial point where the spin 1/2 particle is infinitely massive. We then\nquantize the theory using the appropriate Grassmann-variable path integral and\nstudy the poles of the propagator. The unfamiliar feature of the theory is that\nthe charge matrix is not positive definite; it is positive definite on the\nspace of spin 3/2 solutions, and negative definite on the space of spin 1/2\nsolutions. Classically, for spin 1/2 modes the energy is of the opposite sign\nto frequency, i.e. the positive frequency modes have negative energy. It is\nfound that the retarded part appropriately propagates the positive energy\nsolutions forward in time, while the advanced part propagates the negative\nenergy solutions back in time so long as the free parameter is chosen such that\nthe positive frequency modes have the same parity. The propagator contains\npoles of the spin 1/2 modes above the real axis for the positive and below the\nreal axis for the negative frequency modes, while the residues at those poles\nare also of the sign opposite to the usual; altogether this leads to a unitary\nS-matrix, the forward amplitude <p|p> being positive for all modes. The\ncanonically quantized field is causal, and the equal-time anti-commutator has\npositive definite form.

This selfish behavior is\ndifficult to distinguish, making existing detection based incentive schemes\nfail to work. To thwart entropy selfishness in distributed collaborative\nsensing, we propose YouSense, a One-Time Pad (OTP) based incentive design that\ncould naturally isolate entropy selfish users from the honest users without\nselfish node detection. The basic idea of YouSense is to construct a trapdoor\none-time pad for each sensing report by combining the original report and a\nrandom key. Such a one-time pad based encryption could prevent entropy selfish\nusers from accessing the original sensing report while enabling the honest\nusers to recover the report. Different from traditional cryptography based OTP\nwhich requires the key delivery, YouSense allows an honest user to recover the\npad (or key) by exploiting a unique characteristic of collaborative sensing\nthat different secondary users share some common observations on the same radio\nspectrum. We further extend YouSense to improve the recovery successful rate by\nreducing the cardinality of set of the possible pads.

Our work, which constitutes an extension of Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 106}, 095702 (2011), shows that the method provides an accurate\ndescription of the equilibrium zero temperature phase diagram of the\nBose-Hubbard model for several lattices in two- and three-dimensions (2D and\n3D). We show that the accuracy of this method increases with the coordination\nnumber $z_0$ of the lattice and reaches to within 0.5% of quantum Monte Carlo\ndata for lattices with $z_0=6$. We compute the excitation spectra of the bosons\nusing this method in the Mott and the superfluid phases and compare our results\nwith mean-field theory. We also show that the same method may be used to\nanalyze the non-equilibrium dynamics of the model both in the Mott phase and\nnear the superfluid-insulator quantum critical point where the hopping\namplitude $J$ and the on-site interaction $U$ satisfy $z_0J/U \\ll 1$. In\nparticular, we study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the model both subsequent\nto a sudden quench of the hopping amplitude $J$ and during a ramp from $J_i$ to\n$J_f$ characterized by a ramp time $\\tau$ and exponent $\\alpha$: $J(t)=J_i\n+(J_f-J_i) (t/\\tau)^{\\alpha}$. We compute the wavefunction overlap $F$, the\nresidual energy $Q$, the superfluid order parameter $\\Delta(t)$, the equal-time\norder parameter correlation function $C(t)$, and the defect formation\nprobability $P$ for the above-mentioned protocols and provide a comparison of\nour results to their mean-field counterparts. We find that $Q$, $F$, and $P$ do\nnot exhibit the expected universal scaling. We explain this absence of\nuniversality and show that our results for linear ramps compare well with the\nrecent experimental observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 04:30:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 14:18:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 06:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

A simplified molecular device approach was developed by avoiding\nthe need of depositing a new materiel on the bottom electrode for growing\nultrathin insulator. This paper discuss the approach for MEMED's insulator\ngrowth by one-step oxidation of a tantalum (Ta) bottom electrode, in the\npholithographically defined region; i.e. ultrathin tantalum oxide (TaOx)\ninsulator was grown by oxidizing bottom metal electrode itself.

Most of the individual\nspectra are drawn from our ongoing survey in the GOODS fields with the Keck\nDEIMOS spectrograph, and we have augmented our sample with published data taken\nwith FORS2 on the VLT. In general we find similar trends in the spectral\ndiagnostics to those found in the earlier, more extensive survey of LBGs at z=3\nundertaken by Shapley et al (2003). Specifically, we find low-ionization\nabsorption lines which trace the presence of neutral outflowing gas are weaker\nin galaxies with stronger Lyman-alpha emission, bluer UV spectral slopes, lower\nstellar masses, lower UV luminosities and smaller half-light radii. This is\nconsistent with a physical picture whereby star formation drives outflows of\nneutral gas which scatters Lyman-alpha and gives rise to strong low-ionization\nabsorption lines, while increasing the stellar mass, size, metallicity, and\ndust content of galaxies. Typical galaxies are thus expected to have stronger\nLyman-alpha emission and weaker low-ionization absorption at earlier times\n(higher redshifts). Indeed, our mean spectrum at z=4 shows somewhat weaker\nlow-ionization absorption lines than at z=3 and available data at higher\nredshift indicates a rapid decrease in low-ionization absorption strength with\nredshift. We argue that the reduced low-ionization absorption is likely caused\nby a decrease in the covering fraction and/or velocity range of outflowing\nneutral gas at earlier epochs. Our continuing survey will enable us to extend\nthese diagnostics more reliably to higher redshift and determine the\nimplications for the escape fraction of ionizing photons which governs the role\nof early galaxies in cosmic reionization.

IAMs arise in a variety of image\nprocessing and computer vision applications, where they provide a natural\nlow-dimensional embedding of the collection of high-dimensional images. To date\nIAMs have been studied as embedded submanifolds of Euclidean spaces.\nUnfortunately, their promise has not been realized in practice, because real\nworld imagery typically contains sharp edges that render an IAM\nnon-differentiable and hence non-isometric to the low-dimensional parameter\nspace under the Euclidean metric. As a result, the standard tools from\ndifferential geometry, in particular using linear tangent spaces to transport\nalong the IAM, have limited utility. In this paper, we explore a nonlinear\ntransport operator for IAMs based on the optical flow between images and\ndevelop new analytical tools reminiscent of those from differential geometry\nusing the idea of optical flow manifolds (OFMs). We define a new metric for\nIAMs that satisfies certain local isometry conditions, and we show how to use\nthis metric to develop a new tools such as flow fields on IAMs, parallel flow\nfields, parallel transport, as well as a intuitive notion of curvature. The\nspace of optical flow fields along a path of constant curvature has a natural\nmulti-scale structure via a monoid structure on the space of all flow fields\nalong a path. We also develop lower bounds on approximation errors while\napproximating non-parallel flow fields by parallel flow fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 05:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

We also obtain a phase-squeezing\ncriterion that is immune to number fluctuations using similar techniques. These\nare utilized to obtain an operational definition of relative phase-measurement\nsensitivity, via analysis of phase measurement in interferometry. We show that\nthese measures are proportional to enhanced phase-measurement sensitivity. The\nphase-entanglement criterion is a hallmark for a new type of quantum squeezing,\nnamely planar quantum squeezing. This has the property that it squeezes two\northogonal spin directions simultaneously, which is possible owing to the fact\nthat the SU(2) group that describes spin symmetry has a three-dimensional\nparameter space, of higher dimension than the group for photonic quadratures.\nThe practical advantage of planar quantum squeezing is that, unlike\nconventional spin-squeezing, it allows noise reduction over all phase-angles\nsimultaneously. The application of this type of squeezing is to quantum\nmeasure- ment of an unknown phase. We show that a completely unknown phase\nrequires two orthogonal measurements, and that with planar quantum squeezing it\nis possible to reduce the measurement uncertainty independently of the unknown\nphase value. This is a different type of squeezing to the usual spin-squeezing\ninterferometric criterion, which is only applicable when the measured phase is\nalready known to a good approximation, or can be measured iteratively. As an\nexample, we calcu- late the phase-entanglement of the ground state of a\ntwo-well, coupled Bose-Einstein condensate, similar to recent experiments.

In the first\npart of the thesis the classical theory is investigated with a particular focus\non the infinite dimensional character of the underlying structures. It is shown\nthat the use of infinite dimensional differential geometry allows for a\nconceptually clear and elegant formulation. The construction of the BV complex\nis performed in a fully covariant way and we also generalize the BV framework\nto a more abstract level, using functors and natural transformations. In this\nsetting we construct the BV complex for classical gravity. This allows us to\ngive a homological interpretation to the notion of diffeomorphism invariant\nphysical quantities in general relativity.\n  The second part of the thesis concerns the quantum theory. We provide a\nframework for the BV quantization that doesn't rely on the path integral\nformalism, but is completely formulated within perturbative algebraic quantum\nfield theory. To make such a formulation possible we first prove that the\nrenormalized time-ordered product can be understood as a binary operation on a\nsuitable domain. Using this result we prove the associativity of this product\nand provide a consistent framework for the renormalized BV structures. In\nparticular the renormalized quantum master equation and the renormalized\nquantum BV operator are defined. To give a precise meaning to theses objects we\nmake a use of the master Ward identity, which is an important structure in\ncausal perturbation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 09:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 23:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-21"}

This level\nof abstraction is often reasonable, hiding implementation details from users\nwho may want to specify the system's global behaviour in terms of an LTL\nformula. However, the problem that arises then is how such a specification can\nactually be monitored in a distributed system that has no central data\ncollection point, where all the components' local behaviours are observable. In\nthis case, the LTL specification needs to be decomposed into sub-formulae\nwhich, in turn, need to be distributed amongst the components' locally attached\nmonitors, each of which sees only a distinct part of the global behaviour. The\nmain contribution of this paper is an algorithm for distributing and monitoring\nLTL formulae, such that satisfac- tion or violation of specifications can be\ndetected by local monitors alone. We present an implementation and show that\nour algorithm introduces only a minimum delay in detecting\nsatisfaction/violation of a specification.

The temperature dependent powder x ray studies reveal no structural phase\ntransition in the temperature range 10 -- 300 K.

The\nradial temperature profile is flatter than the average profile for other\nclusters until the radius reaches the northwest radio relic. The temperature\ndrops sharply from 5 keV to about 2 keV at the northwest radio relic region.\nThe sharp changes of the temperature can be interpreted as a shock with a Mach\nnumber of about 2.5. The entropy slope becomes flatter in the outer region and\nnegative around the radio relic region. In this region, the relaxation\ntimescale of electron-ion Coulomb collisions is longer than the time elapsed\nafter the shock heating and the plasma may be out of equilibrium. Using\ndifferential emission measure (DEM) models, we also confirm the\nmulti-temperature structure around the radio relic region, characterized by two\npeaks at 1 keV and 4 keV. These features suggest that the gas is heated by a\nshock propagating from the center to outer region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 11:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In constructive ZF (CZF)\nthe existence of enough projective sets has been discussed as an additional\naxiom taken from the interpretation of CZF in Martin-Loef's intuitionistic type\ntheory. On the other hand, every non-empty set is injective in classical ZF,\nwhich argument fails to work in CZF. The aim of this paper is to shed some\nlight on the problem whether there are (enough) injective sets in CZF.\n  We show that no two element set is injective unless the law of excluded\nmiddle is admitted for negated formulas, and that the axiom of power set is\nrequired for proving that there are strongly enough injective sets. The latter\nnotion is abstracted from the singleton embedding into the power set, which\nensures enough injectives both in every topos and in IZF. We further show that\nit is consistent with CZF to assume that the only injective sets are the\nsingletons. In particular, assuming the consistency of CZF one cannot prove in\nCZF that there are enough injective sets.

Current approaches do this by making use of\nadaptive media playout (AMP) to reduce the playout rate. However, this\nintroduces playout distortion to the viewers and increases the viewing latency.\nWe approach this by proposing a frame rate optimization framework that adjusts\nboth the encoder frame generation rate and the decoder playout frame rate.\nFirstly, we model this problem as the joint adjustment of the encoder frame\ngeneration interval and the decoder playout frame interval. This model is used\nwith a discontinuity penalty virtual buffer to track the accumulated difference\nbetween the receiving frame interval and the playout frame interval. We then\napply Lyapunov optimization to the model to systematically derive a pair of\ndecoupled optimization policies. We show that the occupancy of the\ndiscontinuity penalty virtual buffer is correlated to the video discontinuity\nand that this framework produces a very low playout distortion in addition to a\nsignificant reduction in the prebuffering requirements compared to existing\napproaches. Secondly, we introduced a delay constraint into the framework by\nusing a delay accumulator virtual buffer. Simulation results show that the the\ndelay constrained framework provides a superior tradeoff between the video\nquality and the delay introduced compared to the existing approach. Finally, we\nanalyzed the impact of delayed feedback between the receiver and the sender on\nthe optimization policies. We show that the delayed feedbacks have a minimal\nimpact on the optimization policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 13:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

The effective\napproach is especially well geared for addressing the concept of relational\nevolution in this context, since it enables one to switch between different\nclocks and yields a consistent (temporally) local time evolution with transient\nobservables so long as semiclassicality holds. We provide evidence that\nrelational evolution in this model universe, while possible for sufficiently\nsemiclassical states, generically breaks down in the region of maximal\nexpansion. This is rooted in a defocusing of classical trajectories, which\nleads to a rapid spreading of states that are initially sharply peaked and to a\nmixing of internal time directions in this region.

This was\nfollowed by a slow rise, accelerating to reach and overtake the first (1978)\nphotometry, demonstrating that the outburst observed in 1978--79 was not an\nisolated event, but that they recur at intervals of 32+ years.

To meet these goals, the energy resolution of the\ncalorimeter must be better than 1.5% at high energies. LumiCal has been\ndesigned as a 30-layer sampling calorimeter with tungsten as the passive\nmaterial and silicon as the active material. Monte Carlo simulation using the\nGeant4 software framework has been used to identify design elements which\nadversely impact energy resolution and correct for them without loss of\nstatistics. BeamCal, covering polar angles smaller than LumiCal, will serve for\nbeam tuning, luminosity optimisation and high energy electron detection.\nSecondly, prototypes of the sensors and electronics for both detectors have\nbeen evaluated during beam tests, the results of which are also presented here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 13:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

The primary global wave has a three-dimensional dome shape, with\npropagation speeds ranging from 430-780 km/s in different directions. The\nprimary coronal wave runs in front of the expanding loops involved in the CME\nand its propagation speeds are approximately constant within 10-20 minutes.\nUpon arrival at an AR on its path, the primary EUV wave apparently disappears\nand a secondary wave rapidly reemerges 75 Mm within the AR boundary at a\nsimilar speed. When the EUV wave encounters a coronal bright structure, an\nadditional wave front appears there and propagates in front of it at a velocity\nnearly a factor of 2 faster. Reflected waves from a polar CH and a coronal\nbright structure are observed and propagate fractionally slower than the\nprimary waves. Some of these phenomena can be equally explained by either a\nwave or non-wave model alone. However, taken together, these observations\nprovide new evidence for the multitudes of global EUV waves, in which a true\nMHD fast-mode wave or shock propagates in front of an expanding CME bubble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 14:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The field\nis currently undergoing major revisions with the recognition of several key\nprocesses as new critical ingredients. Stochastic effects can artificially\nenhance or suppress certain evolutionary phases and/or stellar mass regimes and\nintroduce systematic biases in, e.g., the determination of the stellar initial\nmass function. Post-main-sequence evolution is often associated with irregular\nvariations of stellar properties on ultra-short time-scales.

We carry out a detailed 2D study of the ionised gas in the local\nuniverse galaxy UGC9837. In nearby galaxies, like the galaxy in question here,\nthe spatial distribution of the physical properties can be studied in detail,\nproviding benchmarks for galaxy formation models.\n  Aims. Our aim is to derive detailed and spatially resolved physical\nproperties of the ionised gas of UGC 9837. In addition, we derive an integrated\nspectrum of the galaxy and study how varying spatial coverage affects the\nderived integrated properties. We also study how the same properties would be\nseen if the galaxy was placed at a higher redshift and observed as part of one\nof the high-z surveys.\n  Methods. UGC9837 was observed using the PMAS PPAK integral field unit. The\nspectra are reduced and calibrated and the stellar and ionised components\nseparated. Using strong emission line ratios of the ionised gas, the source of\nionisation, the dust extinction, the star formation rate, the electron density\nand the oxygen abundance derived from a total integrated spectrum, central\nintegrated spectrum and individual fibre spectra are studied. Finally, the same\nproperties are studied in a spectrum whose spatial resolution is degraded to\nsimulate high-z observations.\n  Results. The spatial distribution of the ionised gas properties is consistent\nwith inside-out growing scenario of galaxies. We also find that lack of spatial\ncoverage would bias the results derived from the integrated spectrum leading,\ne.g., to an under-estimation of ionisation and over-estimation of metallicity,\nif only the centre of the galaxy was covered by the spectrum. Our simulation of\nhigh-z observations shows that part of the spatial information, such as dust\nand SFR distribution would be lost while shallower gradients in metallicity and\nionisation strength would be detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 14:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Moreover, conditions\nof ecological survival, imposed on such systems, lead to a discrimination\nbetween \"self\" and \"non-self\" as well as to the emergence of different\nself-phenomena.

One field samples the major axis populations--the Outer\nDisc field--while the other is offset by ~18' and samples the Warp in the\nstellar disc. The CMDs based on HST/ACS imaging reach old main-sequence\nturn-offs (~12.5 Gyr). We apply the CMD-fitting technique to the Warp field to\nreconstruct the star formation history (SFH). We find that after undergoing\nroughly constant SF until about 4.5 Gyr ago, there was a rapid decline in\nactivity and then a ~1.5 Gyr lull, followed by a strong burst lasting 1.5 Gyr\nand responsible for 25% of the total stellar mass in this field. This burst\nappears to be accompanied by a decline in metallicity which could be a\nsignature of the inflow of metal-poor gas. The onset of the burst (~3 Gyr ago)\ncorresponds to the last close passage of M31 and M33 as predicted by detailed\nN-body modelling, and may have been triggered by this event. We reprocess the\ndeep M33 outer disc field data of Barker et al. (2011) in order to compare\nconsistently-derived SFHs. This reveals a similar duration burst that is\nexactly coeval with that seen in the M31 Warp field, lending further support to\nthe interaction hypothesis. The complex SFHs and the smoothly-varying\nage-metallicity relations suggest that the stellar populations observed in the\nfar outer discs of both galaxies have largely formed in situ rather than\nmigrated from smaller galactocentric radii. The strong differential reddening\naffecting the CMD of the Outer Disc field prevents derivation of the SFH.\nInstead, we quantify this reddening and find that the fine-scale distribution\nof dust precisely follows that of the HI gas. This indicates that the outer HI\ndisc of M31 contains a substantial amount of dust and therefore suggests\nsignificant metal enrichment in these parts, consistent with inferences from\nour CMD analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 15:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
