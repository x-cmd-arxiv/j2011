The method is based on the introduction\nof an 'effective temperature' function that varies with time. First we\nintroduce a non-stationary vacuum state for a quantum scalar field, which\ninterpolates between the Boulware vacuum state at early times and the Unruh\nvacuum state at late times. In this way we mimic the process of switching on\nHawking radiation in realistic collapse scenarios. Then, we analyse this vacuum\nstate from the perspective of static observers at different radial positions,\nobservers undergoing a free-fall trajectory from infinity and observers\nstanding at rest at a radial distance and then released to fall freely towards\nthe horizon. The physical image that emerges from these analyses is rather rich\nand compelling. Among many other results, we find that generic freely-falling\nobservers do not perceive vacuum when crossing the horizon, but an effective\ntemperature a few times larger than the one that they perceived when it started\nto free-fall. We explain this phenomenon as due to a diverging Doppler effect\nat horizon crossing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2011 16:22:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 07:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The survey spans 5.3 < z_abs < 6.4 and has a\npathlength interval \\Delta X=39.5, or \\Delta z=8.0. In total we detect ten\nsystems, five of which are new discoveries. The line-of-sight number density is\nconsistent with the combined number density at z~3 of DLAs and sub-DLAs, which\ncomprise the main population of low-ionization systems at lower redshifts. This\napparent lack of evolution may occur because low ionization systems are hosted\nby lower-mass halos at higher redshifts, or because the mean cross section of\nlow-ionization gas at a given halo mass increases with redshift due to the\nhigher densities and lower ionizing background. The roughly constant number\ndensity notably contrasts with the sharp decline at z > 5.3 in the number\ndensity of highly-ionized systems traced by C IV. The low-ionization systems at\nz~6 span a similar range of velocity widths as lower-redshift sub-DLAs but have\nsignificantly weaker lines at a given width. This implies that the\nmass-metallicity relation of the host galaxies evolves towards lower\nmetallicities at higher redshifts.

Of course this\napproach can only be applied whenever there is a newtonian limit, and the\nlatter is related to the GR solution that is generalized by a given ST solution\nunder consideration. This procedure thus assumes two hypothesis: On the one\nhand, that there should be a weak field limit of the GR solution; On the other\nhand that the latter corresponds to the limit case of given ST solution. In the\npresent work we consider a ST solution with negative spatial curvature. It\ngeneralizes a general relativistic solution known as being of a degenerate\nclass (A) for its unusual properties. In particular, the GR solution does not\nexhibit the usual weak field limit in the region where the gravitational field\nis static. The absence of a weak field limit for the hyperbolic GR solution\nmeans that such limit is also absent for comparison with the ST solution, and\nthus one cannot barely apply the PPN formalism. We therefore analyse the\nproperties of the hyperbolic ST solution, and discuss the question o defining a\ngeneralised newtonian limit both for the GR solution and for the purpose of\ncontrasting it with the ST solution.

In this discourse, the attention is focused on extrapolating\nthe mass of the rho meson to the physical pion mass in quenched QCD (QQCD).\nWith the absence of a known experimental value, this serves to demonstrate the\nability of the extrapolation scheme to make predictions without prior bias. By\nusing extended effective field theory developed previously, an extrapolation is\nperformed using quenched lattice QCD data that extends outside the chiral\npower-counting regime (PCR). The method involves an analysis of the\nrenormalization flow curves of the low energy coefficients in a finite-range\nregularized effective field theory. The analysis identifies an optimal\nregulator, which is embedded in the lattice QCD data themselves. This optimal\nregulator is the regulator value at which the renormalization of the low energy\ncoefficients is approximately independent of the range of quark masses\nconsidered. By using recent precision, quenched lattice results, the\nextrapolation is tested directly by truncating the analysis to a set of points\nabove 380 MeV, while being blinded of the results probing deeply into the\nchiral regime.

We show that very limited\nassumptions about x allow one to make successful predictions about unseen bits\nof x. First, we study the problem of successfully predicting a single 0 from\namong the bits of x. In our model we have only one chance to make a prediction,\nbut may do so at a time of our choosing. We describe and motivate this as the\nproblem of a frog who wants to cross a road safely.\n  Letting N_t denote the number of 1s among the first t bits of x, we say that\nx is \"eps-weakly sparse\" if lim inf (N_t/t) <= eps. Our main result is a\nrandomized algorithm that, given any eps-weakly sparse sequence x, predicts a 0\nof x with success probability as close as desired to 1 - \\eps. Thus we can\nperform this task with essentially the same success probability as under the\nmuch stronger assumption that each bit of x takes the value 1 independently\nwith probability eps. We apply this result to show how to successfully predict\na bit (0 or 1) under a broad class of possible assumptions on the sequence x.\nThe assumptions are stated in terms of the behavior of a finite automaton M\nreading the bits of x.\n  We also propose and solve a variant of the well-studied \"ignorant\nforecasting\" problem.

IRAS\n15099-5856 has a complex morphology with a bright central compact source (IRS1)\nsurrounded by knots, spurs, and several extended (~4') arc-like filaments. The\nsource is seen only at >= 10 um. The Spitzer MIR spectrum of IRS1 shows\nprominent emission features from Mg-rich crystalline silicates, strong [Ne II]\n12.81 um and several other faint ionic lines.

Molecular\nline observations reveal two molecular clouds around the source, but no\nassociated dense molecular cores.

As AERA performs \"radio-hybrid\" measurements of air\nshower radio emission in coincidence with the surface particle detectors and\nfluorescence telescopes of the Pierre Auger Observatory, the radio analysis\nfunctionality had to be incorporated in the existing hybrid analysis solutions\nfor fluoresence and surface detector data. This goal has been achieved in a\nnatural way by extending the existing Auger Offline software framework with\nradio functionality.

Arranging the chemical elements in an increasing atomic number\norder, a symmetry pattern known as the Periodic Table is detectable. The\ncorrelation between nuclear charge and the Periodic System of the Chemical\nElements (PSCE) indicates that the symmetry emerges from the nucleus. Nuclear\nsymmetry can only exist if the relative positions of the nucleons in the\nnucleus are invariant. Pauli exclusion principle can also be interpreted as the\nnucleons should occupy a lattice position. Based on symmetry and other\nindicatives face centered cubic arrangement have been proposed for the nuclear\nlattice. A lattice model, representing the protons and the neutrons by equal\nspheres and arranging them alternately in a face centered cubic structure\nforming a double tetrahedron, is able to reproduce all of the properties of the\nnucleus including the quantum numbers and the periodicity of the elements.\nBased on the geometry of the nuclear structure it is shown that when a new\n'layer' of the nuclear structure starts then the distance between the first\nproton in the new layer and the charge center of the nucleus is smaller than\nthe distance of the proton, which completed the preceding 'layer'. Thus a new\nvalence electron shell should start to develop when the nuclear structure is\nexpanded. The expansion of the double tetrahedron FCC nuclear lattice model\noffers a feasible physical explanation how the nucleus affects the electronic\nconfiguration of the chemical elements depicted by the periodic table.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 09:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 19:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

We apply this technique on several well-studied\nproblems: Feedback Arc Set in (Bipartite) Tournaments, Dense Rooted Triplet\nInconsistency and Betweenness in Tournaments. For the former, one is given a\n(bipartite) tournament $T = (V,A)$ and seeks a set of at most $k$ arcs whose\nreversal in $T$ results in an acyclic (bipartite) tournament. While a linear\nvertex-kernel is already known for the first problem, using the Conflict\nPacking allows us to find a so-called safe partition, the central tool of the\nkernelization algorithm in, with simpler arguments. For the case of bipartite\ntournaments, the same technique allows us to obtain a quadratic vertex-kernel.\nAgain, such a kernel was already known to exist, using the concept of so-called\nbimodules. We believe however that providing an unifying technique to cope with\nsuch problems is interesting. Regarding Dense Rooted Triplet Inconsistency, one\nis given a set of vertices $V$ and a dense collection $\\mathcal{R}$ of rooted\nbinary trees over three vertices of $V$ and seeks a rooted tree over $V$\ncontaining all but at most $k$ triplets from $\\mathcal{R}$. As a main\nconsequence of our technique, we prove that the Dense Rooted Triplet\nInconsistency problem admits a linear vertex-kernel. This result improves the\nbest known bound of $O(k^2)$ vertices for this problem. Finally, we use this\ntechnique to obtain a linear vertex-kernel for Betweenness in Tournaments,\nwhere one is given a set of vertices $V$ and a dense collection $\\mathcal{R}$\nof so-called betweenness triplets and seeks a linear ordering of the vertices\ncontaining all but at most $k$ triplets from $\\mathcal{R}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 10:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 15:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 06:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

Now two neutrino double\nbeta decay has been recorded for 10 nuclei ($^{48}$Ca, $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se,\n$^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, $^{128}$Te, $^{130}$Te, $^{150}$Nd,\n$^{238}$U).

The physical\nimplications of this abundance of symmetry remain unclear. In recent work, it\nhas been shown how these chiral symmetries for overlap fermions can be derived\nfrom a renormalisation group blocking in the continuum, transforming the action\nfrom the standard continuum action to an equivalent to the lattice overlap\naction. There is no unique blocking, and different blockings lead to different\nchiral symmetries. The group of symmetries found by Mandula immediately\nfollows. In this way, the excess chiral symmetry on the lattice can be\nexplained in terms of different renormalisation schemes.\n  The previous work suffered from one technical challenge: there is no\ncontinuum analogue of the lattice chiral eigenvectors at eigenvalue $2/a$. As\nthe construction of the overlap operator required a mapping between lattice and\ncontinuum eigenvalues, the lack of a continuum counterpart to the doublers of\nthe zero modes creates an ambiguity in the construction. Although the lattice\nchiral symmetry can still be defined, this leads to difficulties when\nconsidering $\\mathcal{CP}$ symmetry on the lattice. In this work, we\ninvestigate the possibility of resolving this ambiguity by adding a second\nfermion field to the original continuum action used as a basis of the\nrenormalisation group blockings. This second fermion field has a mass of the\norder of the momentum cut-off, to simulate the effects of the fermion doublers.\nWorking through the same renormalisation group procedure to map this action to\nthe lattice overlap action yields additional Ginsparg-Wilson relations\nsatisfied by the overlap operator, and more (non-commuting) lattice chiral\nsymmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 13:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-25"}

We chose as a test case, the\n19 May 2007 CME observed by STEREO and ACE. The spheromak is an appealing\nphysical model, because the location and degree of heating is fixed by the\nchoice of anomalous resistivity and the spheromak expansion rate which we\nconstrain with observations. This model can provide the heating required\nbetween 1.1$R_{\\sun}$ and earth orbit to produce charge states observed in the\nCME flux rope. However this source of heating in the spheromak alone has\ndifficulty accounting for the rapid heating to Fe$^{8 - 11+}$ at lower heights,\nas observed in STEREO EUVI due to the rapid radiative cooling that occurs at\nthe high densities involved. Episodes of heating and cooling clearly unrelated\nto spheromak expansion are observed prior to the eruption, and presumably still\nplay a role during the eruption itself. Spheromak heating is also not capable\nof reproducing the high Fe charge states (Fe$^{16+}$ and higher) seen in situ\nexterior to the flux rope in this CME. Thus while the spheromak configuration\nmay be a valid model for the magnetic topology, other means of energization are\nstill required to provide much of the rapid heating observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 15:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}

We study here the steady-state entropy\nproduction, both at short times as well as in the long-time limit, of two\nimportant classes of non-equilibrium systems: transport systems and\nreaction-diffusion systems. The usefulness of the mean entropy production rate\nand of the large deviation function of the entropy production for\ncharacterizing non-equilibrium steady states of interacting many-body systems\nis discussed. We show that the large deviation function displays a kink-like\nfeature at zero entropy production that is similar to that observed for a\nsingle particle driven along a periodic potential. This kink is a direct\nconsequence of the detailed fluctuation theorem fulfilled by the probability\ndistribution of the entropy production and is therefore a generic feature of\nthe corresponding large deviation function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 15:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

As a test and first application of this model atom, Fe abundances\nare determined for the Sun and five stars with well determined stellar\nparameters and high-quality observed spectra. Non-LTE leads to systematically\ndepleted total absorption in the Fe I lines and to positive abundance\ncorrections in agreement with the previous studies, however, the magnitude of\nnon-LTE effect is smaller compared to the earlier results. Non-LTE corrections\ndo not exceed 0.1 dex for the solar metallicity and mildly metal-deficient\nstars, and they vary within 0.21 dex and 0.35 dex in the very metal-poor stars\nHD 84937 and HD 122563, respectively, depending on the assumed efficiency of\ncollisions with hydrogen atoms. Based on the analysis of the Fe I/Fe II\nionization equilibrium in these two stars, we recommend to apply the Drawin\nformalism in non-LTE studies of Fe with a scaling factor of 0.1. For the Fe II\nlines, non-LTE corrections do not exceed 0.01 dex in absolute value. The solar\nnon-LTE abundance obtained from 54 Fe I lines is 7.56+-0.09 and the abundance\nfrom 18 Fe II lines varies between 7.41+-0.11 and 7.56+-0.05 depending on the\nsource of the gf-values. Thus, gf-values available for the iron lines are not\naccurate enough to pursue high-accuracy absolute abundance determinations.\nLines of Fe I give, on average, a 0.1 dex lower abundance compared to those of\nFe II lines for HD 61421 and HD 102870, even when applying a differential\nanalysis relative to the Sun. A disparity between Fe I and Fe II points to\nproblems of stellar atmosphere modelling or/and effective temperature\ndetermination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 15:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
