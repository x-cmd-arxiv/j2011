In this paper,\nwe report an experimental demonstration of ionic Raman scattering and show that\nthis mechanism is relevant to optical control in solids. The key insight is\nthat a rectified phonon field can exert a directional force onto the crystal,\ninducing an abrupt displacement of the atoms from the equilibrium positions\nthat could not be achieved through excitation of an IR-active vibration alone,\nfor which the force is oscillatory.

In this letter, we compute\nevolutionary tracks and isochrones of models with and without rotation. We find\nthat, for the same age and input physics, both kinds of models present\nturn-offs with an almost identical position in the colour-magnitude diagrams.\nAs a consequence, a dispersion of rotational velocities in coeval ensembles of\nstars could not explain the presence of MMSTOs. We construct several synthetic\ncolour-magnitude diagrams for the different kinds of tracks and combinations of\nthem. The models that best reproduce the morphology of observed MMSTOs are\nclearly those assuming a significant spread in the stellar ages - as long as\n~400 Myr - added to a moderate amount of convective core overshooting. Only\nthese models produce the detailed \"golf club\" shape of observed MMSTOs. A\nspread in rotational velocities alone cannot do anything similar. We also\ndiscuss models involving a mixture of stars with and without overshooting, as\nan additional scenario to producing MMSTOs with coeval populations.

In the extended model large density fluctuations leading to large\ndifferential fluid accelerations are accounted for. This is an essential\ningredient to represent the strong coupling between the density and velocity\nfields in VD hydrodynamics driven by active scalar mixing. The small scale\nanisotropy, a fundamentally \"non-Kolmogorovian\" feature of\npressure-gradient-driven flows, is captured by a tensorial stochastic diffusion\nterm. The extension is so constructed that it reduces to the original Langevin\nmodel in the limit of constant density.

The second\nencoding method is to simply implement the $[7,1,3]$ encoding gate sequence\nalso in the non-equiprobable Pauli operator error environment. Perfect error\ncorrection is applied after both methods to determine the correctability of the\nimplemented errors. I find that which method attains a higher fidelity depends\non the which of Pauli operator errors is dominant. Nevertheless, perfect error\ncorrection supresses errors to at least first order for both methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 20:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 13:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In all cases, there are frequency ranges where\nthe bicoherence, a measure of nonlinearity, is strong for frequencies involving\nthe frequency of the quasi-periodic oscillations, indicating that the\nquasi-periodic oscillations are coupled to the noise components, rather than\nbeing generated independently. We compare the bicoherences from the data to\nsimple models, finding some qualitative similarities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 22:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We show that this effect would imply that the doubly charmed\nbaryons are very compact. One intriguing possibility is that such baryons have\na linear geometry Q-q-Q where the light quark q oscillates between the two\nheavy quarks Q, analogous to a linear molecule such as carbon dioxide. However,\nusing conventional arguments, the size of a heavy-light hadron is expected to\nbe around 0.5 fm, much larger than the size needed to explain the observed\nlarge isospin splitting. Assuming the distance between two heavy quarks is much\nsmaller than that between the light quark and a heavy one, the doubly heavy\nbaryons are related to the heavy mesons via heavy quark-diquark symmetry. Based\non this symmetry, we predict the isospin splittings for doubly heavy baryons\nincluding Xi_{cc}, Xi_{bb} and Xi_{bc}. The prediction for the Xi_{cc} is much\nsmaller than the SELEX value. On the other hand, the Xi_{bb} baryons are\npredicted to have an isospin splitting as large as (6.3\\pm1.7) MeV. An\nexperimental study of doubly bottomed baryons is therefore very important to\nbetter understand the structure of baryons with heavy quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 22:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

Therefore, the SOFIA\ndata reduction software must run code which has been developed in a variety of\ndissimilar environments which will only increase in future generations of\ninstrumentation. We investigated three distinctly different situations for\nperforming pipelined data reduction in SOFIA: automated data reduction after\ndata archival at the end of a mission, re-pipelining of science data with\nupdated calibrations or optimum parameters, and the interactive user-driven\nlocal execution and analysis of data reduction by an investigator. These\ndifferent modes would traditionally result in very different software\nimplementations of algorithms used by each instrument team, in effect tripling\nthe amount of data reduction software that would need to be maintained by\nSOFIA. We present here a unique approach for enfolding all the\ninstrument-specific data reduction software in the observatory framework and\nverifies the needs for all three reduction scenarios as well as the standard\nvisualization tools. The SOFIA data reduction structure would host the\ndifferent algorithms and techniques that the instrument teams develop in their\nown environment. Ideally, duplication of software is minimized across the\nsystem because instrument teams can draw on software solutions and techniques\npreviously delivered to SOFIA by other instruments. With this approach, we\nminimize the effort for analyzing and developing new software reduction\npipelines for future generation instruments. We also explore the potential\nbenefits of this approach in the portability of the software to an\never-broadening science audience, as well as its ability to ease the use of\ndistributed processing for data reduction pipelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 01:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

For slowly aging or fully aged\nsystems, the main features of the barrier-height distribution are determined by\nthe effective temperature and other near-equilibrium properties of the\nconfigurational degrees of freedom. Our theory accounts for the wide range of\nrelaxation rates observed in both structural glasses and soft glassy materials\nsuch as colloidal suspensions. We find that the frequency dependent loss\nmodulus is not just a superposition of Maxwell modes. Rather, it exhibits an\n$\\alpha$ peak that rises near the viscous relaxation rate and, for nearly\njammed, glassy systems, extends to much higher frequencies in accord with\nexperimental observations. We also use this theory to compute strain recovery\nfollowing a period of large, persistent deformation and then abrupt unloading.\nWe find that strain recovery is determined in part by the initial\nbarrier-height distribution, but that true structural aging also occurs during\nthis process and determines the system's response to subsequent perturbations.\nIn particular, we find by comparison with experimental data that the initial\ndeformation produces a highly disordered state with a large population of low\nactivation barriers, and that this state relaxes quickly toward one in which\nthe distribution is dominated by the high barriers predicted by the\nnear-equilibrium analysis.

The\nproposed modeling framework induces a prior on a collection of covariance\nmatrices indexed by predictors through priors for predictor-dependent loadings\nmatrices in a factor model. In particular, the predictor-dependent loadings are\ncharacterized as a sparse combination of a collection of unknown dictionary\nfunctions (e.g, Gaussian process random functions).

We start by reviewing the difficulties found when trying to impose\nthe Lorenz condition in a time-dependent geometry. Motivated by this fact, we\nexplore the possibility of extending the electromagnetic theory by allowing the\nscalar state which is usually eliminated by means of the Lorenz condition to\npropagate, preserving at the same time the dynamics of ordinary transverse\nphotons. We show that the new state cannot be generated by charged currents,\nbut it breaks conformal invariance and can be excited gravitationally. In fact,\nprimordial quantum fluctuations produced during inflation can give rise to\nsuper-Hubble temporal electromagnetic modes whose energy density behaves as a\ncosmological constant. The value of the effective cosmological constant is\nshown to agree with observations provided inflation took place at the\nelectroweak scale. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests\nand is free from classical or quantum instabilities. Thus we see that, not only\nthe true nature of dark energy can be established without resorting to new\nphysics, but also the value of the cosmological constant finds a natural\nexplanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology. On sub-Hubble\nscales, the new state generates an effective charge density which, due to the\nhigh electric conductivity of the cosmic plasma after inflation, gives rise to\nboth vorticity and magnetic fields. Present upper limits on vorticity coming\nfrom CMB anisotropies are translated into lower limits on the present value of\ncosmic magnetic fields. We find that magnetic fields $B_{\\lambda}> 10^{-12}$ G\ncan be typically generated with coherence lengths ranging from sub-galactic\nscales up to the present Hubble radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 09:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

It appears that in\norder to have an appropriate string/MQM correspondence we must need to impose a\nconstraint on the matrix model side which is equivalent to an operator\nconstraint on the matter part of the boundary state that arises from open\nstring boundary condition. This condition constrains the Hilbert space\ngenerated by the macroscopic loop operator but the bulk matrix model remains\nunaffected, thereby describing a situation parallel to string theory. We have\nanalyzed the constrained theory with uncompactified as well as compactified\ntime and have shown that it is in good agreement with string theory. Without\nthis constraint, the grand canonical partition function for MQM on a circle in\nthe presence of the brane diverges while the constrained partition function is\nfinite and corresponds to that of a deformed Fermi surface, as expected within\nthe compactified theory. Matrix model path integral on a circle in the presence\nof the brane is expressed as Fredholm determinant. We consider matrix model in\nthe presence of the brane, to be perturbed by momentum modes. We obtain the\nexpression of MQM wave function in this background from collective field theory\nanalysis. We have shown with the help of this constraint that the grand\ncanonical partition function has an integrable structure and can be expressed\nas tau function of Toda hierarchy. Finally we have analyzed the dispersionless\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 11:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 23:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

A\nsimple technique which allows to obtain high-quality photometric measurements\nwith 0.3-1 s time resolution using ordinary CCD is described in detail. Using\nthe test observations of nonvariable stars, we show that the atmospheric\nturbulence introduces no significant distortions into the measured light\ncurves. Therefore, the data obtained in this way are well suited for studying\nthe aperiodic variability of various objects.\n  The large amount of SS 433 optical light curve measurements obtained in this\nway allowed us to obtain the power spectra of its flux variability with a\nrecord sensitivity up to frequencies of ~0.5 Hz and to detect its break at\nfrequency =~2.4e-3 Hz. We suggest that this break in the power spectrum results\nfrom the smoothing of the optical flux variability due to a finite size of the\nemitting region. Based on our measurement of the break frequency in the power\nspectrum, we estimated the size of the accretion-disk photosphere as 2e12 cm.\nWe show that the amplitude of the variability in SS 433 decreases sharply\nduring accretion-disk eclipses, but it does not disappear completely. This\nsuggests that the size of the variable optical emission source is comparable to\nthat of the normal star whose size is therefore R_O \\approx 2e12 cm \\approx 30\nR_sun. The decrease in flux variability amplitude during eclipses suggests the\npresence of a nonvariable optical emission component with a magnitude\nm_R=~13.2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 14:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In theory, criticality provides many desirable\nfeatures for the behaving brain, optimizing computational capabilities,\ninformation transmission, sensitivity to sensory stimuli and size of memory\nrepertoires. However, a thorough characterization of neuronal avalanches in\nfreely-behaving (FB) animals is still missing, thus raising doubts about their\nrelevance for brain function. To address this issue, we employed chronically\nimplanted multielectrode arrays (MEA) to record avalanches of spikes from the\ncerebral cortex (V1 and S1) and hippocampus (HP) of 14 rats, as they\nspontaneously traversed the wake-sleep cycle, explored novel objects or were\nsubjected to anesthesia (AN). We then modeled spike avalanches to evaluate the\nimpact of sparse MEA sampling on their statistics. We found that the size\ndistribution of spike avalanches are well fit by lognormal distributions in FB\nanimals, and by truncated power laws in the AN group. The FB data are also\ncharacterized by multiple key features compatible with criticality in the\ntemporal domain, such as 1/f spectra and long-term correlations as measured by\ndetrended fluctuation analysis. These signatures are very stable across waking,\nslow-wave sleep and rapid-eye-movement sleep, but collapse during anesthesia.\nLikewise, waiting time distributions obey a single scaling function during all\nnatural behavioral states, but not during anesthesia. Results are equivalent\nfor neuronal ensembles recorded from V1, S1 and HP. Altogether, the data\nprovide a comprehensive link between behavior and brain criticality, revealing\na unique scale-invariant regime of spike avalanches across all major behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 16:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-18"}

Scaling laws and the\ndevelopment of anisotropy are studied in spectral space, and in real space\nusing an axisymmetric decomposition of velocity and passive scalar structure\nfunctions. The passive scalar is more anisotropic than the velocity field, and\nits power spectrum follows a spectral law consistent with $\\sim\nk_\\perp^{-3/2}$. This scaling is explained with phenomenological arguments that\nconsider the effect of rotation. Intermittency is characterized using scaling\nexponents and probability density functions of velocity and passive scalar\nincrements. In the presence of rotation, intermittency in the velocity field\ndecreases more noticeably than in the passive scalar. The scaling exponents\nshow good agreement with Kraichnan's prediction for passive scalar\nintermittency in two-dimensions, after correcting for the observed scaling of\nthe second order exponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 17:22:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2011 18:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
