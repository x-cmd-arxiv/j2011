Distributed solutions (e.g., the\nprimal-dual gradient method) have been intensively investigated under fading\nchannels. As such distributed solutions involve iterative updating and explicit\nmessage passing, it is unrealistic to assume that the wireless channel remains\nunchanged during the iterations. Unfortunately, the behavior of those\ndistributed solutions under time-varying channels is in general unknown. In\nthis paper, we shall investigate the convergence behavior and tracking errors\nof the iterative primal-dual scaled gradient algorithm (PDSGA) with dynamic\nscaling matrices (DSC) for solving distributive NUM problems under time-varying\nfading channels. We shall also study a specific application example, namely the\nmulti-commodity flow control and multi-carrier power allocation problem in\nmulti-hop ad hoc networks. Our analysis shows that the PDSGA converges to a\nlimit region rather than a single point under the finite state Markov chain\n(FSMC) fading channels. We also show that the order of growth of the tracking\nerrors is given by O(T/N), where T and N are the update interval and the\naverage sojourn time of the FSMC, respectively. Based on this analysis, we\nderive a low complexity distributive adaptation algorithm for determining the\nadaptive scaling matrices, which can be implemented distributively at each\ntransmitter. The numerical results show the superior performance of the\nproposed dynamic scaling matrix algorithm over several baseline schemes, such\nas the regular primal-dual gradient algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2011 07:36:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 01:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 07:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The algebra is a sort of \"intermediate\"\nalgebra between the symmetric algebra and the Rees algebra of an ideal, which\nserves the purpose of introducing the characteristic cycle of a hypersurface in\nintersection theory. The results described in the present paper have an\nalgebraic flavor and naturally connect with various themes of commutative\nalgebra, such as standard bases \\'a la Hironaka, Artin--Rees like questions,\nValabrega--Valla ideals, ideals of linear type, relation type and analytic\nspread. We give estimates for the dimension of the Aluffi algebra and show\nthat, pretty generally, the latter is equidimensional whenever the base ring is\na hypersurface ring. There is a converse to this under certain conditions that\nessentially subsume the setup in Aluffi's theory, thus suggesting that this\nalgebra will not handle cases other than the singular locus of a hypersurface.\nThe torsion and the structure of the minimal primes of the algebra are\nclarified. In the case of a projective hypersurface the results are more\nprecise and one is naturally led to look at families of projective plane\nsingular curves to understand how the property of being of linear type\ndeforms/specializes for the singular locus of a member. It is fairly elementary\nto show that the singular locus of an irreducible curve of degree at most 3 is\nof linear type. This is roundly false in degree larger than 4 and the picture\nlooks pretty wild as we point out by means of some families. Degree 4 is the\nintriguing case.

Its special and confluent forms take names as\nMathieu, Lam\\'{e} and Coulomb spheroidal equations. For these equations\nwhenever a power series solution is written, instead of a two-way recursion\nrelation between the coefficients in the series, we find one between three or\nfour different ones. An integral transform solution using simpler functions\nalso is not obtainable. The use of this equation in physics and mathematical\nliterature exploded in the later years, more than doubling the number of papers\nwith these solutions in the last decade, compared to time period since this\nequation was introduced in 1889 up to 2008. We use SCI data to conclude this\nstatement, which is not precise, but in the correct ballpark. Here this\nequation will be introduced and examples for its use, especially in general\nrelativity literature will be given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2011 08:49:42 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 08:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 08:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 08:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 20:19:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 06:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 09:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 06:28:13 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 14:25:36 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 09:39:48 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 08:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

The crystal's structural length scales may\nrange from nano- (light) up to centimeters (sound waves). Because of their\nemergent properties these materials are called metamaterials. Different to\nphotonics, where the dielectric constant dominantly determines the index of\nrefraction, in a ferromagnet the spin-wave index of refraction can be\ndramatically changed already by the magnetization direction. This allows a\ndifferent flexibility in realizing dynamic wave guides or spin-wave switches.\nThe present review will give an introduction into the novel functionalities of\nspin-wave devices, concepts for spin-wave based computing and magnonic\ncrystals. The parameters of the magnetic metamaterials are adjusted to the\nspin-wave k-vector such that the magnonic band structure is designed. However,\nalready the elementary building block of an antidot lattice, the singular hole,\nowns a strongly varying internal potential determined by its magnetic dipole\nfield and a localization of spin-wave modes.

The occurrence\nof repeated reflection, transmission and trapping regions for increasing\nstrengths of an optical lattice defect are shown to be due to impurity modes\ninside the defect potential with chemical potentials and numbers of atoms\nmatching corresponding quantities of an incoming gap-soliton. For gap-solitons\nwith chemical potentials very close to band edges, the number of resonances\nobserved in the scattering coincides with the number of bound states which can\nexist in the defect potential for the given defect strength. The dependence of\nthe positions and widths of the transmission resonant on the incoming\ngap-soliton velocities are investigated by means of a defect mode analysis and\neffective mass theory.

In this paper we\nexplore the apparent paradox in a quantitative analysis of information\ndiffusion on Twitter. Twitter is interesting in this context as it has been\nshown to present both the characteristics social and news media. The basic\nmeasure of virality in Twitter is the probability of retweet. Twitter is\ndifferent from email in that retweeting does not depend on pre-existing social\nrelations, but often occur among strangers, thus in this respect Twitter may be\nmore similar to traditional news media. We therefore hypothesize that negative\nnews content is more likely to be retweeted, while for non-news tweets positive\nsentiments support virality. To test the hypothesis we analyze three corpora: A\ncomplete sample of tweets about the COP15 climate summit, a random sample of\ntweets, and a general text corpus including news. The latter allows us to train\na classifier that can distinguish tweets that carry news and non-news\ninformation. We present evidence that negative sentiment enhances virality in\nthe news segment, but not in the non-news segment. We conclude that the\nrelation between affect and virality is more complex than expected based on the\nfindings of Berger and Milkman (2010), in short 'if you want to be cited: Sweet\ntalk your friends or serve bad news to the public'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2011 12:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The population synthesis calculations we use are based on the\nplanet formation model developed in Alibert et al.

Using this model, we generate synthetic\npopulations of planets by following their growth in a large number of\nproto-planetary disks, whose properties (mass and lifetime) are selected in a\nMonte Carlo fashion using probability distributions derived from observations.\nWe show that the scaling of the proto-planetary disk mass with the mass of the\ncentral star has a direct and large influence on the properties of the\nresulting planet population. In particular, the observed paucity of large mass\nplanets orbiting 0.5 Msun stars can directly be explained as resulting from a\nonly slightly steeper than linear scaling. The observed lack of short period\nplanet orbiting 2.0 Msun stars can also be attributed to this scaling but only\nif associated with a decrease of the mean disk lifetime for stars more massive\nthan 1.5 Msun. Finally, we show that the distribution of minimum mass and\nsemi-major axis of our synthetic planets are statistically comparable with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2011 13:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

One of the necessary steps for\nextracting polarization information in the CMB is reducing contamination from\nso-called \"ambiguous modes\" on a masked sky, which contain leakage from the\nlarger E-mode signal. This can be achieved by utilising derivative operators on\nthe real-space Stokes Q and U parameters. This paper presents an algorithm and\na software package to perform this procedure on the nearly full sky, i.e., with\nprojects such as the Planck Surveyor and future satellites in mind; in\nparticular, the package can perform finite differences on masked, irregular\ngrids and is applied to a semi-regular spherical pixellization, the HEALPix\ngrid. The formalism reduces to the known finite-difference solutions in the\ncase of a regular grid. We quantify full-sky improvements on the possible\nbounds on the CMB B-mode signal. We find that in the specific case of E and\nB-mode separation, there exists a \"pole problem\" in our formalism which\nproduces signal contamination at very low multipoles l. Several solutions to\nthe \"pole problem\" are presented; one proposed solution facilitates a\ncalculation of a general Gaussian quadrature scheme, which finds application in\ncalculating accurate harmonic coefficients on the HEALPix sphere. Nevertheless,\non a masked sphere the software represents a considerable reduction in B-mode\nnoise from limited sky coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2011 13:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 17:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 16:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 01:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We find a\nluminosity-dependent bias: template-based K-corrections overestimate the\nluminosity of low-luminosity QSOs, likely due to their reliance on templates\nderived from higher luminosity QSOs. Combining our sample with bright quasars\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and using spectrum-based M1450 for all the\nquasars, we fit a double-power-law to the binned QLF. Our best fit has a\nbright-end slope, {\\alpha} = 3.3\\pm0.2, and faint-end slope, {\\beta} =\n1.6(+0.8/-0.6). Our new data revise the faint-end slope of the QLF down to\nflatter values similar to those measured at z ~ 3. The break luminosity, though\npoorly constrained, is at M* = -24.1(+0.7/-1.9), approximately 1 - 1.5 mag\nfainter than at z ~ 3.
