It provides an online approach to state estimation\ninverse problems when data is acquired sequentially. The Kalman filter plays a\ncentral role in many applications because it is exact for linear systems\nsubject to Gaussian noise, and because it forms the basis for many approximate\nfilters which are used in high dimensional systems. The aim of this paper is to\nstudy the effect of model error on the Kalman filter, in the context of linear\nwave propagation problems. A consistency result is proved when no model error\nis present, showing recovery of the true signal in the large data limit. This\nresult, however, is not robust: it is also proved that arbitrarily small model\nerror can lead to inconsistent recovery of the signal in the large data limit.\nIf the model error is in the form of a constant shift to the velocity, the\nfiltering and smoothing distributions only recover a partial Fourier expansion,\na phenomenon related to aliasing. On the other hand, for a class of wave\nvelocity model errors which are time-dependent, it is possible to recover the\nfiltering distribution exactly, but not the smoothing distribution. Numerical\nresults are presented which corroborate the theory, and also to propose a\ncomputational approach which overcomes the inconsistency in the presence of\nmodel error, by relaxing the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 16:04:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 20:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

It is proved that $Q_l(Q_l(R))=Q_l(R)$; the ring $Q_l(R)$ is semi-simple\niff $Q_{cl}(R)$ exists and is semi-simple; moreover, if the ring $Q_l(R)$ is\nleft artinian then $Q_{cl}(R)$ exists and $Q_l(R) = Q_{cl}(R)$.

To search for more dust disks of the latter type, we have conducted a\nSpitzer MIPS 24 um survey of 71 hot WDs or pre-WDs, among which 35 are central\nstars of PNe (CSPNs). Nine of these evolved stars are detected and their 24 um\nflux densities are at least two orders of magnitude higher than their expected\nphotospheric emission. Considering the bias against detection of distant\nobjects, the 24 um detection rate for the sample is >~15%. It is striking that\nseven, or ~20%, of the WD and pre-WDs in known PNe exhibit 24 um excesses,\nwhile two, or 5-6%, of the WDs not in PNe show 24 um excesses and they have the\nlowest 24 um flux densities. We have obtained follow-up Spitzer IRS spectra for\nfive objects. Four show clear continuum emission at 24 um, and one is\noverwhelmed by a bright neighboring star but still show a hint of continuum\nemission. In the cases of WD 0950+139 and CSPN K1-22, a late-type companion is\npresent, making it difficult to determine whether the excess 24 um emission is\nassociated with the WD or its red companion. High-resolution images in the\nmid-IR are needed to establish unambiguously the stars responsible for the 24\num excesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 19:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 06:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In the\npresent work, we report new constraints on these issues, through the long term\nstudy of the radio and X-ray behaviour of the black hole candidate H1743-322.\nThis source is known to be one of the `outliers' of the universal radio/X-ray\ncorrelation, i.e. a group of accreting stellar-mass black holes displaying\nfainter radio emission for a given X-ray luminosity than expected from the\ncorrelation. Our study shows that the radio and X-ray emission of H1743-322 are\nstrongly correlated at high luminosity in the hard spectral state. However,\nthis correlation is unusually steep for a black hole X-ray binary: b ~ 1.4\n(with L_{Radio} \\propto L_{X}^{b}). Below a critical luminosity, the\ncorrelation becomes shallower until it rejoins the standard correlation with b\n~ 0.6. Based on these results, we first show that the steep correlation can be\nexplained if the inner accretion flow is radiatively efficient during the hard\nstate, in contrast to what is usually assumed for black hole X-ray binaries in\nthis spectral state. The transition between the steep and the standard\ncorrelation would therefore reflect a change from a radiatively efficient to a\nradiatively inefficient accretion flow. Finally, we investigate the possibility\nthat the discrepancy between `outliers' and `standard' black holes arises from\nthe outflow properties rather than from the accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 21:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

It has later\nbeen shown that Landau's two-fluid model can be rigorously derived from a\none-fluid model within the classical fields approximation. Assuming a\nseparation of scales exists between the slowly varying, large-scale, background\n(condensate) field, and the short rapidly evolving excitations, a full\ndescription of the kinetics between the condensate and the thermal cloud can be\nobtained. The kinetics describes three-wave and four-wave interactions that\nresemble the C_{12} and C_{22} terms, respectively, in the collision integral\nof the ZNG theory. The scale separation assumption precludes analysis of the\nhealing layer and thus does not include the dynamics of quantised vortices.\nWhilst the analysis required the use of small parameters arising from the scale\nseparation assumption and the assumption of a weakly depleted condensate, we\nexpect the results to hold true over a wider range of parameters. This belief\nis motivated by the validity of Landau's two-fluid model which can be derived\nfrom a one-fluid model using nothing more than Galilean invariance principles.\nIndeed, we argue that similar arguments can be used to recover a two-fluid\nmodel directly from a classical field simply by invoking a local gauge\ntransformation. This derivation does not require any small parameters to be\nintroduced suggesting that the results that lead to the kinetic equations may\nturn out to be more general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 23:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-28"}

Spitzer-IRAC+MIPS\nphotometry, supplemented by ISOPHOT data at 90 micron and 170 micron, has been\nused to calculate accurate total infrared luminosities, LIR(8-1000 micron), and\nto determine the IR luminosity function (LF) of luminous infrared galaxies\n(LIRGs). The maximum observed redshift is z~0.80 and the maximum total infrared\nluminosity is log(L_IR/L_Sun)=12.74. Over the luminosity range\nlog(L_IR/L_Sun)=10-12, the LF for LIRGs in the Lockman Hole Deep Field is\nsimilar to that found previously for local sources at similar infrared\nluminosities. The mean host galaxy mass, log(M/M_Sun)=10.7, and dominance of\nHII-region spectral types, is also similar to what has been found for local\nLIRGs, suggesting that intense starbursts likely power the bulk of the infrared\nluminosity for sources in this range of LIR. However for the most luminous\nsources, log(L_IR/L_Sun)>12.0, we find evidence for strong evolution in the LF\n\\propto (1+z)6\\pm1, assuming pure number density evolution. These ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxies (ULIRGs) have a larger mean host mass, log(M/M_Sun)=11.0, and\nexhibit disturbed morphologies consistent with strong-interactions/mergers, and\nthey are also more likely to be characterized by starburst-AGN composite or AGN\nspectral types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 03:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

The idea is to replace a\nHamiltonian $H$ for which analytical solutions are not known by another one\n$\\tilde H$, including one or more auxiliary fields. For instance, a potential\n$V(r)$ not solvable is replaced by another one $P(r)$ more familiar, or a\nsemirelativistic kinetic part is replaced by an equivalent nonrelativistic one.\nThe approximation comes from the replacement of the auxiliary fields by pure\nreal constants. The approximant solutions for $H$, eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions, are then obtained by the solutions of $\\tilde H$ in which the\nauxiliary parameters are eliminated by an extremization procedure for the\neigenenergies. If $H=T(\\bm p)+V(r)$ and if $P(r)$ is a power law, the\napproximate eigenvalues can be written $T(p_0)+V(r_0)$, where the mean\nimpulsion $p_0$ is a function of the mean distance $r_0$ and where $r_0$ is\ndetermined by an equation which is linked to the generalized virial theorem.\nThe general properties of the method are studied and the connections with the\nenvelope theory presented. This method is first applied to nonrelativistic and\nsemirelativistic two-body systems, with a great variety of potentials. Closed\nformulae are produced for energies, eigenstates, various observables and\ncritical constants, with sometimes a very good accuracy.

These issues are important to\nresolve because confidence has been undermined in their use for DEM analysis,\nand Fe VIII is the main contributor to the AIA 131A channel at low\ntemperatures. Furthermore, they are the best EIS lines to use for velocity\nstudies, and for assigning the correct temperature to velocity measurements in\nthe fans. We find that the Fe VIII 185.213A line is particularly sensitive to\nthe slope of the DEM, leading to disproportionate changes in its effective\nformation temperature. If the DEM has a steep gradient in the log T/K = 5.6 to\n5.8 range, or is strongly peaked, Fe VIII 185.213A and Si VII 275.368A will be\nformed at the same temperature. We show that this effect explains the\nsimilarity of these images in the fans. Furthermore, we show that the most\nrecent ionization balance compilations resolve the discrepancies in absolute\nintensities. We then combine EIS and AIA to determine the temperature structure\nof a number of fan loops and find that they have peak temperatures of\n0.8--1.2MK.

For many real physico-chemical\ncomplex systems (e.g. homogeneous combustion, heterogeneous catalytic\noxidation, most enzyme reactions etc), detailed mechanisms include both\nreversible and irreversible reactions. In this case, the principle of detailed\nbalance cannot be applied directly. We represent irreversible reactions as\nlimits of reversible steps and obtain the principle of detailed balance for\ncomplex mechanisms with some irreversible elementary processes. We proved two\nconsequences of the detailed balance for these mechanisms: the structural\ncondition and the algebraic condition that form together the extended form of\ndetailed balance. The algebraic condition is the principle of detailed balance\nfor the reversible part. The structural condition is: the convex hull of the\nstoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection\nwith the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reaction.\nPhysically, this means that the irreversible reactions cannot be included in\noriented pathways. The systems with the extended form of detailed balance are\nalso the limits of the reversible systems with detailed balance when some of\nthe equilibrium concentrations (or activities) tend to zero. Surprisingly, the\nstructure of the limit reaction mechanism crucially depends on the relative\nspeeds of this tendency to zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 13:24:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 21:52:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 19:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-24"}

Isotope shifts and hyperfine structures are calculated.\nThe achieved accuracy of the latter is of the order of 0.1 MHz.\nIntra-configuration transition probabilities are also estimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 15:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The latter observation has\nnot prevented the design of image representations, which trade off between\nefficiency and complexity, while achieving accurate rendering of smooth regions\nas well as reproducing faithful contours and textures. The most recent ones,\nproposed in the past decade, share an hybrid heritage highlighting the\nmultiscale and oriented nature of edges and patterns in images. This paper\npresents a panorama of the aforementioned literature on decompositions in\nmultiscale, multi-orientation bases or dictionaries. They typically exhibit\nredundancy to improve sparsity in the transformed domain and sometimes its\ninvariance with respect to simple geometric deformations (translation,\nrotation). Oriented multiscale dictionaries extend traditional wavelet\nprocessing and may offer rotation invariance. Highly redundant dictionaries\nrequire specific algorithms to simplify the search for an efficient (sparse)\nrepresentation. We also discuss the extension of multiscale geometric\ndecompositions to non-Euclidean domains such as the sphere or arbitrary meshed\nsurfaces. The etymology of panorama suggests an overview, based on a choice of\npartially overlapping \"pictures\". We hope that this paper will contribute to\nthe appreciation and apprehension of a stream of current research directions in\nimage understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 15:53:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 07:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-27"}

We\nintroduce the concept of hyper-brain network, a connectivity pattern\nrepresenting at once the information flow among the cortical regions of a\nsingle brain as well as the relations among the areas of two distinct brains.\nGraph analysis of hyper-brain networks constructed from the EEG scanning of 26\ncouples of individuals playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma reveals the\npossibility to predict non-cooperative interactions during the decision-making\nphase. The hyper-brain networks of two-defector couples have significantly less\ninter-brain links and overall higher modularity - i.e. the tendency to form two\nseparate subgraphs - than couples playing cooperative or tit-for-tat\nstrategies. The decision to defect can be \"read\" in advance by evaluating the\nchanges of connectivity pattern in the hyper-brain network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 15:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-28"}
