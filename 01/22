The belief propagation algorithm, which is an exact procedure to compute\nthese marginals when the underlying graph is a tree, has gained its popularity\nas an efficient way to approximate them in the more general case. In this\npaper, we focus on an aspect of the algorithm that did not get that much\nattention in the literature, which is the effect of the normalization of the\nmessages. We show in particular that, for a large class of normalization\nstrategies, it is possible to focus only on belief convergence. Following this,\nwe express the necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability of a\nfixed point in terms of the graph structure and the beliefs values at the fixed\npoint. We also explicit some connexion between the normalization constants and\nthe underlying Bethe Free Energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 16:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-24"}

The dynamics of inertial particles is\nstudied using Lagrangian modelling in forced temperature-stratified turbulence,\nwhereas non-inertial particles and the fluid are described using DNS in an\nEulerian framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 17:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2011 10:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 19:03:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 13:51:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 18:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-28"}

Since January\n2009, eight reactors with a capacity of 4.9 GWe have been connected to the\nelectric grid and four older reactors, with a combined capacity of 2.64 GWe\nhave been terminated. Furthermore, 27 reactor constructions, dominated by China\n(18) and Russia (4), have been initiated.\n  The nuclear fission produced electric energy in 2009 followed the slow\ndecline, observed since 2007, with a total production of 2560 TWhe, 41 TWhe\n(1.6%) less than in 2008 and roughly 100 TWhe less than in the record year\n2006. The preliminary data from the first 10 months of 2010 in the OECD\ncountries indicate that nuclear power production in North-America remained at\nthe 2009 levels, while one observes a recovery in Europe with an increase of\n2.5% and a strong rise of 5% in the OECD Asia-Pacific area compared to the same\nperiod in 2009.\n  Worldwide uranium mining has increased during 2009 by about 7000 tons to\nalmost 51000 tons. Still roughly 18000 tons of the 2010 world uranium\nrequirements need to be provided from the civilian and military reserves.\n  Perhaps the most remarkable new data from the just published 2009 edition of\nthe Red Book, are that (1) the best understood RAR (reasonable assured) and IR\n(inferred) resources, with a price tag of less than 40 US dollars/Kg, have been\ninconsistently absorbed in the two to three times higher price categories and\n(2) uranium mining in Kazakhstan is presented with a short lifetime. The\npresented mining capacity numbers indicate an uranium extraction peak of 28000\ntons during the years 2015-2020, from which it will decline quickly to 14000\ntons by 2025 and to only 5000-6000 tons by 2035.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 17:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-24"}

To better map the spatial\nextent of the Cloud along the line of sight, we have obtained multi-color UBVR\nphotometry for 1.2 million stars in 63 fields approximately 1 square degree\neach. Our analysis of the fields beyond the apparent boundaries of the excess\nhave already ruled out a triaxial thick disk as a likely explanation (Larsen,\nHumphreys and Cabanela 2010) In this paper we present our results for the star\ncounts over all of our fields, determine the spatial extent of the over density\nacross and along the line of sight, and estimate the size and mass of the\nCloud.

Our goal is to design\nscheduling schemes that do not use per-flow or per-destination information,\nmaintain a single data queue for each link, and exploit only local information,\nwhile guaranteeing throughput optimality. Although the celebrated back-pressure\nalgorithm maximizes throughput, it requires per-flow or per-destination\ninformation. It is usually difficult to obtain and maintain this type of\ninformation, especially in large networks, where there are numerous flows.\nAlso, the back-pressure algorithm maintains a complex data structure at each\nnode, keeps exchanging queue length information among neighboring nodes, and\ncommonly results in poor delay performance. In this paper, we propose\nscheduling schemes that can circumvent these drawbacks and guarantee throughput\noptimality. These schemes use either the readily available hop-count\ninformation or only the local information for each link. We rigorously analyze\nthe performance of the proposed schemes using fluid limit techniques via an\ninductive argument and show that they are throughput-optimal.

Attempts to\nmeasure this escape-fraction in intensely star-forming galaxies at lower\nredshifts have largely yielded upper limits. In this paper we present new HST\nCOS and archival FUSE far-UV spectroscopy of a sample of eleven Lyman Break\nAnalogs (LBAs), a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble the\nhigh-z Lyman Break galaxies. We combine these data with SDSS optical spectra\nand Spitzer photometry. We also analyze archival FUSE observations of fifteen\ntypical UV-bright local starbursts. We find evidence of small covering factors\nfor optically-thick neutral gas in 3 cases. This is based on two independent\npieces of evidence: a significant residual intensity in the cores of the\nstrongest interstellar absorption-lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratio\nof extinction-corrected H-alpha to UV plus far-IR luminosities. These objects\nrepresent three of the four LBAs that contain a young, very compact (~100pc),\nand highly massive (~10^9 Mo) dominant central object (DCO). These three\nobjects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount of\nblueshifted Ly-alpha emission, which may be related to the low covering factor\nof neutral gas. All four LBAs with DCOs in our sample show extremely high\nvelocity outflows of interstellar gas, with line centroids blueshifted by about\n700km/s and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500km/s.

In this work, we propose a\nmethodology for the concurrent error detection in reversible logic circuits to\ndetect faults that can result in multi-bit error at the outputs. The\nmethodology is based on the inverse property of reversible logic and is termed\nas 'inverse and compare' method. By using the inverse property of reversible\nlogic, all the inputs can be regenerated at the outputs. Thus, by comparing the\noriginal inputs with the regenerated inputs, the faults in reversible circuits\ncan be detected. Minimizing the garbage outputs is one of the main goals in\nreversible logic design and synthesis. We show that the proposed methodology\nresults in 'garbageless' reversible circuits. A design of reversible full adder\nthat can be concurrently tested for multi-bit error at the outputs is\nillustrated as the application of the proposed scheme.

Inefficient fueling (and/or\nfeedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but we\nargue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can\ntherefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has\nsignificantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.' Both of\nthese effects act together with comparable magnitude, and mean that the peak of\nBH growth can lag the peak in the SFR measured at a given scale by a timescale\ncorresponding to the gas exhaustion time on that scale (~ 10-100 local\ndynamical times).

Motivated by these\nfindings, this paper considers outflows from Hot Jupiters in the regime where\nthe flow is controlled by magnetic fields. Given the mass loss rates estimated\nfrom current observations --- and from theoretical arguments --- magnetic\nfields will dominate the flow provided that field strength near the planet is\ngreater than $\\sim1$ gauss, comparable to the surface fields of the Sun and\nJupiter. The problem can be separated into an inner regime, near the planet,\nwhere the outflow is launched, and an outer regime where the flow follows\n(primarily) stellar field lines and interacts with the stellar wind. This paper\nconcentrates on the flow in the inner regime. For a dipole planetary field with\na spatially constant background contribution, we construct a set of orthogonal\ncoordinates that follow the field lines and determine the corresponding\ndifferential operators. Under the assumption of isothermal flow, we\nanalytically find the conditions required for escaping material to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic transition, and then estimate the mass outflow\nrates.

As the correctness of the control\nparameters generated are critical to the safety of the system, a method to\nverify these parameters is a strong desire in the area of train control system.\nIn this paper, we present our ideas of how to model and verify the control\nparameter calculations in a CBTC system efficiently. - As the behavior of the\nsystem is highly nondeterministic, it is difficult to build and verify the\ncomplete behavior space model of the system online in advance.

We study the problem of Eulerian extension\n(EE) where a directed multigraph G and a weight function is given and it is\nasked whether G can be made Eulerian by adding arcs whose total weight does not\nexceed a given threshold. This problem is motivated through applications in\nvehicle routing and flowshop scheduling. However, EE is NP-hard and thus we use\nthe parameterized complexity framework to analyze it. In parameterized\ncomplexity, the running time of algorithms is considered not only with respect\nto input length, but also with respect to other properties of the input -\ncalled \"parameters\". Dorn et. al. proved that EE can be solved in O(4^k n^4)\ntime, where k denotes the parameter \"number of arcs that have to be added\". In\nthis thesis, we analyze EE with respect to the (smaller) parameters \"number c\nof connected components in the input graph\" and \"sum b over indeg(v) -\noutdeg(v) for all vertices v in the input graph where this value is positive\".\nWe prove that there is an algorithm for EE whose running time is polynomial\nexcept for the term 4^(c log(bc^2)). To obtain this result, we make several\nobservations about the sets of arcs that have to be added to the input graph in\norder to make it Eulerian. We build upon these observations to restate EE in a\nmatching context. This matching formulation of EE might be an important tool to\nsolve the question of whether EE can be solved within running time whose\nsuperpolynomial part depends only on c. We also consider polynomial time\npreprocessing routines for EE and show that these routines cannot yield\ninstances whose size depends polynomially only on either of the parameters b,\nc, k unless coNP is contained in NP/poly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2011 12:44:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 14:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Here we show that the kernel is monotone (i.e.,\nincreasing in both variables) if and only if the sequence satisfies a\n`quasi-monotonicity' property defined by a certain functional tending to zero.\nAs a tool we prove an inequality relating the cut and $L^1$ norms of kernels of\nthe form $W_1-W_2$ with $W_1$ and $W_2$ monotone that may be of interest in its\nown right; no such inequality holds for general kernels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2011 15:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

X-rays from the first sources, with large\nmean free paths, likely quickly heated the intergalactic medium (IGM). The\nsecond generation of 21cm instruments can provide a unique view into this early\nepoch. The early stages of reionization likely followed, driven by so-called\n\"minihalos\", i.e. molecularly-cooled halos. These small halos were susceptible\nto complex feedback mechanisms, especially from the soft-UV background which\npreceded reionization, resulting in complex and possibly extended early stages\nof reionization. When atomically-cooled galaxies emerged as the dominant\nionizers, reionization could proceed more rapidly, with these being less\nsensitive to radiative feedback than previously thought. Reionization could\nhave slowed in the final stages when the ionized bubbles grew larger than the\nseparation of Lyman limit absorption systems (LLSs). The final stages likely\ninvolved the photo-evaporation of LLSs, which by then regulated the rise of the\nUV background. I discuss the theoretical underpinnings of this narrative, as\nwell as how future 21cm observations may help shed light on the outstanding\nuncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 17:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
