The\nroutes followed so far essentially rely on thermodynamics, i.e. imposing the\nproper Hamiltonian and cooling the system towards its ground state. In rapidly\nrotating 2D harmonic traps the role of the transverse magnetic field is played\nby the angular velocity. For particle numbers significantly larger than unity,\nthe required angular momentum is very large and it can be obtained only for\nspinning frequencies extremely near to the deconfinement limit; consequently,\nthe required control on experimental parameters turns out to be far too\nstringent. Here we propose to follow instead a dynamic path starting from the\ngas confined in a rotating ring. The large moment of inertia of the fluid\nfacilitates the access to states with a large angular momentum, corresponding\nto a giant vortex. The initial ring-shaped trapping potential is then\nadiabatically transformed into a harmonic confinement, which brings the\ninteracting atomic gas in the desired quantum Hall regime. We provide clear\nnumerical evidence that for a relatively broad range of initial angular\nfrequencies, the giant vortex state is adiabatically connected to the bosonic\n$\\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state, and we discuss the scaling to many particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2011 18:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-31"}

But the main goal is to give a combinatorial proof of a\nTouchard-Riordan--like formula for q-secant numbers discovered by the first\nauthor.

Within the fireshell model, the canonical GRB\nlight curve presents two different components: the proper-GRB (P-GRB) and the\nextended afterglow. [...] In particular, the traditionally called short GRBs\ncan be either \"genuine\" short GRBs [...] or \"disguised\" short GRBs [...]. AIMS:\nWe verify whether GRB 050509b can be classified as a \"genuine\" short or a\n\"disguised\" short GRB, in the fireshell model. Methods: We investigate two\nalternative scenarios. In the first, we start from the assumption that this GRB\nis a \"genuine\" short burst. In the second attempt, we assume that this GRB is a\n\"disguised\" burst. Results: If GRB 050509b were a genuine short GRB, there\nshould initially be very hard emission which is ruled out by the observations.\nThe analysis that assumes that this is a disguised short GRB is compatible with\nthe observations. The theoretical model predicts a value of the extended\nafterglow energy peak that is consistent with the Amati relation. Conclusions:\nGRB 050509b cannot be classified as a \"genuine\" short GRB. The observational\ndata are consistent with a \"disguised\" short GRB classification, i.e., a long\nburst with a weak extended afterglow \"deflated\" by the low density of the CBM.\nWe expect that all short GRBs with measured redshifts are disguised short GRBs\nbecause of a selection effect: if there is enough energy in the afterglow to\nmeasure the redshift, then the proper GRB must be less energetic than the\nafterglow. The Amati relation is found to be fulfilled only by the extended\nafterglow excluding the P-GRB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2011 19:45:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 18:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 13:31:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 15:22:58 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 11:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-19"}

A key\nfeature of our model is that consumers experience a (positive) local network\neffect. In particular, each consumer's usage level depends directly on the\nusage of her neighbors in the social network structure. Thus, the monopolist's\noptimal pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to certain agents, who\nhave a central position in the underlying network.\n  First, we consider a setting where the monopolist can offer individualized\nprices and derive an explicit characterization of the optimal price for each\nconsumer as a function of her network position. In particular, we show that it\nis optimal for the monopolist to charge each agent a price that is proportional\nto her Bonacich centrality in the social network. In the second part of the\npaper, we discuss the optimal strategy of a monopolist that can only choose a\nsingle uniform price for the good and derive an algorithm polynomial in the\nnumber of agents to compute such a price. Thirdly, we assume that the\nmonopolist can offer the good in two prices, full and discounted, and study the\nproblem of determining which set of consumers should be given the discount. We\nshow that the problem is NP-hard, however we provide an explicit\ncharacterization of the set of agents that should be offered the discounted\nprice. Next, we describe an approximation algorithm for finding the optimal set\nof agents. We show that if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price\nallocation, the algorithm guarantees at least 88% of the optimal profit.\nFinally, we highlight the value of network information by comparing the profits\nof a monopolist that does not take into account the network effects when\nchoosing her pricing policy to those of a monopolist that uses this information\noptimally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2011 20:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-31"}

A pebbling\nmove across an edge of a graph takes two pebbles from one endpoint and places\none pebble at the other endpoint; the other pebble is lost in transit as a\ntoll. It has been shown that deciding whether a supply can meet a demand on a\ngraph is NP-complete. The pebbling number of a graph is the smallest t such\nthat every supply of t pebbles can satisfy every demand of one pebble. Deciding\nif the pebbling number is at most k is \\Pi_2^P-complete. In this paper we\ndevelop a tool, called the Weight Function Lemma, for computing upper bounds\nand sometimes exact values for pebbling numbers with the assistance of linear\noptimization. With this tool we are able to calculate the pebbling numbers of\nmuch larger graphs than in previous algorithms, and much more quickly as well.\nWe also obtain results for many families of graphs, in many cases by hand, with\nmuch simpler and remarkably shorter proofs than given in previously existing\narguments (certificates typically of size at most the number of vertices times\nthe maximum degree), especially for highly symmetric graphs. Here we apply the\nWeight Function Lemma to several specific graphs, including the Petersen,\nLemke, 4th weak Bruhat, Lemke squared, and two random graphs, as well as to a\nnumber of infinite families of graphs, such as trees, cycles, graph powers of\ncycles, cubes, and some generalized Petersen and Coxeter graphs. This partly\nanswers a question of Pachter, et al., by computing the pebbling exponent of\ncycles to within an asymptotically small range. It is conceivable that this\nmethod yields an approximation algorithm for graph pebbling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2011 22:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Although instigated by turbulence, the dynamic behavior proceeds to\nsufficiently large amplitudes that it couples to the nuclear burning. Dramatic\ngrowth of low order modes is seen, as well as large deviations from spherical\nsymmetry in the burning shells. The vigorous dynamics is more violent than that\nseen in earlier burning stages in the 3D simulations of a single cell in the\noxygen burning shell, or in 2D simulations not including an active Si shell.\nLinear perturbative analysis does not capture the chaotic behavior of\nturbulence (e.g., strange attractors such as that discovered by Lorenz), and\ntherefore badly underestimates the vigor of the instability.

Theoretically, cosmologically based models collate the physical\neffects driving galaxy assembly - mergers of galaxies, accretion of gas, star\nformation, and feedback, amongst others, to form predictions which are matched\nto galaxy observables. An alternative approach is to examine directly, in an\nobservational way, the processes driving galaxy assembly, including the effects\nof feedback. This is a new `third way' towards understanding how galaxies are\nforming from gas accretion and mergers, and directly probes these effects\ninstead of relying on simulations designed to reproduce observations.

For\npractical problems in which an appropriate sparsifying dictionary is not known\nahead of time, a very popular and successful heuristic is to search for a\ndictionary that minimizes an appropriate sparsity surrogate over a given set of\nsample data. While this idea is appealing, the behavior of these algorithms is\nlargely a mystery; although there is a body of empirical evidence suggesting\nthey do learn very effective representations, there is little theory to\nguarantee when they will behave correctly, or when the learned dictionary can\nbe expected to generalize. In this paper, we take a step towards such a theory.\nWe show that under mild hypotheses, the dictionary learning problem is locally\nwell-posed: the desired solution is indeed a local minimum of the $\\ell^1$\nnorm. Namely, if $\\mb A \\in \\Re^{m \\times n}$ is an incoherent (and possibly\novercomplete) dictionary, and the coefficients $\\mb X \\in \\Re^{n \\times p}$\nfollow a random sparse model, then with high probability $(\\mb A,\\mb X)$ is a\nlocal minimum of the $\\ell^1$ norm over the manifold of factorizations $(\\mb\nA',\\mb X')$ satisfying $\\mb A' \\mb X' = \\mb Y$, provided the number of samples\n$p = \\Omega(n^3 k)$.

A\ngeneral steady spiral solution of incompressible inviscid axisymmetric flow was\nobtained analytically by applying separation of variables to the 3D Euler\nequations. The solution, depending on 3 parameters, describes the spiral path\nof the fluid material element on the Bernoulli surface, whereas some new exact\nsolutions were obtained to be bounded within the whole region. The first one is\na continued typhoon-like vortex solution, where there are two intrinsic length\nscales. One is the radius of maximum circular velocity $r_m$, the other is the\nradius of the vortex kernel $r_k=\\sqrt{2}r_m$. The second one is a multi-planar\nsolution, periodically in $z$-coordinate. Within each layer, the solution is a\numbrella vortex similar to the first one. The third one is also a multi-planar\nsolution in $z$-coordinate. In each layer, it is a combination of two\nindependent solutions like the Rankine vortex, which is also finite but\ndiscontinued for either vertical or horizontal velocity. The fourth one is a\nmulti-paraboloid vortex solution finite for $z$-coordinate but infinite for\n$r$-coordinate. Besides, some classical simple solutions (Rankine vortex,\nBatchelor vortex, Hill spherical vortex, etc.) were also obtained.

Here we\npresent a technique called bit-mapped gating, which is an elegant way to force\nthe detections in the middle of the detector gate by coupling detection time\nand quantum bit error rate.
