Typically, we find that the initial masses of\nGCs must be ~8-10 times (or up to 25 times, if second generation stars also\nescape from GCs) larger than the present-day stellar mass. The present-day\nGalactic GC population must then have contributed to approximately 5-8%\n(10-20%) of the low-mass stars in the Galactic halo.

These observations appear to rule out a power-law GCIMF, whereas they\nare compatible with a log-normal one. Finally, the high initial masses also\nimply that GCs must have emitted a large amount of ionising photons in the\nearly Universe.

In this approach, we define a coordination sphere,\nthe inner-shell, and separate the excess chemical potential into packing,\nouter-shell, and local chemical contributions; the coordination state is\ndefined by the number of solvent water molecules within the coordination\nsphere. The packing term accounts for the free energy of creating a solute-free\ncoordination sphere in the liquid. The outer-shell term accounts for the\ninteraction of the solute with the fluid outside the coordination sphere and it\nis accurately described by a Gaussian model of hydration for coordination radii\ngreater than the minimum of the oxygen-oxygen pair correlation function.\nConsistent with the conventional radial cut-off used for defining\nhydrogen-bonds in liquid water, theory helps identify a chemically meaningful\ncoordination radius. The local chemical contribution is recast as a sum over\ncoordination states. The n-th term in this sum is given by the probability of\nobserving n water molecules inside the coordination sphere in the absence of\nthe solute water times a factor accounting for the interaction of the solute\nwith the inner-shell solvent water molecules.

We find that for all but one burst in our sample the offsets are\nconsistent with this model. For the case of bursts with massive elliptical host\ngalaxies, the circular velocities of the hosts' haloes exceed the natal\nvelocities of almost all our compact object binaries. Hence the extents of the\npredicted offset distributions for elliptical galaxies are determined largely\nby their spatial extents. In contrast, for spiral hosts the galactic rotation\nvelocities are smaller than typical binary natal velocities and the predicted\nburst offset distributions are more extended than the galaxies.\n  One SGRB, 060502B, apparently has a large radial offset that is inconsistent\nwith an origin in a merging galactic compact binary. Although it is plausible\nthat the host of GRB 060502B is mis-identified, our results show that the large\noffset is compatible with a scenario where at least a few per cent of SGRBs are\ncreated by the merger of compact binaries that form dynamically in globular\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 21:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Such variations would demonstrate a local dust evolution linked to\nvariation of the environment parameters such as the density or the interstellar\nradiation field. The extinction values, A_lambda/A_V, are obtained using the\n2MASS, UKIDSS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE surveys. The technique is to inter-calibrate\ncolor-excess maps from different wavelengths to derive the extinction law and\nto map the extinction in the Trifid region. We measured the extinction law at\n3.6, 4.5, and 5.8 um and we found a transition at A_V ~ 20 mag. Below this\nthreshold the extinction law is as expected from models for R_V=5.5 whereas\nabove 20 mag of visual extinction, it is flatter. Using these results the\ncolor-excess maps are converted into a composite extinction map of the Trifid\nnebula at a spatial resolution of 1 arcmin. A tridimensional analysis along the\nline-of-sight allowed us to estimate a distance of 2.7 kpc for the Trifid. The\ncomparison of the extinction with the 1.25 mm emission suggests the millimeter\nemissivity is enhanced in the dense condensations of the cloud.

This significantly reduces the number of equations necessary to\nmodel such systems. We prove the validity of this approximation using geometric\nsingular perturbation theory and results about matrix differentiation. The\nideas used in deriving the approximating equations are quite general, and can\nbe used to systematize other model reductions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 21:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 01:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Perhaps the most fundamental shape relevant to this question is the\ngraphene nanoribbon (GNR), a narrow strip of graphene that can have different\nchirality depending on the angle at which it is cut. Such GNRs have been\npredicted to exhibit a wide range of behaviour (depending on their chirality\nand width) that includes tunable energy gaps and the presence of unique\none-dimensional (1D) edge states with unusual magnetic structure. Most GNRs\nexplored experimentally up to now have been characterized via electrical\nconductivity, leaving the critical relationship between electronic structure\nand local atomic geometry unclear (especially at edges). Here we present a\nsub-nm-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS)\nstudy of GNRs that allows us to examine how GNR electronic structure depends on\nthe chirality of atomically well-defined GNR edges. The GNRs used here were\nchemically synthesized via carbon nanotube (CNT) unzipping methods that allow\nflexible variation of GNR width, length, chirality, and substrate. Our STS\nmeasurements reveal the presence of 1D GNR edge states whose spatial\ncharacteristics closely match theoretical expectations for GNR's of similar\nwidth and chirality. We observe width-dependent splitting in the GNR edge state\nenergy bands, providing compelling evidence of their magnetic nature.

Moreover,\nit might happen that the observed data are either truncated below a given\nthreshold and/or might not be reliable enough below that threshold because of\nthe recording devices. These situations occur, in particular, with radio\naudience data measured using personal meters that record environmental noise\nevery minute, that is then matched to one of the several radio programs. There\nare therefore genuine zeros for respondents not listening to the radio, but\nalso zeros corresponding to real listeners for whom the match between the\nrecorded noise and the radio program could not be achieved. Since radio\naudiences are important for radio broadcasters in order, for example, to\ndetermine advertisement price policies, possibly according to the type of\naudience at different time points, it is essential to be able to explain not\nonly the probability of listening to a radio but also the average time spent\nlistening to the radio by means of the characteristics of the listeners. In\nthis paper we propose a generalized linear model for zero-inflated truncated\nPareto distribution (ZITPo) that we use to fit audience radio data. Because it\nis based on the generalized Pareto distribution, the ZITPo model has nice\nproperties such as model invariance to the choice of the threshold and from\nwhich a natural residual measure can be derived to assess the model fit to the\ndata. From a general formulation of the most popular models for zero-inflated\ndata, we derive our model by considering successively the truncated case, the\ngeneralized Pareto distribution and then the inclusion of covariates to explain\nthe nonzero proportion of listeners and their average listening time. By means\nof simulations, we study the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator\n(and derived inference) and use the model to fully analyze the audience data of\na radio station in a certain area of Switzerland.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 08:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-07"}

The influence of magnetic fields on stellar core collapse and\nexplosion is not well explored. It depends on the possibility to amplify the\npre-collapse fields. Without rotation this can happen by compression,\nconvection, the standing accretion shock instability, and the accumulation and\ngrowth of Alfven waves in the accretion flows.\n  Aims. We investigate such amplification mechanisms of the magnetic field\nduring the collapse and post-bounce evolution of the core of a non-rotating 15\nsolar mass star with varied initial field strengths, taking into account the\nmicrophysical equation of state and neutrino physics crucial for supernova\ncores.\n  Methods. We perform simulations of ideal MHD with neutrino transport in\naxisymmetry. The transport of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos is treated\nwith a new scheme that solves the energy-dependent set of radiation energy and\nmomentum equations in 2d by using an analytic closure relation.\n  Results. The magnetic field undergoes amplification by turbulent flows. We\nfind indications for amplification by interacting waves in accretion streams.\nThe fields can reach up to equipartition with the velocity field. Very high\nmagnetic field strengths require very strong pre-collapse fields and are able\nto shape the post-bounce flow, leading to a pattern dominated by low-order\nmultipoles. Such models are closest to a successful explosion.\n  Conclusions. Magnetic fields can build up to interesting strengths even in\nnon-rotating collapsing stellar cores. Starting with fields in the pre-collapse\ncore as predicted by present stellar evolution models, typical neutron star\nfields emerge, whereas stronger progenitor fields lead to fields of magnetar\nstrength. Only in the latter case the fields have dynamical effects on the\nflows in the supernova core. However, in none of our 2D simulations, we find an\nexplosion until 500 ms post-bounce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 12:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

For $\\alpha$ Cen A and B, however, it is not possible to fit\nmodels with the same age and chemical composition to all seismic and\nnon-seismic observational constraints.

These correlations were initially thought\nto be universal. However, recently many sources have been found to produce jets\nthat, given certain accretion-powered luminosities, are fainter than expected\nfrom the earlier correlations. This shows that black holes with similar\naccretion flows can produce a broad range of outflows in power, suggesting that\nsome other parameters might be tuning the accretion/ejection coupling.

The ages of binaries,\nmembers of open clusters, are constrained by their own fundamental properties\nand by those of the hosting cluster. The ages of eleven open clusters are here\nfound by constructing models for the components of twelve eclipsing binaries.\nThe difference between the ages we found and the ages of the clusters derived\nfrom isochrone fitting is up to 40%. For the binary system V497 Cep in NGC\n7160, the difference is about 100%. Binary systems whose primary component is\naboutto complete main-sequence life time, such as V453 Cyg and V906 Sco, are\nthe most suitable systems for age determination. Using model results for these\nstars, we derive an expression for sensitive and uncomplicated relative age\ndetermination of binary systems (age divided by the main-sequence life time of\nthe primary star). The expression is given as logarithm of radii ratio divided\nby a logarithm of mass ratio. Two advantages of this expression are that (i) it\nis nearly independent of assumed chemical composition of the models because of\nthe appearance of the ratio of radii, and (ii) the ratios of radii and masses\nare observationally much more precise than their absolute values. We also\nderive another expression using luminosities rather than radii and compare\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 14:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Above a critical interaction strength V_c a charge-density wave\nwith a broken Z_3 symmetry is stabilized. Using the unrestricted mean-field\napproximation, we present several arguments showing that elementary topological\npoint defects in the order parameter bind a fractional charge. Our analysis\nmakes use of two appealing properties of the model: (i) For weak interaction,\nthe low-energy degrees of freedom are described by Dirac fermions coupled to a\ncomplex-valued mass field (order parameter). (ii) The nearest-neighbor\ninteraction is geometrically frustrated at filling f=1/3. Both properties offer\na route to fractionalization and yield a consistent value 1/2 for the\nfractional charge as long as the symmetry between the up and the down triangles\nof the kagome lattice is preserved. If this symmetry is violated, the value of\nthe bound charge varies continuously with the strength of the symmetry-breaking\nterm in the model. In addition, we have numerically computed the confining\npotential between two fractionally charged defects. We find that it grows\nlinearly at large distances but can show a minimum at a finite separation for\nintermediate interactions. This indicates that the polaron state, formed upon\ndoping the charge-density wave, can be viewed as a bound state of two defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 15:45:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 15:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Taking a network calculus approach, we\nconsider both deterministic and statistical performance metrics.

The deterministic\nversions of our bounds yield optimal bounds on end-to-end backlog and output\nburstiness for some schedulers, and are highly accurate for end-to-end delay\nbounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 15:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-07"}

Several variations are apparent during this\ninterval. The optical shows a superhump modulation in the months following\noutburst while a 19 min quasi-periodic modulation lasting for several months is\napparent in the year after outburst. A long timescale (about 4 hr) modulation\nfirst appears in the UV a year after outburst and increases in amplitude in the\nfollowing years. This variation also appears in the optical 2 years after\noutburst but is not in phase with the UV. The pre-outburst pulsations are not\nyet visible after 3 years, likely indicating the white dwarf has not returned\nto its quiescent state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 15:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Various modifications to the EDF and FCFS\npolicies have been proposed in the literature, with a view to improving\nperformance. In this article, we compare the loss ratios of these two policies\nalong with some of the said modifications, as well as their counterparts with\ndeterministic deadlines. The results include some formal inequalities and some\ncounter-examples to establish non-existence of an order. A few relations\ninvolving loss ratios are posed as conjectures, and simulation results in\nsupport of these are reported. These results lead to a complete picture of\ndominance and non-dominance relations between pairs of scheduling policies, in\nterms of loss ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 10:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We find that these giants cells have a lifetime larger\nthan the stellar period with a typical longitudinal width of 490 Mm and a\nlatitudinal extension increasing with the radial density contrast overpassing\n50\\degree of latitude for the thickest convective zone. Their rotation rate is\nmuch larger than the local differential rotation rate increasing also with the\nradial density contrast. However, their spatial coherence as a function of\ndepth decrease with the density contrast due to the stronger shear present in\nthese more stratified cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 01:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
