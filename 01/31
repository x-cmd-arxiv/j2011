SCS based on Gaussian models is investigated in depth.\nFor signals that follow a single Gaussian model, with Gaussian or Bernoulli\nsensing matrices of O(k) measurements, considerably smaller than the O(k\nlog(N/k)) required by conventional CS based on sparse models, where N is the\nsignal dimension, and with an optimal decoder implemented via linear filtering,\nsignificantly faster than the pursuit decoders applied in conventional CS, the\nerror of SCS is shown tightly upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term\napproximation error, with overwhelming probability. The failure probability is\nalso significantly smaller than that of conventional sparsity-oriented CS.\nStronger yet simpler results further show that for any sensing matrix, the\nerror of Gaussian SCS is upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term\napproximation with probability one, and the bound constant can be efficiently\ncalculated. For Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), that assume multiple Gaussian\ndistributions and that each signal follows one of them with an unknown index, a\npiecewise linear estimator is introduced to decode SCS. The accuracy of model\nselection, at the heart of the piecewise linear decoder, is analyzed in terms\nof the properties of the Gaussian distributions and the number of sensing\nmeasurements. A maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization algorithm that\niteratively estimates the Gaussian models parameters, the signals model\nselection, and decodes the signals, is presented for GMM-based SCS. In real\nimage sensing applications, GMM-based SCS is shown to lead to improved results\ncompared to conventional CS, at a considerably lower computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2011 17:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Determining the structure of the source intensity\ndistribution also requires a description of the blurring effect due to a point\nspread function. This initial study uses an iterative gravitational lens\nmodeling scheme based on the semilinear method to determine the linear\nparameters (source intensity profile) of a strongly lensed system. Our\n'matrix-free' approach avoids construction of the lens and blurring operators\nwhile retaining the least squares formulation of the problem. The parameters of\nan analytical lens model are found through nonlinear optimization by an\nadvanced genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimizer (PSO). These\nglobal optimization routines are designed to explore the parameter space\nthoroughly, mapping model degeneracies in detail. We develop a novel method\nthat determines the L-curve for each solution automatically, which represents\nthe trade-off between the image chi-square and regularization effects, and\nallows an estimate of the optimally regularized solution for each lens\nparameter set. In the final step of the optimization procedure, the lens model\nwith the lowest chi-square is used while the global optimizer solves for the\nsource intensity distribution directly. This allows us to accurately determine\nthe number of degrees of freedom in the problem to facilitate comparison\nbetween lens models and enforce positivity on the source profile.

The incorporation of those variables makes it possible to provide\nan objective description of nature in which rather ambiguous notions such as\n`measurement' and `observer' play no fundamental role.

Our model radii are drawn from previously published\ncalculations of core-less giant planets that have attained their asymptotic\nradii, and which have been tabulated for a range of planet masses and\nequilibrium temperatures. (We report a two-dimensional polynomial fitting\nfunction that accurately represents the models). As expected, the model radii\nprovide a statistically significant improvement over a null hypothesis that the\nsizes of giant planets are completely independent of mass and effective\ntemperature. As is well known, however, fiducial models provide an insufficient\nexplanation; the planetary radius anomalies are strongly correlated with\nplanetary equilibrium temperature. We find that the radius anomalies have a\nbest-fit dependence, ${\\cal R}\\propto T_{\\rm eff}^{\\alpha}$, with\n$\\alpha=1.4\\pm0.6$. Incorporating this relation into the model radii leads to\nsubstantially less scatter in the radius correlation. The extra temperature\ndependence represents an important constraint on theoretical models for Hot\nJupiters. Using simple scaling arguments, we find support for the hypothesis of\nBatygin and Stevenson (2010) that this correlation can be attributed to a\nplanetary heating mechanism that is mediated by magnetohydrodynamic coupling\nbetween the planetary magnetic field and near-surface flow that is accompanied\nby ohmic dissipation at adiabatic depth. Additionally, we find that the\ntemperature dependence is likely too strong to admit kinetic heating as the\nprimary source of anomalous energy generation within the majority of the\nobserved transiting planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2011 22:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

These three different populations correspond to evolved\nphases of Main Sequence (MS) OB stars. Axial rotation and mass loss have a\ngreat influence on massive star evolution in general and more specifically on\nthe durations of these different phases. Moderate rotation and mass loss,\nduring the MS phase, favor the evolution towards the RSG stage. Fast rotation\nand strong mass loss during the MS phase, in contrast, prevent the star from\nbecoming a RSG and allow the star to pass directly from the OB star phase into\nthe WR phase. Mass loss during the RSG stage may make the star evolve back in\nthe blue part of the HR diagram. We argue that such an evolution may be more\ncommon than presently accounted for in stellar models. This might be the reason\nfor the lack of type IIP SNe with RSG progenitors having initial masses between\n18 and 30 M$_\\odot$. The LBVs do appear as a possible transition phase between\nO and WR stars or between WNL and WNE stars.

On the other\nhand, we show that, for k>=3, determining the minimum number of moves required\nto flood a k x n board coloured with at least four colours remains NP-hard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 08:42:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 11:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 18:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Both can account for\nthe PAMELA and Fermi-LAT excesses of e^\\pm. For GUT decaying dark matter, the\ngamma-rays from the M49 and Fornax clusters, with energy in the range of 1 to\n10 GeV, lead to the most stringent constraints to date. As a result, this dark\nmatter is disfavored with conventional model of e^\\pm background. In addition,\nit is likely that some tension exists between the Fermi-LAT e^\\pm excess and\nthe gamma ray constraints for any decaying dark matter model, provided\nconventional model of e^\\pm background is adopted. Nevertheless, the GUT\ndecaying dark matter can still solely account for the PAMELA positron fraction\nexcess without violating the gamma-ray constraints.

This is because a different e^\\pm background has been adopted\nwhich leads to relatively light dark matter mass around 200 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 09:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 04:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

The\nexpected signature of a stochastic process plays a similar role to that played\nby the characteristic function of a random variable. In [Chevyrev (2013)], it\nis proved that under certain boundedness conditions, the expected value of a\nrandom signature already determines the law of this random signature.

The X-ray spectrum is found to be concave indicating the transition\nregion between the low and high energy component of the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED). VLBA observation detected a synchrotron spectrum\nself-absorption turnover in the innermost part of the radio jet appearing to be\nelongated and inhomogeneous, and constrained the average magnetic field there\nto be less than 3 G.

Several authors have proposed various answers to these\nquestions and offered a variety of different expressions for the relevant\noperators. I argue that none of these is acceptable and suggest that the\ncanonical expression for the momentum and angular momentum operators is the\ncorrect and physically meaningful one. It is then an inescapable fact that the\ngluon angular momentum operator cannot, in general, be split in a gauge\ninvariant way into a spin and orbital part. However, the projection of the\ngluon spin onto its direction of motion i.e. its helicity is gauge invariant\nand is measured in deep inelastic scattering on nucleons.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be an\nideal instrument for measuring the parallax of pulsars, because it has a very\nhigh sensitivity, as well as baselines extending up to several thousands of\nkilometres. We performed simulations to estimate the number of pulsars for\nwhich the parallax can be measured with the SKA and the distance to which a\nparallax can be measured. We compare two different methods. The first method\nmeasures the parallax directly by utilising the long baselines of the SKA to\nform high angular resolution images.

A flow equation equates the\nmonotonicity properties of $\\mathcal N$ with the gravitational field, which has\nopposite signs in the domain-wall and black hole backgrounds, due to the\npresence of negative/positive energy in the former/latter, and accordingly\n$\\mathcal N$ monotonically decreases/increases from the UV to the IR. On $AdS$\nspaces the $\\mathcal N$-function is related to the Euler anomaly, and at a\nblack hole horizon it is generically proportional to the entropy. For planar\nblack holes, $\\mathcal N$ diverges at the horizon, which we interpret as an\norder $N^2$ increase in the number of effective degrees of freedom. We show how\n$\\mathcal N$ can be written as the ratio of the Wald entropy to an effective\nphase space volume, and using the flow equation relate this to Verlinde's\nnotion of gravity as an entropic force. From the effective phase space we can\nobtain an expression for the dual field theory momentum cut-off, matching a\nprevious proposal in the literature by Polchinski and Heemskerk. Finally, we\npropose that the area in Planck units counts states, not degrees of freedom,\nand identify it also as a phase space volume. Written in terms of the proper\nradial distance $\\beta$, it takes the suggestive form of a canonical partition\nfunction at inverse temperature $\\beta$, leading to a \"mean energy\" which is\nsimply the extrinsic curvature of the surface. Using this we relate this\ndefinition of holographic phase space with the effective phase space appearing\nin the $\\mathcal N$-function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 15:35:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 11:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The variance decay rate, scalar field\nstructure, and time evolution of statistical moments confirm that there are two\ndistinct regimes of scalar decay: a locally controlled regime, which applies\nwhen the domain size is comparable to the characteristic lengthscale of the\nvelocity field, and a globally controlled regime, which when applies when the\ndomain is larger.

The outer set spans ~7.5 kpc and is expanding into\nthe halo regions of the host galaxy. We present an analysis of our new Chandra\nobservation, together with archival XMM-Newton data, to look for evidence of\nemission from shocked gas around the external radio bubbles, both from\nspatially resolved regions in Chandra and from spectral analysis of the XMM\ndata. We also look for evidence of a variable absorbing column along our line\nof sight to Mrk 6, to explain the evident differences seen in the AGN spectra\nfrom the various, non-contemporaneous, observations.\n  We find that the variable absorption hypothesis explains the differences\nbetween the Chandra and XMM spectra, with the Chandra spectrum being heavily\nabsorbed. The intrinsic N_H varies from ~8x10^{21} atoms*cm^{-2} to ~3x10^{23}\natoms*cm^{-2} on short timescales (2-6 years). The past evolution of the source\nsuggests this is probably caused by a clump of gas close to the central AGN,\npassing in front of us at the moment of the observation. Shells of thermal\nX-ray emission are detected around the radio bubbles, with a temperature of\n~0.9 keV. We estimate a temperature of ~0.2 keV for the external medium using\nluminosity constraints from our Chandra image. We analyse these results using\nthe Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump conditions, and obtain a Mach number of ~3.9,\ncompatible with a scenario in which the gas in the shells is inducing a strong\nshock in the surrounding ISM. This could be the third clear detection of strong\nshocks produced by a radio-powerful Seyfert galaxy.

In spite of a common\npresumption that cosmology is a natural science, the specificity of its alleged\nsubject matter, that is the universe as a whole, makes cosmology fundamentally\ndifferent from other natural sciences. The reason is that in cosmology the\nsubject of cosmological research and its \"object\" are in a certain sense\ninseparable. Any study of the universe involves two opposite perspectives which\ncan be described as \"a-cosmic\" and \"cosmic\", egocentric and non-egocentric.\nCosmology involves two languages, namely that of physical causality (pertaining\nto the natural sciences) and that of intentionality (pertaining to the human\nsciences). On the one hand the universe can be seen as a product of discursive\nreason, that is as an abstract \"physical\" entity unfolding in space and time.\nOn the other hand the universe can be experienced through our participation in,\nor communion with the world understood as the natural context of living beings.\nThis dichotomy between reason and experience, abstract construction and\nconcrete participation, originates in the essence of human persons understood\nas unities of the corporeal and spiritual. On account of this dichotomy it is\nhard to set up a strict line of demarcation between the elements of the human\nand the natural sciences in cosmology. This confirms the intuition that any\nrealistic world view is incomplete without a knowledge of what it means to\nexist as a human being. Conversely it is likewise impossible to understand\nhuman existence without considering its natural setting, that is the universe.\nWe conclude that anthropology is incomplete without cosmology and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 14:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-16"}
