In particular, inelastic collisions can be assumed as an\nefficient mechanism to suppress Fermi acceleration of the particle. The\ndissipation also creates attractors in the system, including chaotic. We show\nthat a slightly modification of the intensity of the damping coefficient yields\na drastic and sudden destruction of the chaotic attractor, thus leading the\nsystem to experience a boundary crisis. We have characterized such a boundary\ncrisis via a collision of the chaotic attractor with its own basin of\nattraction and confirmed that inelastic collisions do indeed suppress Fermi\nacceleration in two-dimensional time dependent billiards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 17:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-25"}

The spread of the rumor is governed by a\ndynamic communication graph process ${G_t(r) | t \\geq 0}$, where two agents are\nconnected by an edge in $G_t(r)$ iff their distance at time $t$ is within their\ntransmission radius $r$.

These properties are much stronger\nthan separability, but are equivalent to it in the presence of certain\nconvergence properties. For example, we show that every Hausdorff separable\nradial space is R-separable and note that neither separable sequential nor\nseparable Whyburn spaces have to be selectively separable. A space is called\n\\emph{d-separable} if it has a dense $\\sigma$-discrete subspace.

The magnetic field\nstrength in dwarf galaxies does not correlate with their maximum rotational\nvelocity, indicating a small-scale rather than a large-scale dynamo process. If\nmagnetization of the Universe by galactic outflows is coeval with its metal\nenrichment, we show that more massive objects (such as Lyman Break Galaxies)\ncan efficiently magnetize the intergalactic medium with a magnetic field\nstrength of about 0.8nG out to a distance of 160-530kpc at redshifts 5-3,\nrespectively. Several times weaker fields and shorter magnetization distances\nare expected from primordial dwarf galaxies. We also predict that most\nstar-forming local dwarfs might have magnetized their surroundings up to about\n0.1muG within about 5kpc distance. Strong magnetic fields (>6muG) are observed\nonly in dwarfs of extreme characteristics while typical LG dwarfs are\nunsuitable objects for the efficient supply of magnetic fields to the\nintergalactic medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 08:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The IYJ excess\ncorrelates with the excess in the V band, attributed to accretion shocks in the\nphotosphere, and the excess in the K band, attributed to dust in the inner disk\nnear the dust sublimation radius, but it is too large to be an extension of the\nexcess from these sources. The spectrum of the excess emission is broad and\nfeatureless, suggestive of blackbody radiation with a temperature between 2200\nand 5000 K. The luminosity of the IYJ excess is comparable to the accretion\nluminosity inferred from modeling the blue and ultraviolet excess emission and\nmay require reassessment of disk accretion rates. The source of the IYJ excess\nis unclear. In stars of low accretion rate, the size of the emitting region is\nconsistent with cooler material surrounding small hot accretion spots in the\nphotosphere. However, for stars with high accretion rates, the projected area\nis comparable to or exceeds that of the stellar surface.

In the past decade,\ncompelling evidence has emerged that suggests Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) may\nbe precursors to stellar clusters. However, the usual method for identifying\nIRDCs is biased by the requirement that they are seen in absorption against\nbright mid-IR emission, whereas dust continuum observations allow cold, dense\npre-stellar-clusters to be identified anywhere. Aims: We aim to understand what\nphysical properties characterize IRDCs, to explore the population of dust\ncontinuum sources that are not IRDCs, and to roughly characterize the star\nformation activity in dust continuum sources. Results: We present temperature\nand column density maps in the Hi-GAL l=30 and l=59 SDP fields, as well as a\nrobust algorithm for cirrus subtraction and source identification using Hi-GAL.\nWe report on the fraction of Hi-GAL sources which are mid-IR-dark, -neutral, or\n-bright in both fields. We find significant trends in column density and\ntemperature between mid-IR-dark and -bright pixels; mid-IR-dark pixels are\nabout 10 K colder and have a factor of 2 higher column density on average than\nmid-IR-bright pixels. We find that Hi-GAL dust continuum sources span a range\nof evolutionary states from pre- to star-forming, and that warmer sources are\nassociated with more star formation tracers. There is a trend of increasing\ntemperature with tracer type from mid-IR-dark at the coldest, to outflow/maser\nsources in the middle, and finally to 8 and 24 micron bright sources at the\nwarmest. Finally, we identify five candidate IRDC-like sources on the far-side\nof the Galaxy.

The problem\nof sweeping points by orthogonal sweeps was first studied in [2]. Here we\nconsider the following \\emph{slanted} variant of sweeping recently introduced\nin [1]: In a single sweep, the sweep-line is placed at a start position\nsomewhere in the plane, then moved continuously according to a sweep vector\n$\\vec v$ (not necessarily orthogonal to the sweep-line) to another parallel end\nposition, and then lifted from the plane. The cost of a sequence of sweeps is\nthe sum of the lengths of the sweep vectors. The (optimal) sweeping cost of a\nregion is the infimum of the costs over all finite sweeping sequences for that\nregion. An optimal sweeping sequence for a region is one with a minimum total\ncost, if it exists. Another parameter of interest is the number of sweeps.\n  We show that there exist convex regions for which the optimal sweeping cost\ncannot be attained by two sweeps. This disproves a conjecture of Bousany,\nKarker, O'Rourke, and Sparaco stating that two sweeps (with vectors along the\ntwo adjacent sides of a minimum-perimeter enclosing parallelogram) always\nsuffice [1]. Moreover, we conjecture that for some convex regions, no finite\nsweeping sequence is optimal. On the other hand, we show that both the 2-sweep\nalgorithm based on minimum-perimeter enclosing rectangle and the 2-sweep\nalgorithm based on minimum-perimeter enclosing parallelogram achieve a $4/\\pi\n\\approx 1.27$ approximation in this sweeping model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 21:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Customer demand arrives according to a\nPoisson process, the rate of which is influenced by a single action taken by\nthe retailer (such as price adjustment, sales commission, advertisement\nintensity, etc.). The relationship between the action and the demand rate is\nnot known in advance. However, the retailer is able to learn the optimal action\n\"on the fly\" as she maximizes her total expected revenue based on the observed\ndemand reactions.\n  Using the pricing problem as an example, we propose a dynamic\n\"learning-while-doing\" algorithm that only involves function value estimation\nto achieve a near-optimal performance. Our algorithm employs a series of\nshrinking price intervals and iteratively tests prices within that interval\nusing a set of carefully chosen parameters. We prove that the convergence rate\nof our algorithm is among the fastest of all possible algorithms in terms of\nasymptotic \"regret\" (the relative loss comparing to the full information\noptimal solution).

We close by discussing the implications\nof these results for the physics of the iron pnictides and chalcogenides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 02:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Decoherence of a quantum superposition state arises from the\ninteraction between the constituent system and the uncontrolled degrees of\nfreedom in its environment. Within the standard Bloch-Redfield picture of\ntwo-level system dynamics, qubit decoherence is characterized by two rates: a\nlongitudinal relaxation rate Gamma1 due to the exchange of energy with the\nenvironment, and a transverse relaxation rate Gamma2 = Gamma1/2 + Gamma_phi\nwhich contains the pure dephasing rate Gamma_phi. Irreversible energy\nrelaxation can only be mitigated by reducing the amount of environmental noise,\nreducing the qubit's internal sensitivity to that noise, or through multi-qubit\nencoding and error correction protocols (which already presume ultra-low error\nrates). In contrast, dephasing is in principle reversible and can be refocused\ndynamically through the application of coherent control pulse methods. In this\nwork we demonstrate how dynamical-decoupling techniques can moderate the\ndephasing effects of low-frequency noise on a superconducting qubit with\nenergy-relaxation time T1 = 1/Gamma1 = 12 us. Using the CPMG sequence with up\nto 200 pi-pulses, we demonstrate a 50-fold improvement in the transverse\nrelaxation time T2 over its baseline value. We observe relaxation-limited times\nT2(CPMG) = 23 us = 2 T1 resulting from CPMG-mediated Gaussian pure-dephasing\ntimes in apparent excess of 100 us. We leverage the filtering property of this\nsequence in conjunction with Rabi and energy relaxation measurements to\nfacilitate the spectroscopy and reconstruction of the environmental noise power\nspectral density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 03:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-15"}

We show that this gives us a native graphical language for the design\nand analysis of topological quantum algorithms, and finish by discussing the\npossibilities for automating this process on a large scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 05:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 14:58:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 16:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

Benade proposed a practical definition using the measurement\nof the input impedance, for which at least two frequency bands appear. The\nfirst one is a stop band, while the second one is a pass band. The value of\nthis frequency, which is a global quantity, depends on the whole geometry of\nthe instrument, but is rather independent of the fingering. This seems to\njustify the consideration of a woodwind with several open holes as a periodic\nlattice. However the holes on a clarinet are very irregular. The paper\ninvestigates the question of the acoustical regularity: an acoustically regular\nlattice of tone holes is defined as a lattice built with T-shaped cells of\nequal eigenfrequencies. Then the paper discusses the possibility of division of\na real lattice into cells of equal eigenfrequencies. It is shown that it is not\nstraightforward but possible, explaining the apparent paradox of Benade's\ntheory. When considering the open holes from the input of the instrument to its\noutput, the spacings between holes are enlarged together with their radii: this\nexplains the relative constancy of the eigenfrequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 08:08:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 09:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-19"}

A novel method is employed, which divides the feasible set\ninto two subsets and establishes the optimum from one of them by comparison.

While the theoretical estimates of the neutrino fluxes contain large\nuncertainties, we can formulate the conditions for the detectability of certain\nneutrino sources phenomenologically. In fact, since most galactic neutrino\nsources are transparent for TeV gamma-rays, their detectability implies a\nminimum flux of the accompanying gamma-rays. For a typical energy-dependence of\ndetection areas of km**3 volume neutrino detectors, we obtain the quantitative\ncondition I_gamma(20 TeV)>2*10^-15 ph/(cm**2 s), that thanks to the\nnormalization of the gamma-ray spectrum at 20 TeV appears to be quite robust,\ni.e. almost independent of the shape of energy spectrum of neutrinos. We remark\nthat this condition is satisfied by the young supernova remnants RX\nJ1713.7-3946 and RX J0852.0-4622 (Vela Jr) - two of the strongest galactic\ngamma-ray sources. The preliminary condition for the detectability of high\nenergy neutrinos is that the bulk of gamma-rays has a hadronic origin: A new\nway to test this hypothesis for RX J1713.7-3946 is proposed. Finally, we assess\nthe relevance of a neutrino detector located in the Northern Hemisphere for the\nsearch for galactic neutrino sources. In particular, we argue that if the TeV\nneutrino sources correlate with the galactic mass distribution, the probability\nthat some of them will be observed by a detector in the Mediterranean Sea is\nlarger by a factor of 1.4-2.9 compared to the one of IceCube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 15:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-28"}

Then, using a 2.5-D electromagnetic particle-in-cell\nmodel with free boundary conditions, these processes were modelled on the\nkinetic level of plasma description. We recognized the plasmoids which mutually\ninteracted and finally merged into one large plasmoid. Between interacting\nplasmoids further plasmoids and current sheets on smaller and smaller spatial\nscales were formed in agreement with the fragmentation found in MHD\nsimulations. During interactions (merging - coalescences) of the plasmoids the\nelectrons were very efficiently accelerated and heated.

Non stationary reciprocal processes have been extensively studied in\nthe past especially by Jamison, Krener, Levy and co-workers. The specialization\nof the non-stationary theory to the stationary case, however, does not seem to\nhave been pursued in sufficient depth in the literature. Stationary reciprocal\nprocesses (and reciprocal stochastic models) are potentially useful for\ndescribing signals which naturally live in a finite region of the time (or\nspace) line. Estimation or identification of these models starting from\nobserved data seems still to be an open problem which can lead to many\ninteresting applications in signal and image processing. In this paper, we\ndiscuss a class of reciprocal processes which is the acausal analog of\nauto-regressive (AR) processes, familiar in control and signal processing. We\nshow that maximum likelihood identification of these processes leads to a\ncovariance extension problem for block-circulant covariance matrices. This\ngeneralizes the famous covariance band extension problem for stationary\nprocesses on the integer line. As in the usual stationary setting on the\ninteger line, the covariance extension problem turns out to be a basic\nconceptual and practical step in solving the identification problem.
