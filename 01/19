We model their evolution using the\nhydrodynamic FLASH code, which uses adaptive mesh refinement. We show that the\npeculiar morphology of the entire nebula can be reproduced to a good\napproximation, due to the combined effects of: (i) the evolution of the SNR\nshell from the free-expansion phase through the Sedov blast wave in an\nexponential density profile from the Milky Way disc, and (ii) the subsequent\ninteraction of the relativistic, precessing jets of SS 433. Our simulations\nreveal: (1) Independent measurement of the Galaxy scale-height and density\nlocal to SS433 (as n_0 = 0.2 cm^{-3}, Z_d = 40 pc), with this scale-height\nbeing in excellent agreement with the work of Dehnen & Binney.

Implementing expected improvement requires a choice\nof Gaussian process prior, which determines an associated space of functions,\nits reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).

This pipeline has been programmed in IDL and automates the\nprocess of data reduction. It can operate in two modes: automatic data\nreduction (quicklook) or semi-automatic data reduction (full). In \"quicklook\",\nwe are able to get rectified and calibrated spectra of all stars of a full\nnight just minutes after the observations. The pipeline automatically\nidentifies the type of image and applies the standard reduction procedure (bias\nsubtraction, flat field correction, application of bad pixel mask, ...). It\nalso extracts all spectra of the stars in one image (including close visual\nbinaries), aligns and merges all spectra of the same star (to increase the\nsignal to noise ratio and to correct defects such as cosmic rays), calibrates\nin wavelength and rectifies the continuum. The same operations are performed in\nfull mode, but allowing the user to adjust the parameters used in the process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 17:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-19"}

Contrary to the\n1D result -where the sunward dynamic is independent of the magnetic field\nintensity due to its exclusively waveguide role- in the 2D simulation the\nsunward speed is larger for larger values of the magnetic field.

We construct\nlocal photon escape cones for a variety of orbiting sources that enable to\ndetermine the superspinars silhouette in the case of distant observers. We show\nthat the superspinar silhouette depends strongly on the assumed edge where the\nexternal Kerr spacetime is joined to the internal spacetime governed by the\nstring theory and significantly differs from the black hole silhouette. The\nappearance of the accretion disc is strongly dependent on the value of the\nsuperspinar spin in both their shape and frequency shift profile. Apparent\nextension of the disc grows significantly with growing spin, while the\nfrequency shift grows with descending spin. This behavior differs substantially\nfrom appearance of discs orbiting black holes enabling thus, at least in\nprinciple, to distinguish clearly the Kerr superspinars and black holes. In\nvicinity of a Kerr superspinar the non-escaped photons have to be separated to\nthose captured by the superspinar and those being trapped in its strong\ngravitational field leading to self-illumination of the disc that could even\ninfluence its structure and causes self-reflection effect of radiation of the\ndisc.

Previous work has demonstrated that the black hole\nspins can have a strong impact on the accuracy of parameter measurement.\nRelativistic spin-induced precession modulates the waveform in a manner which\ncan break degeneracies between parameters, in principle significantly improving\nhow well they are measured. Recent studies have indicated, however, that spin\nprecession may be weak for an important subset of astrophysical binary black\nholes: those in which the spins are aligned due to interactions with gas. In\nthis paper, we examine how well a binary's parameters can be measured when its\nspins are partially aligned and compare results using waveforms that include\nhigher post-Newtonian harmonics to those that are truncated at leading\nquadrupole order. We find that the weakened precession can substantially\ndegrade parameter estimation. This degradation is particularly devastating for\nthe extrinsic parameters sky position and distance. Absent higher harmonics,\nLISA typically localizes the sky position of a nearly aligned binary a factor\nof $\\sim 6$ less accurately than for one in which the spin orientations are\nrandom. Our knowledge of a source's sky position will thus be worst for the\ngas-rich systems which are most likely to produce electromagnetic counterparts.\nFortunately, higher harmonics of the waveform can make up for this degradation.\nBy including harmonics beyond the quadrupole in our waveform model, we find\nthat the accuracy with which most of the binary's parameters are measured can\nbe substantially improved. In some cases, parameters can be measured as well in\npartially aligned binaries as they can be when the binary spins are random.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 00:29:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 02:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In contrast to most previous work, our\nmodels follow stars as they grow from small masses via accretion, and we\nperform a systematic study of how the stars' HRD evolution is influenced by\ntheir initial radius, by the radiative properties of the accretion flow, and by\nthe accretion history, using both simple idealized accretion histories and\nhistories taken from numerical simulations of star cluster formation. We\ncompare our numerical results to both non-accreting isochrones and to the\npositions of observed stars in the HRD, with a goal of determining whether both\nthe absolute ages and the age dispersions inferred from non-accreting\nisochrones are reliable. We show that non-accreting isochrones can sometimes\noverestimate stellar ages for more massive stars (those with effective\ntemperatures above \\sim 3500 K), thereby explaining why non-accreting\nisochrones often suggest a systematic age difference between more and less\nmassive stars in the same cluster. However, we also find the only way to\nproduce a similar overestimate for the ages of cooler stars is by selecting\nparameters that are strongly inconsistent with both theoretical models and\nobservational constraints. We therefore conclude that inferred ages and age\nspreads for cool stars are reliable, at least to the extent that the observed\nbolometric luminosities and temperatures are accurate. Finally, we note that\nthe time-dependence of the mass accretion rate has remarkably little effect on\nlow-mass stars' evolution on the HRD, and that such time-dependence may be\nneglected for all stars except those with effective temperatures above \\sim\n4000 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 02:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 20:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 23:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We found that 115 out of 120 filament\neruptions are associated with flares. 56 out of 105 filament eruptions are\nfound to be associated with CMEs except for 15 events without corresponding\nLASCO data. We note the limitation of coronagraphs duo to geometry or\nsensitivity, leading to many smaller CMEs that are Earth-directed or well out\nof the plane of sky not being detected by near-Earth spacecraft. Excluding\nthose without corresponding LASCO data, the CME association rate of\nactive-region filament eruptions clearly increases with X-ray flare class from\nabout 32% for C-class flares to 100% for X-class flares. The eruptions of\nactive-region filaments associated with Halo CMEs are often accompanied by\nlarge flares. About 92% events associated with X-class flare are associated\nwith Halo CMEs. Such a result is due to that the Earth-directed CMEs detected\nas Halo CMEs are often the larger CMEs and many of the smaller ones are not\ndetected because of the geometry and low intensity. The average speed of the\nassociated CMEs of filament eruptions increases with X-ray flare size from\n563.7 km/s for C-class flares to 1506.6 km/s for X-class flares. Moreover, the\nmagnetic emergence and cancellation play an important role in triggering\nfilament eruptions. These findings may be instructive to not only in respect to\nthe modeling of active-region filament eruptions but also in predicting flares\nand CMEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 06:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

On this occasion, the Radio and Plasma Wave\nScience (RPWS) experiment detected both local and distant radio sources, while\nplasma parameters were measured in situ by the magnetometer (MAG) and the\nCassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS). A goniopolarimetric inversion was applied\nto RPWS 3-antenna electric measurements to determine the wave vector k and the\ncomplete state of polarization of detected waves. We identify broadband\nextraordinary (X) as well as narrowband ordinary (O) mode SKR at low\nfrequencies. Within the source region, SKR is emitted just above the X mode\ncutoff frequency in a hot plasma, with a typical electron-to-wave energy\nconversion efficiency of 1% (2% peak). The knowledge of the k-vector is then\nused to derive the locus of SKR sources in the kronian magnetosphere, that\nshows X and O components emanating from the same regions. We also compute the\nassociated beaming angle at the source theta'=(k,-B) either from (i) in situ\nmeasurements or a model of the magnetic field vector or from (ii) polarization\nmeasurements. Obtained results, similar for both modes, suggest\nquasi-perpendicular emission for local sources, whereas the beaming pattern of\ndistant sources appears as a hollow cone with a frequency-dependent constant\naperture angle: theta'=75{\\deg}+/-15{\\deg} below 300kHz, decreasing at higher\nfrequencies to reach theta'(1000kHz)=50{\\deg}+/-25{\\deg}.

We describe the exact (unimprovable) estimates of the internal and\nexternal radius of the domain of existence of a unique fixed point of the\noperator under consideration and, in addition, we present new apriori and\naposteriori error estimates for successive approximations to the corresponding\nfixed point. Some applications of the new fixed point principle to nonlinear\nintegral operators of different types are given as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 12:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-20"}

Unlike earlier\nimplicit electrostatic PIC approaches (which are based on a linearized\nVlasov-Poisson formulation), ours is based on a nonlinearly converged\nVlasov-Amp\\`ere (VA) model. By iterating particles and fields to a tight\nnonlinear convergence tolerance, the approach features superior stability and\naccuracy properties, avoiding most of the accuracy pitfalls in earlier implicit\nPIC implementations. In particular, the formulation is stable against temporal\n(CFL) and spatial (aliasing) instabilities. It is charge- and energy-conserving\nto numerical roundoff for arbitrary implicit time steps. While momentum is not\nexactly conserved, errors are kept small by an adaptive particle sub-stepping\norbit integrator, which is instrumental to prevent particle tunneling. The VA\nmodel is orbit-averaged along particle orbits to enforce an energy conservation\ntheorem with particle sub-stepping. As a result, very large time steps,\nconstrained only by the dynamical time scale of interest, are possible without\naccuracy loss. Algorithmically, the approach features a Jacobian-free\nNewton-Krylov solver. A main development in this study is the nonlinear\nelimination of the new-time particle variables (positions and velocities). Such\nnonlinear elimination, which we term particle enslavement, results in a\nnonlinear formulation with memory requirements comparable to those of a fluid\ncomputation, and affords us substantial freedom in regards to the particle\norbit integrator. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the\nadvertised properties of the scheme. In particular, long-time ion acoustic wave\nsimulations show that numerical accuracy does not degrade even with very large\nimplicit time steps, and that significant CPU gains are possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 14:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The\ngravitational softening is 5 pc and we allow gas to cool down to \\sim 10 K.\nDuring the first encounter of the collision, a giant filament consists of cold\nand dense gas found between the progenitors by shock compression. A vigorous\nstarburst took place in the filament, resulting in the formation of star\nclusters. The mass of these star clusters ranges from 10^{5-8} Msun. These star\nclusters formed hierarchically: at first small star clusters formed, and then\nthey merged via gravity, resulting in larger star clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 15:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Concerning integral homology 3-spheres, we prove that all\nbut the 3-sphere and the Poincar\\'e 3-sphere admit a taut foliation. Concerning\nnon-integral homology 3-spheres, we prove there are infinitely many which admit\na taut foliation, and infinitely many without taut foliation. Moreover, we show\nthat the geometries do not determine the existence of taut foliations on\nnon-integral Seifert fibered homology 3-spheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 15:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 19:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Partial answers so far available depend on extra assumptions\non the processes, which are usually centered around stationarity. Here we\npresent a general solution for binary-valued hidden Markov processes. Our\napproach is rooted in algebraic statistics hence it is geometric in nature. We\nfind that the algebraic varieties associated with the probability distributions\nof binary-valued hidden Markov processes are zero sets of determinantal\nequations which draws a connection to well-studied objects from algebra. As a\nconsequence, our solution allows for algorithmic implementation based on\nelementary (linear) algebraic routines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 15:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 16:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2011 14:03:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 12:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 11:40:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 15:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}
