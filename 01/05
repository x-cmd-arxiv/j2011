To validate the models with field data, a case study was carried\nout in an industrial company. Furthermore, concepts and measures of complex\nsystems science are analyzed. To evaluate emergent complexity in NPD projects,\nan information-theory measure-termed \"effective measure complexity\" (EMC)- is\nchosen, because it can be derived from first principles and can be calculated\nefficiently.

However, there are two issues to\nconsider: how the results of the analysis depend on the choice of threshold,\nand what role the presence of noise has on a system with respect to a fixed\nthreshold value. We show that while there are principled criteria of keeping\ninformation from the valued graph in the dichotomized version, they produce\nsuch a wide range of binary graphs that only a fraction of the relevant\ninformation will be kept. Additionally, while dichotomization of predictors in\nlinear models has a known asymptotic efficiency loss, the same process applied\nto network edges in a time series model will lead to an efficiency loss that\ngrows larger as the network increases in size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 18:47:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 22:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Robust inference of physical quantities from observations is\ndifficult, because the process depends strongly on geometry and current\nunderstanding of the magnetosphere is not very deep. The polarization of soft\nX-ray photons is an independent source of information, and its magnetospheric\nimprint remains only partially explored. In this paper we calculate how\nresonant cyclotron scattering would modify the observed polarization signal\nrelative to the surface emission, using a multidimensional Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer code that accounts for the gradual coupling of polarization\neigenmodes as photons leave the magnetosphere. We employ a globally-twisted,\nself-similar, force-free magnetosphere with a power-law momentum distribution,\nassume a blackbody spectrum for the seed photons, account for general\nrelativistic light deflection close to the star, and assume that vacuum\npolarization dominates the dielectric properties of the magnetosphere. The\nlatter is a good approximation if the pair multiplicity is not much larger than\nunity. Phase-averaged polarimetry is able to provide a clear signature of the\nmagnetospheric reprocessing of thermal photons and to constrain mechanisms\ngenerating the thermal emission. Phase-resolved polarimetry, in addition, can\ncharacterize the spatial extent and magnitude of the magnetospheric twist angle\nat ~100 stellar radii, and discern between uni- or bidirectional particle\nenergy distributions, almost independently of every other parameter in the\nsystem.

We\nfind that the inner regions of these galaxies have redder rest-frame\nUV--optical colors than the outer parts. The slopes of the color gradients\nmildly depend on the overall dust obscuration and rest-frame (U-V) color, with\nmore obscured or redder galaxies having steeper color gradients. The z~2 color\ngradients are also steeper than those of local early-types. The gradient of a\nsingle parameter (age, extinction or metallicity) cannot fully explain the\nobserved color gradients.

In a typical hat guessing game, after initially\ncoordinating a strategy, each of $n$ players is assigned a hat from a given\ncolor set. Simultaneously, each player tries to guess the color of his/her own\nhat by looking at colors of hats worn by other players. In this paper, we\nconsider a new variation of this game, in which we require at least $k$ correct\nguesses and no wrong guess for the players to win the game, but they can choose\nto \"pass\".\n  A strategy is called {\\em perfect} if it can achieve the simple upper bound\n$\\frac{n}{n+k}$ of the winning probability. We present sufficient and necessary\ncondition on the parameters $n$ and $k$ for the existence of perfect strategy\nin the hat guessing games. In fact for any fixed parameter $k$, the existence\nof perfect strategy can be determined for every sufficiently large $n$.\n  In our construction we introduce a new notion: $(d_1,d_2)$-regular partition\nof the boolean hypercube, which is worth to study in its own right. For\nexample, it is related to the $k$-dominating set of the hypercube. It also\nmight be interesting in coding theory. The existence of $(d_1,d_2)$-regular\npartition is explored in the paper and the existence of perfect $k$-dominating\nset follows as a corollary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 02:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 15:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-20"}

The present protocol uses the rateless code with the Frequency\nShift Keying (FSK) modulation scheme to overcome the reliability and power cost\nconcerns in tiny implantable sensors due to the considerable attenuation of\npropagated signals across the human body. In addition, the protocol allows a\nfast start-up time for the transceiver circuitry.

Due to the deflection of VHE cascade electrons by extragalactic\nmagnetic fields (EGMF), the spectral shape of this arriving cascade gamma-ray\nemission is dependent on the strength of the EGMF. Thus, the spectral shape of\nthe GeV-TeV emission from blazars has the potential to probe the EGMF strength\nalong the line of sight to the object. We investigate constraints on the EGMF\nderived from observations of blazars for which TeV observations simultaneous\nwith those by the Fermi telescope were reported. We study the dependence of the\nEGMF bound on the hidden assumptions it rests upon. We select blazar objects\nfor which simultaneous Fermi/LAT GeV and Veritas, MAGIC or HESS TeV emission\nhave been published. We model the development of electromagnetic cascades along\nthe gamma-ray beams from these sources using Monte Carlo simulations, including\nthe calculation of the temporal delay incurred by cascade photons, relative to\nthe light propagation time of direct gamma-rays from the source. Constraints on\nEGMF could be derived from the simultaneous GeV-TeV data on the blazars RGB\nJ0710+591, 1ES 0229+200, and 1ES 1218+304. The measured source flux level in\nthe GeV band is lower than the expected cascade component calculated under the\nassumption of zero EGMF. Assuming that the reason for the suppression of the\ncascade component is the extended nature of the cascade emission, we find that\nB>10^{-15} G (assuming EGMF correlation length of ~1 Mpc) is consistent with\nthe data. Alternatively, the assumption that the suppression of the cascade\nemission is caused by the time delay of the cascade photons the data are\nconsistent with B>10^{-17} G for the same correlation length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 10:38:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 14:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We found the superhump period to be P_sh=0.057122(14)days. Based on the\nO-C diagram we conclude that P_sh increased during the plateau at the rate of\ndP_sh/dt=(9.24 +- 1.4) * 10^-5. Both the O-C analysis and evolution of the\nsuperhumps light curve favour the model in which superhumps originate in a\nvariable source located in the vicinity of the hot spot. In addition, the\nevolution of the light curve suggests that the superhump light source\napproaches the disc plane as the superoutburst declines. Detailed analysis of\nthe superoutburst plateau phase enabled us to detect a signal which we\ninterpret as apsidal motion of the accretion disc. We detected additional\nmodulations during the final stage of the superoutburst characterized by\nperiods of 104s and 188s which we tentatively interpret as quasi periodic\noscillations. Estimations of A_0 and A_n are in agreement with the dependence\ndiscovered by Smak (2010) between the amplitude of superhumps and the orbital\ninclination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 11:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-06"}

HARPS can now reach a\nprecision below the meter-per-second, which corresponds to the amplitudes of\ndifferent stellar perturbations, such as oscillation, granulation, and\nactivity. Solar spot groups induced by activity produce a radial-velocity noise\nof a few meter-per-second. The aim of this paper is to simulate this activity\nand calculate detection limits according to different observational strategies.\nBased on Sun observations, we reproduce the evolution of spot groups on the\nsurface of a rotating star. We then calculate the radial-velocity effect\ninduced by these spot groups as a function of time. Taking into account\noscillation, granulation, activity, and a HARPS instrumental error of 80 cm/s,\nwe simulate the effect of different observational strategies in order to\nefficiently reduce all sources of noise. Applying three measurements per night\nof 10 minutes every three days, 10 nights a month seems the best tested\nstrategy. Depending on the level of activity considered, from log(R'_HK)= -5 to\n-4.75, this strategy would allow us to find planets of 2.5 to 3.5 Earth masses\nin the habitable zone of a K1V dwarf. Using Bern's model of planetary\nformation, we estimate that for the same range of activity level, 15 to 35 % of\nthe planets between 1 and 5 Earth masses and with a period between 100 and 200\ndays should be found with HARPS. A comparison between the performance of HARPS\nand ESPRESSO is also emphasized by our simulations. Using the same optimized\nstrategy, ESPRESSO could find 1.3 Earth mass planets in the habitable zone of\nearly-K dwarfs. In addition, 80 % of planets with mass between 1 and 5 Earth\nmasses and with a period between 100 and 200 days could be detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 12:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Two phases may be present either already at the beginning of the\nblowdown process (for instance in gas-liquid separators) or as the liquid is\nformed from flashing of the vapor due to the cooling induced by pressure\ndecrease. There is experimental evidence that the assumption of thermodynamic\nequilibrium is not appropriate, since the two phases show an independent\ntemperature evolution. Thus, due to the greater heat transfer between the\nliquid phase with the wall, the wall in contact with the liquid experiences a\nstronger cooling than the wall in contact with the gas, during the blowdown. As\na consequence, the vessel should be designed for a lower temperature than if it\nwas supposed to contain vapor only. Our model is based on a compositional\napproach, and it takes into account internal heat and mass transfer processes,\nas well as heat transfer with the vessel wall and the external environment.\nNumerical simulations show a generally good agreement with experimental\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 13:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-06"}

It\nis thus assumed that different source specific results ((S1/D)di, (S2/D)di)\nwould represent their sources (S1, S2), and be accurately intercomparable.\nHowever, the assumption has never been checked. In this manuscript we carry out\nthis task by considering a system as CO2+-IRMS. We present a model for a priori\npredicting output-uncertainty. Our study shows that scale-conversion, even with\nthe aid of auxiliary-reference-standard(s) Ai(s), cannot make (S/D)di free from\nW; and the ((S/W)di,(A1/W)di,(A2/W)di) To (S/D)di conversion-formula normally\nused in the literature is invalid.

Thus, equally accurate though the absolute-estimates of\nisotopic-CO2 and constituent-elemental-isotopic abundance-ratios could be, in\ncontradistinction any differential-estimate is shown to be less accurate.\nFurther, for S and D to be similar, any absolute estimate is shown to turn out\nnearly absolute accurate but any (S/D)d value as really absurd.

These tubes show multiple magnetic domes above the\nsurface, indicating that the secondary emergence is caused by interchange mode\nof magnetic buoyancy instability. As for the weakest twist case, the tube\nexhibits an elongated photospheric structure and never rises into the corona.\nThe formation of the photospheric structure is due to inward magnetic tension\nforce of the azimuthal field component of the rising flux tube (i.e., tube's\ntwist). When the twist is weak, azimuthal field cannot hold the tube's\ncoherency, and the tube extends laterally at the subadiabatic surface. In\naddition, we newly find that the total magnetic energy measured above the\nsurface depends on the initial twist. Strong twist tubes follow the initial\nrelation between the twist and the magnetic energy, while weak twist tubes\ndeviates from this relation, because these tubes store their magnetic energy in\nthe photospheric structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 14:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Notorious members are the Bernoulli model for binary data,\nleading to logistic regression, and the Poisson model for count data, leading\nto Poisson regression. Two of the main reasons for extending this family are\n(1) the occurrence of overdispersion, meaning that the variability in the data\nis not adequately described by the models, which often exhibit a prescribed\nmean--variance link, and (2) the accommodation of hierarchical structure in the\ndata, stemming from clustering in the data which, in turn, may result from\nrepeatedly measuring the outcome, for various members of the same family, etc.\nThe first issue is dealt with through a variety of overdispersion models, such\nas, for example, the beta-binomial model for grouped binary data and the\nnegative-binomial model for counts. Clustering is often accommodated through\nthe inclusion of random subject-specific effects. Though not always, one\nconventionally assumes such random effects to be normally distributed. While\nboth of these phenomena may occur simultaneously, models combining them are\nuncommon. This paper proposes a broad class of generalized linear models\naccommodating overdispersion and clustering through two separate sets of random\neffects. We place particular emphasis on so-called conjugate random effects at\nthe level of the mean for the first aspect and normal random effects embedded\nwithin the linear predictor for the second aspect, even though our family is\nmore general. The binary, count and time-to-event cases are given particular\nemphasis. Apart from model formulation, we present an overview of estimation\nmethods, and then settle for maximum likelihood estimation with\nanalytic--numerical integration. Implications for the derivation of marginal\ncorrelations functions are discussed. The methodology is applied to data from a\nstudy in epileptic seizures, a clinical trial in toenail infection named\nonychomycosis and survival data in children with asthma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 14:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

As the conventional constraints for extrasolar planets\nlike mass, radius, and temperature allow for a large number of acceptable\nmodels, a new planetary parameter is desirable in order to further constrain\nplanetary models. Such a parameter may be the tidal Love number k2. In this\npaper we aim to study the capability of k2 to reveal further information about\nthe interior structure of a planet. With theoretical planetary models we\ninvestigate how the tidal Love number k2 responds to the internal density\ndistribution of a planet. In particular, we demonstrate the effect of the\ndegeneracy of k2 due to a density discontinuity in the envelope of a\nthree-layer planetary model. The effect of a possible outer density\ndiscontinuity masks the effect of the core mass on the Love number k2. Hence,\nthere is no unique relationship between the Love number k2 and the core mass of\na planet. We show that the degeneracy of k2 with respect to a layer boundary in\nthe envelope also occurs in existing planets, e.g. Saturn and the Hot Neptune\nGJ436b. As a result of the degeneracy, the planetary parameter k2 cannot be\nused to further constrain Saturnian models and for GJ436b only a maximum\npossible core mass can be derived from a given k2. To significantly narrow the\nuncertainty about the core mass of GJ436b the combined knowledge of k2 and\natmospheric metallicity and temperature profile is necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 14:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Measuring these populations is difficult, but important for\nunderstanding the assembly of the most massive galaxies. The Coma cluster is\none of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a\ncorrespondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from\nthe HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a\nlarge population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core\nand is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1. The fraction of red IGCs (20%), and the red\ncolor of those GCs, implies that IGCs can originate from the halos of\nrelatively massive, L* galaxies, and not solely from the disruption of dwarf\ngalaxies.

So both related phenomena,\nsuperconductivity and superfluidity, get explanation which is based on the same\nphysical mechanism - they both are consequences of the ordering of zero-point\noscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 09:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 14:59:04 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 06:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 05:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Sun, 19 May 2013 05:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2013 10:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 16:27:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 08:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2011 13:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 08:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 08:39:25 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 08:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 05:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 05:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-06"}
