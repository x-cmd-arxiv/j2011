Apart from the ambiguity in the\nchoice of the quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations,\nthere also exists certain freedom in the choice of field: one can scale it\narbitrarily absorbing background functions, which are spatially homogeneous but\ndepend on time. Each nontrivial scaling turns out into a different dynamics\nand, in general, into an inequivalent quantum field theory. In this work we\nanalyze this freedom at the quantum level for a scalar field in a\nnonstationary, homogeneous spacetime whose spatial sections have $S^3$\ntopology. A scaling of the configuration variable is introduced as part of a\nlinear, time dependent canonical transformation in phase space. In this\ncontext, we prove in full detail a uniqueness result about the Fock\nquantization requiring that the dynamics be unitary and the spatial symmetries\nof the field equations have a natural unitary implementation. The main\nconclusion is that, with those requirements, only one particular canonical\ntransformation is allowed, and thus only one choice of field-momentum pair (up\nto irrelevant constant scalings). This complements another previous uniqueness\nresult for scalar fields with a time varying mass on $S^3$, which selects a\nspecific equivalence class of Fock representations of the canonical commutation\nrelations under the conditions of a unitary evolution and the invariance of the\nvacuum under the background symmetries. In total, the combination of these two\ndifferent statements of uniqueness picks up a unique Fock quantization for the\nsystem.

Truncating this tower to a\nsingle vector meson yields an extension of the standard Skyrme model to a\ntheory of pions coupled to the rho meson, with the significant simplification\nthat no additional free parameters are introduced. The present paper is\nconcerned with this truncated theory and results are presented for Skyrmions\nwith baryon numbers one to four. The approach involves the use of an extended\nversion of the Atiyah-Manton construction, in which the Skyrme field is\napproximated by the holonomy of a Yang-Mills instanton. It is found that the\ncoupling to the rho meson significantly reduces Skyrmion binding energies, to\nproduce an improved comparison with the experimental data on nuclei. A\ntruncation that includes both a vector and an axial vector meson is also\ninvestigated, providing a model of pions, the rho meson and the a1 meson.\nBinding energies are further reduced by the inclusion of this additional meson,\nshifting the Skyrmion energies a little closer to those of nuclei. Fixing the\nenergy unit by equating the energy of the baryon number four Skyrmion to the\nHe-4 mass, yields masses for all lower baryon numbers that are within 20 MeV of\nthe experimental values, which is an error that is four times smaller than in\nthe standard Skyrme model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 16:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

While some clouds seem to\ncollapse on their own, others may be triggered by an external event such as a\ncloud/flow collision forming a gravitationally unstable enhanced density layer.\nThis work tests cloud-cloud collisions as the triggering mechanism for star\nformation in the Serpens Main Cluster as has been suggested by previous work. A\nset of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the collision\nbetween two cylindrical clouds are performed and compared to (sub)millimetre\nobservations of the Serpens Main Cluster. A configuration has been found which\nreproduces many of the observed characteristics of Serpens, including some of\nthe main features of the peculiar velocity field. The evolution of the velocity\nwith position throughout the model is similar to that observed and the column\ndensity and masses within the modeled cloud agree with those measured for the\nSE sub-cluster. Furthermore, our results also show that an asymmetric collision\nprovides the ingredients to reproduce lower density filaments perpendicular to\nthe main structure, similar to those observed. In this scenario, the formation\nof the NW sub-cluster of Serpens can be reproduced only if there is a\npre-existing marginally gravitationally unstable region at the time the\ncollision occurs. This work supports the interpretation that a collision\nbetween two clouds may have been the trigger of the most recent burst of star\nformation in Serpens. It not only explains the complicated velocity structure\nseen in the region, but also the temperature differences between the north (in\n\"isolated\" collapse) and the south (resulting from the shock between the\nclouds). In addition it provides an explanation for the sources in the south\nhaving a larger spread in age than those in the north.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 17:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The basic\nset-up consists of a system with multiple agents corresponding to the nodes of\na graph whose edges encode the information that is available to the agents. We\naddress the question of whether the information flow defined by the graph is\nsufficient for the agents to accomplish a given task. Formation control is\nconcerned with problems in which agents are required to stabilize at a given\ndistance from other agents. In this context, the graph of a formation encodes\nboth the information flow and the distance constraints, by fixing the lengths\nof the edges. A formation is said to be rigid if it cannot be continuously\ndeformed with the distance constraints satisfied; a formation is minimally\nrigid if no distance constraint can be omitted without the formation losing its\nrigidity. Hence, the graph underlying minimally rigid formation provides just\nenough constraints to yield a rigid formation. An open question we will settle\nis whether the information flow afforded by a minimally rigid graph is\nsufficient to insure global stability. We show that the answer is negative in\nthe case of directed information flow. In this first part, we establish basic\nproperties of formation control in the plane.

This framework underscores the need to differentiate the knowledge\nan agent has about the task to accomplish from the knowledge an agent has about\nthe current state of the system.

We have started a project in order to\ncharacterize a large sample of FGs. In this paper we present the analysis of\nthe fossil system RX J105453.3+552102. Optical deep images were used for\nstudying the properties of the brightest group galaxy and for computing the\nphotometric luminosity function of the group. We have also performed a detail\ndynamical analysis of the system based on redshift data for 116 galaxies. This\ngalaxy system is located at z=0.47, and shows a quite large line-of-sight\nvelocity dispersion \\sigma_{v}~1000 km/s. Assuming the dynamical equilibrium,\nwe estimated a virial mass of M ~ 10^{15} h_{70} M_{\\odot}. No evidence of\nsubstructure was found within 1.4 Mpc radius. We found a statistically\nsignificant departure from Gaussianity of the group members velocities in the\nmost external regions of the group. This could indicate the presence of\ngalaxies in radial orbits in the external region of the group. We also found\nthat the photometrical luminosity function is bimodal, showing a lack of M_{r}\n~ -19.5 galaxies. The brightest group galaxy shows low Sersic parameter (n~2)\nand a small peculiar velocity. Indeed, our accurate photometry shows that the\ndifference between the brightest and the second brightest galaxies is 1.9 mag\nin the r-band, while the classical definition of FGs is based on a magnitude\ngap of 2. We conclude that this fossil system does not follow the empirical\ndefinition of FGs.

Unfortunately, a confident\ninference of the jet opening angle usually requires broadband measurement of\nthe afterglow of the GRB, from the X-ray down to the radio and from minutes to\ndays after the prompt gamma-ray emission, which may be difficult to obtain. For\nthis reason, very few of all detected GRBs have constrained jet angles. We\npresent an alternative approach to derive jet opening angles from the prompt\nemission of the GRB, given that the GRB has a measurable Epeak and fluence, and\nwhich does not require any afterglow measurements. We present the distribution\nof derived jet opening angles for the first two years of the Fermi Gamma-ray\nBurst Monitor (GBM) operation, and we compare a number of our derived opening\nangles to the reported opening angles using the traditional afterglow method.\nWe derive the collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy, E_{\\gamma}, for GRBs with\nredshift and find that some of the GRBs in our sample are inconsistent with a\nproto-magnetar progenitor.

In previous work a\nrange of beta between 0.9 and 1.0 was usually adopted. We use optical\nellipsoidal lightcurve data to constrain beta. We find neutron star masses of\n1.77 +/- 0.08 M_{sun} for Vela X-1, 0.87 +/- 0.07 M_{sun} for 4U 1538-52\n(eccentric orbit), 1.00 +/- 0.10 M_{sun} for 4U 1538-52 (circular orbit), 1.04\n+/- 0.09 M_{sun} for SMC X-1, 1.29 +/- 0.05 M_{sun} for LMC X-4, 1.49 +/- 0.08\nM_{sun} for Cen X-3, and 1.07 +/- 0.36 M_{sun} for Her X-1. We discuss the\nlimits of the approximations that were used to derive the earlier mass\ndeterminations, and we comment on the implications our new masses have for\nobservationally refining the upper and lower bounds of the neutron star mass\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 23:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We use an extraction technique based on prior source\npositions at shorter wavelengths to build the 24 and 70um source catalogs. The\nmajority (93%) of the sources have a spectroscopic (39%) or a photometric\nredshift (54%) and, in our redshift range of interest (i.e., 1.3<z<2.3) ~20% of\nthe sources have a spectroscopic redshifts. To extend our study to lower 70um\nluminosities we perform a stacking analysis and we characterize the observed\nL_24/(1+z) vs L_70/(1+z) correlation. Using spectral energy distribution\ntemplates which best fit this correlation, we derive the IR luminosity of\nsources from their 24 and 70 um fluxes. We then compute the IR LF at\nz=1.55+/-0.25 and z=2.05+/-0.25. The redshift evolution of the IR LF from z=1.3\nto z=2.3 is consistent with a luminosity evolution proportional to\n(1+z)^1.0+/-0.9 combined with a density evolution proportional to\n(1+z)^-1.1+/-1.5. At z~2, luminous IR galaxies (LIRGs: 10^11Lsun< LIR\n<10^12Lsun) are still the main contributors to the total comoving IR luminosity\ndensity (IR LD) of the Universe. At z~2, LIRGs and ultra-luminous IR galaxies\n(ULIRGs: 10^12Lsun< LIR) account for ~49% and ~17% respectively of the total IR\nLD of the Universe. Combined with previous results for galaxies at z<1.3 and\nassuming a constant conversion between the IR luminosity and star-formation\nrate (SFR) of a galaxy, we study the evolution of the SFR density of the\nUniverse from z=0 to z=2.3.

In addition, a main statement of the\narticle is that a field in a black hole decays at infinity according to a\nuniversal law. An example of such a field is an eigentensor of the Einstein's\nlinear operator that corresponds to an eigenvalue different from Zero. Possible\napplications to the stability of black holes of high dimension are discussed.\nThe analysis we present is of a small perturbation of space-time.

It is\nimportant in magnetic fusion and in space and solar physics --- areas that have\nso far provided the context for most of reconnection research. Importantly,\nthese environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy\nalways stays with the plasma. In contrast, in this paper I introduce a new\ndirection of research, motivated by several important problems in high-energy\nastrophysics --- reconnection in high energy density (HED) radiative plasmas,\nwhere radiation pressure and radiative cooling become dominant factors in the\npressure and energy balance. I identify the key processes distinguishing HED\nreconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative\ncooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme\nend, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main\nastrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields\n(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares\nand magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs. Here, magnetic\nenergy density is so high that its dissipation heats the plasma to MeV\ntemperatures. Electron-positron pairs are then copiously produced, making the\nreconnection layer highly collisional and dressing it in a thick pair coat that\ntraps radiation. The pressure is dominated by radiation and pairs. Yet,\nradiation diffusion across the layer may be faster than the global Alfv\\'en\ntransit time; then, radiative cooling governs the thermodynamics and\nreconnection becomes a radiative transfer problem, greatly affected by the\nultra-strong magnetic field. This overall picture is very different from our\ntraditional picture of reconnection and thus represents a new frontier in\nreconnection research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 01:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The baseline for the\nbroad and overlapping ice features is modeled, using calculated spectra of\ngiants, H2O ice and silicates. The adopted extinction curve is derived\nempirically. Its high resolution allows for the separation of continuum and\nfeature extinction. The extinction between 13-25 um is ~50% relative to that at\n2.2 um. The strengths of the 6.0 and 6.85 um absorption bands are in line with\nthose of YSOs. Thus, their carriers, which, besides H2O and CH3OH, may include\nNH4+, HCOOH, H2CO and NH3, are readily formed in the dense core phase, before\nstars form.

In particular, it allows for confining light in dimensions smaller than\nthe wavelength of photons in free space, and makes it possible to match the\ndifferent length scales associated with photonics and electronics in a single\nnanoscale device. Broad applications of plasmonics have been realized including\nbiological sensing, sub-diffraction-limit imaging, focusing and lithography,\nand nano optical circuitry. Plasmonics-based optical elements such as\nwaveguides, lenses, beam splitters and reflectors have been implemented by\nstructuring metal surfaces or placing dielectric structures on metals, aiming\nto manipulate the two-dimensional surface plasmon waves.

Transformation optics provides an unprecedented approach to\nroute light at will by spatially varying the optical properties of a material.\nHere, motivated by this approach, we use grey-scale lithography to\nadiabatically tailor the topology of a dielectric layer adjacent to a metal\nsurface to demonstrate a plasmonic Luneburg lens that can focus SPPs.

We start\nconsidering the behavior of a single particle and apply a random walk to\ndescribe advection/dispersion plus a Markov chain to describe kinetic sorption.\nWe show in a rigorous way that this model leads to a set of differential\nequations. For this combination of stochastic processes such a derivation is\nnew. Then, to illustrate the mechanism that leads to non-Gaussian spreading we\nanalyze this set of equations at first leaving out the Gaussian dispersion term\n(microdispersion). The set of equations now transforms to the telegrapher's\nequation. Characteristic for this system is a longitudinal spreading, that\nbecomes Gaussian only in the long-time limit. We refer to this as kinetics\ninduced spreading. When the microdispersion process is included back again, the\ncharacteristics of the telegraph equations are still present. Now two spreading\nphenomena are active, the Gaussian microdispersive spreading plus the kinetics\ninduced non-Gaussian spreading. In the long run the latter becomes Gaussian as\nwell. Another non-Gaussian feature shows itself in the 2D situation. Here, the\nlateral spread and the longitudinal displacement are no longer independent, as\nshould be the case for a 2D Gaussian spreading process. In a displacing plume\nthis interdependence is displayed as a `tailing' effect. We also analyze\nmarginal and conditional moments, which confirm this result. With respect to\neffective properties (velocity and dispersion) we conclude that effective\nparameters can be defined properly only for large times (asymptotic times). In\nthe two-dimensional case it appears that the transverse spreading depends on\nthe longitudinal coordinate. This results in `cigar-shaped' contours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 09:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-14"}

Although correlation\neffects are too small to be resolved by present STM experiments for the studied\nmolecules, our results provide hints for seeking out other species with larger,\nand possibly experimentally detectable, correlation effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 09:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-14"}

Therefore, a new experimental setup was\nconstructed to investigate the temperature dependent sublimation properties of\nhexagonal water ice and the gas diffusion through a dry dust layer covering the\nice surface. We show that this experimental setup is capable to reproduce known\ngas production rates of pure hexagonal water ice. The reduction of the gas\nproduction rate due to an additional dust layer on top of the ice surface was\nmeasured and compared to the results of another experimental setup in which the\ngas diffusion through dust layers at room temperature was investigated. We\nfound that the relative permeability of the dust layer is inversely\nproportional to its thickness, which is also predicted by theoretical models.\nHowever, the measured absolute weakening of the gas flow was smaller than\npredicted by models. This lack of correspondence between model and experiment\nmay be caused by an ill-determination of the boundary condition in the\ntheoretical models, which further demonstrates the necessity of laboratory\ninvestigations. Furthermore, the impedance of the dust layer to the ice\nevaporation was found to be similar to the impedance at room temperature, which\nmeans that the temperature profile of the dust layer is not influencing the\nreduction of the gas production.

Since the Hubble parameter in this cosmology reproduces the same\nLCDM expansion history, we study how upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as\nEuclid and DES (Dark Energy Survey), can confirm or rule out this class of\nmodels.

We follow a blackbox approach in which we\nconsider components that perform operations on the biometric data they contain\nand where only the input/output behavior of these components is analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 14:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This resonant scenario should leave a clearly different signature\nin the element abundances of stream stars than the dispersed cluster scenario,\nsince the Hyades cluster is chemically homogeneous.

In this paper we show how his bound may be improved if we have some\nadditional information about the domain Omega of S: if S separates the points\nof Omega, then w(S) \\geq \\binom{|\\Omega|}{2}. This is stronger than Reimer's\nTheorem when Omega > \\sqrt{|S|\\log_2 |S|}. In addition we construct a family of\nexamples showing the combined bound on w(S) is tight except in the region\n|\\Omega|=\\Theta (\\sqrt{|S|\\log_2 |S|}), where it may be off by a multiplicative\nfactor of 2. Our proof also gives a lower bound on the average degree: if S is\na point-separating union-closed family, then the average degree over its domain\nis at least 1/2 \\sqrt{|S| \\log_2 |S|}+ O(1), and this is best possible except\nfor a multiplicative factor of 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 15:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}

Accurately\nconstructing these networks presents a daunting challenge given the\ndifficulties associated with accounting for inter-subject topological\nvariability. Viable approaches to this task must engender networks that capture\nthe constitutive topological properties of the group of subjects' networks that\nit is aiming to represent. The conventional approach has been to use a mean or\nmedian correlation network (Achard et al., 2006; Song et al., 2009) to embody a\ngroup of networks. However, the degree to which their topological properties\nconform with those of the groups that they are purported to represent has yet\nto be explored. Here we investigate the performance of these mean and median\ncorrelation networks. We also propose an alternative approach based on an\nexponential random graph modeling framework and compare its performance to that\nof the aforementioned conventional approach. Simpson et al. (2010) illustrated\nthe utility of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) for creating brain\nnetworks that capture the topological characteristics of a single subject's\nbrain network. However, their advantageousness in the context of producing a\nbrain network that \"represents\" a group of brain networks has yet to be\nexamined.
