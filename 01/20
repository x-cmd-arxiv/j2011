In\naddition, some predicted Xe II lines are redshifted by about 0.1 A from stellar\nunidentified lines, raising the question about the wavelength accuracy of the\nXe II line data available in the literature. For these reasons we investigated\nthe Xe II lines lying in the 3900-4521 A, 4769-7542 A, and 7660-8000 A spectral\nranges of four well-studied HgMn stars. We compared the Xe II wavelengths\nlisted in the NIST database with the position of the lines observed in the\nhigh-resolution UVES spectrum of the xenon-overabundant, slowly rotating HgMn\nstars HR 6000, and we modified them when needed.

In this framework, we performed a\ncomplete abundance analysis of HD 71066, while we relied on our previous works\nfor the other stars.

To accomplish this task, we have developed a novel method for variables\nseparation in wave equation, which enables one, in principle, to rigorously\nexamine any limiting case --- from negligibly weak to arbitrarily strong\ndisorder. It is shown that the effect of disorder-induced scattering can be\nproperly described in terms of two geometric potentials, specifically, the\n\"amplitude\" and the \"gradient\" potentials, which appear in wave equation in the\ncourse of conformal smoothing of the resonator boundaries. The scattering\nresulting from the gradient potential appears to be dominant, and its impact on\nthe whole spectrum is governed by the unique sharpness parameter $\\Xi$, the\nmean tangent of the asperity slope. As opposed to the resonator with bulk\ndisorder, the distribution of nearest-neighbor spacings (NNS) in the\nrough-resonator spectrum acquires Wigner-like features only when the wave\noperator loses its unitarity, i.e., with the availability in the system of\neither openness or dissipation channels. Our numeric experiments suggest that\nin the absence of dissipation loss the random-rough resonator spectrum is\nalways regular, whatever the degree of roughness. Yet, the spectrum structure\nis quite different in the domains of small and large values of the parameter\n$\\Xi$.

At low\ntemperatures and densities, the structure of the system is characterized by the\npresence of long linear chains interconnected by a small number of three\ncoordinated junctions at random locations. At small wave-vectors the static\nstructure factor shows a non-monotonic dependence on temperature, a behavior\nwhich is due to the competition between the percolation transition of the\nparticles and the stiffening of the formed chains. We compare in detail the\nrelaxation dynamics of the system as obtained from molecular dynamics with the\none obtained from Monte Carlo dynamics. We find that the bond correlation\nfunction displays stretched exponential behavior at moderately low temperatures\nand densities, but exponential relaxation at low temperatures. The bond\nlifetime shows an Arrhenius behavior, independent of the microscopic dynamics.\nFor the molecular dynamics at low temperatures, the mean squared displacement\nand the (coherent and incoherent) intermediate scattering function display at\nintermediate times a dynamics with ballistic character and we show that this\nleads to compressed exponential relaxation. For the Monte Carlo dynamics we\nfind always an exponential or stretched exponential relaxation.

Westmoreland investigate a\nversion of quantum mechanics which they call \"modal quantum theory\" but which\nwe prefer to call \"discrete quantum theory\". This theory is obtained by\ninstantiating the mathematical framework of Hilbert spaces with a finite field\ninstead of the field of complex numbers. This instantiation collapses much the\nstructure of actual quantum mechanics but retains several of its distinguishing\ncharacteristics including the notions of superposition, interference, and\nentanglement. Furthermore, discrete quantum theory excludes local hidden\nvariable models, has a no-cloning theorem, and can express natural counterparts\nof quantum information protocols such as superdense coding and teleportation.\nOur first result is to distill a model of discrete quantum computing from this\nquantum theory. The model is expressed using a monadic metalanguage built on\ntop of a universal reversible language for finite computations, and hence is\ndirectly implementable in a language like Haskell. In addition to\nsuperpositions and invertible linear maps, the model includes conventional\nprogramming constructs including pairs, sums, higher-order functions, and\nrecursion. Our second result is to relate this programming model to relational\nprogramming, e.g., a pure version of Prolog over finite relations. Surprisingly\ndiscrete quantum computing is identical to conventional logic programming\nexcept for a small twist that is responsible for all the ``quantum-ness.'' The\ntwist occurs when merging sets of answers computed by several alternatives: the\nanswers are combined using an \"exclusive\" version of logical disjunction. In\nother words, the two branches of a choice junction exhibit an \"interference\"\neffect: an answer is produced from the junction if it occurs in one or the\nother branch but not both.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 20:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-20"}

Aims: Starting from a non-equilibrium state with a dense chromospheric\nlayer, we analyse the evolution of the internal plasma dynamics of magnetic\nloops, subject to line-tying boundary conditions, and with the coronal\nparameters described in Asai et al. (2001) and Melnikov et al. (2002) to\ninvestigate the onset and damping of sausage modes. Methods: To integrate the\nequations we used a high resolution shock-capturing (HRSC) method specially\ndesigned to deal appropriately with flow discontinuities. Results: Due to\nnon-linearities and inhomogeneities, pure modes are difficult to sustain and\nalways occur coupled among them so as to satisfy, e.g., the line-tying\nconstraint. We found that, in one case, the resonant coupling of the sausage\nfundamental mode with a slow one results in a non-dissipative damping of the\nformer. Conclusions: In scenarios of thick and dense loops, where the\nanalytical theory predicts the existence of fundamental trapped sausage modes,\nthe coupling of fast and slow quasi-periodic modes -with a node at the center\nof the longitudinal speed- occur contributing to the damping of the fast mode.\nIf a discontinuity in the total pressure between the loop and the corona is\nassumed, a fundamental fast sausage transitory leaky regime is spontaneously\nproduced and an external compressional Alfv\\'en wave takes away the magnetic\nenergy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-21"}

We find the\noptical/IR time variability properties of these blazars to be remarkably\nsimilar to those at the gamma-ray energies. The power spectral density (PSD)\nfunctions of the R-band variability of all six blazars are fit well by simple\npower-law functions with negative slope such that there is higher amplitude\nvariability on longer timescales. No clear break is identified in the PSD of\nany of the sources. The average slope of the PSD of R-band variability of these\nblazars is similar to what was found by the Fermi team for the gamma-ray\nvariability of a larger sample of bright blazars. This is consistent with\nleptonic models where the optical-IR and gamma-ray emission is generated by the\nsame population of electrons through synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes,\nrespectively. The prominent flares present in the optical-IR as well as the\ngamma-ray light curves of these blazars are predominantly symmetric, i.e., have\nsimilar rise and decay timescales, indicating that the long-term variability is\ndominated by the crossing time of radiation or a disturbance through the\nemission region rather than by the acceleration or energy-loss timescales of\nthe radiating electrons.

When a node (referred to as\nthe source) gets a packet to forward, either by detecting an event or from an\nupstream node, it has to wait for its neighbors in a forwarding set (referred\nto as relays) to wake-up. Each of the relays is associated with a random reward\n(e.g., the progress made towards the sink) that is iid. To begin with, the\nsource is uncertain about the number of relays, their wake-up times and the\nreward values, but knows their distributions. At each relay wake-up instant,\nwhen a relay reveals its reward value, the source's problem is to forward the\npacket or to wait for further relays to wake-up. In this setting, we seek to\nminimize the expected waiting time at the source subject to a lower bound on\nthe average reward. In terms of the operations research literature, our work\ncan be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem. We formulate the\nrelay selection problem as a partially observable Markov decision process\n(POMDP), where the unknown state is the number of relays. We begin by\nconsidering the case where the source knows the number of relays. For the\ngeneral case, where the source only knows a pmf on the number of relays, it has\nto maintain a posterior pmf on the number of relays and forward the packet iff\nthe pmf is in an optimum stopping set. We show that the optimum stopping set is\nconvex and obtain inner and outer bounds to this set. The computational\ncomplexity of the above policies motivates us to formulate an alternative\nsimplified model, the optimal policy for which is a simple threshold rule. We\nprovide simulation results to compare the performance of the various one-hop\nand end-to-end forwarding policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 08:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-21"}

Then, using this symplectomorphism\nand recent GIT arguments from Ressayre, we compute the equations of the\nprojection of the O, relatively to the maximal compact subgroup K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 09:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This effect is severe in\ncase of failure of a critical link in the network, such as backbone links or\nthe links carrying higher traffic loads. When routing is done using the Open\nShortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, the original weight selection for\nthe normal state topology may not be as efficient for the failure state. In\nthis paper, we investigate the single link failure issue with an objective to\nfind a weight setting which results in efficient routing in normal and failure\nstates.

Previous studies of the molecular deuteration\ntoward the solar-type class 0 protostar, IRAS 16293-2422, have shown that the\nD/H ratio of water is significantly lower than other grain-surface-formed\nmolecules. It is not clear if this property is general or particular to this\nsource. In order to see if the results toward IRAS 16293-2422 are particular,\nwe aimed at studying water deuterium fractionation in a second low-mass\nsolar-type protostar, NGC1333-IRAS2A. Using the 1-D radiative transfer code\nRATRAN, we analyzed five HDO transitions observed with the IRAM 30m, JCMT, and\nAPEX telescopes. We assumed that the abundance profile of HDO in the envelope\nis a step function, with two different values in the inner warm (T>100 K) and\nouter cold (T<100 K) regions of the protostellar envelope. The inner and outer\nabundance of HDO is found to be well constrained at the 3 sigma level. The\nobtained HDO inner and outer fractional abundances are x_in=6.6e-8 - 1e-7 and\nx_out=9e-11 - 1.8e-9 (3 sigma). These values are close to those in IRAS\n16293-2422, which suggests that HDO may be formed by the same mechanisms in\nthese two solar-type protostars. Taking into account the (rather poorly\nconstrained) H2O abundance profile deduced from Herschel observations, the\nderived HDO/H2O in the inner envelope is larger than 1% and in the outer\nenvelope it is 0.9%-18%. These values are more than one order of magnitude\nhigher than what is measured in comets. If the same ratios apply to the\nprotosolar nebula, this would imply that there is some efficient reprocessing\nof the material between the protostellar and cometary phases.

The result is of two-fold significance for spin quantum\ntechnology: (1) a resource of entanglement for nuclear spin based quantum\ninformation processing; (2) a cleaner surrounding and less quantum noise for\nthe electron spin as the environmental spin moments are effectively\nannihilated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 12:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-22"}

The\nsimplest and most popular model is Synchrotron, Self-Compton (SSC) emission\nproduced by internal shocks inside an ultra-relativistic jet. However, recent\nobservations of a delayed high energy component have encouraged alternative\nmodels. Here we use a recently developed formulation of relativistic shocks to\nsimulate GRBs. It takes into account the evolution of quantities such as\ndensities of colliding shells, electric and magnetic fields. We also extend the\nprevious formulation by considering a precessing external magnetic field. These\nsimulations are very realistic and present significant improvement with respect\nto previous phenomenological GRB simulations. They reproduce light curves of\nseparated peaks of real GRBs and variety of observed spectral slopes at E >\nE_{peak}. The high energy emission can be explained by synchrotron emission and\na subdominant contribution from inverse Compton. We also suggest an explanation\nfor the extended tail emission observed by the Fermi-LAT instrument and relate\nit to the screening of the magnetic field and/or trapping of accelerated\nelectrons in the electromagnetic energy structure of the plasma in the shock\nfront. Spectral slopes of simulated bursts at E << E_{peak} are consistent with\ntheoretical prediction and at E < E_{peak} can be flatter if the spectrum of\nelectrons is roughly flat or has a shallow slope. The observed flat spectra at\nsoft gamma-ray and hard x-ray bands is the evidence that there is a significant\ncontribution at $E < E_{peak}$ from lower Lorentz factor wing of electrons\ndistribution which have a roughly random acceleration rather than being\nthermal. This means that the state of matter in the jet at the time of ejection\nis most probably nonthermal and electrons have a shallow spectrum at low\nenergies.(abbreviated)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 14:16:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 07:47:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 09:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Understanding the EoR is difficult since whilst it is galaxy\nevolution which drives reionization, reionization itself influences galaxy\nevolution through feedback effects. Unraveling the interplay of reionization\nand galaxy evolution is further complicated by of a lack of understanding of\nthe metal enrichment and dust distribution in high redshift galaxies.

Such a conclusion contradicts, however, an\nold result of Malik and Pradhan, who showed that it is indeed possible to\nintroduce an extra abelian gauge field directly in the vacuum Maxwell equations\nin order to render them covariant under local duality transformations. Since it\nis well known that the equations of motion can, in general, admit more\nsymmetries than the associate Lagrangian, this would not be a paradoxal result,\nin principle. Here, we revisit these works and identify the source of the\ndifferent conclusions. We show that the Malik-Pradhan procedure does not\npreserve the original Maxwell gauge invariance, while Bunster, Henneaux, and\nDeser sought for generalizations which are, by construction, invariant under\nthe Maxwell gauge transformation. Further, we show that the Malik-Pradhan\nconstruction cannot be adapted or extended in order to preserve the Maxwell\ngauge invariance, reinforcing the conclusion that it is not possible to gauge\nthe electromagnetic duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 15:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 16:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-03"}

Multilayered systems provide us with the\nopportunity to research the characteristics of the disorder-free CuO$_2$ plane.\nThe site-selective NMR is the best and the only tool used to extract\nlayer-dependent characteristics.

These trellises are based on characteristic generators, as\nintroduced by Koetter/Vardy (2003), and may be regarded as a natural\ngeneralization of minimal conventional trellises, even though they are not\nnecessarily minimal. Two dualization techniques will be investigated: the local\ndualization, introduced by Forney (2001) for general normal graphs, and a\nlinear algebra based dualization tailored to the specific class of tail-biting\nBCJR-trellises, introduced by Nori/Shankar (2006). It turns out that, in\ngeneral, the BCJR-dual is a subtrellis of the local dual, while for\nKV-trellises these two coincide. Furthermore, making use of both the\nBCJR-construction and the local dualization, it will be shown that for each\ncomplete set of characteristic generators of a code there exists a complete set\nof characteristic generators of the dual code such that their resulting\nKV-trellises are dual to each other if paired suitably. This proves a stronger\nversion of a conjecture formulated by Koetter/Vardy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 15:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-21"}

However, several issues are yet to be clarified: SNe~Ia show\ncolor variations after the standardization. Also, individual SNe~Ia can show\nresiduals in their standardized peak absolute magnitude at the level of $\\sim\n0.15$ mag. In this paper, we explore how the color and luminosity residual are\nrelated to the wavelength shift of nebular emission lines observed at $\\gsim\n150$ days after maximum light. A sample of 11 SNe Ia which likely suffer from\nlittle host extinction indicates a correlation ($3.3\\sigma$) between the peak\n$B-V$ color and the late-time emission-line shift. Furthermore, a nearly\nidentical relation applies for a larger sample in which only three SNe with\n$B-V \\gsim 0.2$ mag are excluded. Following the interpretation that the\nlate-time emission-line shift is a tracer of the viewing direction from which\nan off-centre explosion is observed, we suggest that the viewing direction is a\ndominant factor controlling the SN color and that a large part of the color\nvariations is intrinsic, rather than due to the host extinction. We also\ninvestigate a relation between the peak luminosity residuals and the wavelength\nshift in nebular emission lines in a sample of 20 SNe. We thereby found a hint\nof a correlation (at $\\sim 1.6 \\sigma$ level). The confirmation of this will\nrequire a future sample of SNe with more accurate distance estimates. Radiation\ntransfer simulations for a toy explosion model where different viewing angles\ncause the late-time emission-line shift are presented, predicting a strong\ncorrelation between the color and shift, and a weaker one for the luminosity\nresidual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 15:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
