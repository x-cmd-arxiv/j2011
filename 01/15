Significant attention has been devoted in the\nliterature so far to the energy balance during the CE event, expected to\ndetermine the outcome. However this question is intrinsically coupled with the\nproblem of what is left from the donor star after the CE and its immediate\nevolution. In this paper we argue that an important stage has been overlooked:\npost-CE remnant thermal readjustment phase. We propose a methodology for\nunambiguously defining the post-CE remnant mass after it has been thermally\nreadjusted, namely by calling the core boundary the radius in the hydrogen\nshell corresponding to the local maximum of the sonic velocity. We argue that\nthe important consequences of the thermal readjustment phase are: (i) a change\nin the energy budget requirement for the CE binaries and (ii) a companion\nspin-up and chemical enrichment, as a result of the mass transfer that occurs\nduring the remnant thermal readjustment (TR). More CE binaries are expected to\nmerge. If the companion is a neutron star, it will be mildly recycled during\nthe TR phase. The mass transfer during the TR phase is much stronger than the\naccretion rate during the common envelope, and therefore satisfies the\ncondition for a hypercritical accretion better. We also argue that the TR phase\nis responsible for a production of mildly recycled pulsars in double neutron\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 17:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This is an example of\n`galaxy mass downsizing', and is the result of massive galaxies forming before\nlower mass ones, and not just simply ending their star formation earlier as in\ntraditional downsizing scenarios. We find that the faint end slope is\nsignificantly steeper than what is found in previous investigations. We\ndemonstrate that this steeper mass function better matches the stellar mass\nadded due to star formation, thereby alleviating some of the mismatch between\nthese two measures of the evolution of galaxy mass. We furthermore examine the\nstellar mass function divided into blue/red systems, as well as for star\nforming and non-star forming galaxies. We find a similar mass downsizing\npresent for both blue/red and star-forming/non-star forming galaxies, and that\nthe low mass galaxies are mostly all blue, and are therefore creating the steep\nmass functions. We furthermore show that, although there is a downsizing such\nthat high mass galaxies are nearer their z=0 values at high redshift, this\nturns over at masses Mstar~10^10 Msun, such that the lowest mass galaxies are\nmore common than galaxies at slight higher masses, creating a `dip' in the\nobserved galaxy mass function. We argue that the galaxy assembly process may be\ndriven by different mechanisms at low and high masses, and that the efficiency\nof the galaxy formation process is lowest at masses Mstar~10^10 Msun at 1<z<3.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 17:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 14:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We use a Spitzer, IRAC 3.6 micron image to\nperform a detailed structural analysis of this galaxy. If one fits to this\nimage only bulge and disc components, the bulge occupies a locus in the\nmass-size relation close to that of elliptical galaxies. When an outer stellar\nspheroid is added to improve the fit, the bulge Sersic index drops by a factor\nof ~ 2, and, if taken at face value, could mean that this bulge is actually a\ndisc-like, pseudo-bulge, or a bar viewed end-on. The bulge effective radius and\nthe bulge-to-total ratio also drop dramatically, putting the bulge in a\nposition closer to that of bulges in the mass-size relation. We discuss\nimplications from these findings, including the locus of the Sombrero bulge in\nthe black hole mass vs. bulge mass relation. With this new bulge mass estimate,\ncurrent dynamical estimates for the mass of the central black hole in Sombrero\nare more than 10 times larger than expected, if only the bulge mass is\nconsidered.

Based on this elementary classification, we analyze\nstochastic fluctuations and calculate scaling laws of the variance of\nstochastic sample paths near critical transitions for fast subsystem\nbifurcations up to codimension two. The theory is applied to several models:\nthe Stommel-Cessi box model for the thermohaline circulation from geoscience,\nan epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive network, an activator-inhibitor\nswitch from systems biology, a predator-prey system from ecology and to the\nEuler buckling problem from classical mechanics. For the Stommel-Cessi model we\ncompare different detrending techniques to calculate early-warning signs. In\nthe epidemics model we show that link densities could be better variables for\nprediction than population densities. The activator-inhibitor switch\ndemonstrates effects in three time-scale systems and points out that excitable\ncells and molecular units have information for subthreshold prediction. In the\npredator-prey model explosive population growth near a codimension two\nbifurcation is investigated and we show that early-warnings from normal forms\ncan be misleading in this context.

We first note that when dealing\nwith multivariate data it is imperative to first determine the true\ncorrelations among the variables, not those introduced by the observational\nselection effects, before obtaining the individual distributions of the\nvariables. We use the methods developed by Efron and Petrosian which are\ndesigned to obtain unbiased correlations, distributions, and evolution with\nredshift from a data set truncated due to observational biases. It is found\nthat the population of quasars exhibits strong positive correlation between the\nradio and optical luminosities. With this correlation, whether intrinsic or\nobservationally induced accounted for, we find that there is a strong\nluminosity evolution with redshift in both wavebands, with significantly higher\nradio than optical evolution. We also construct the local radio and optical\nluminosity functions and the density evolution. Finally, we consider the\ndistribution of the radio loudness parameter R obtained from careful treatment\nof the selection effects and luminosity evolutions with that obtained from the\nraw data without such considerations. We find a significant difference between\nthe two distributions and no clear sign of bi-modality in the true distribution\nfor the range of R values considered. Our results indicate therefore, somewhat\nsurprisingly, that there is no critical switch in the efficiency of the\nproduction of disk outflows/jets between very radio quiet and very radio loud\nquasars, but rather a smooth transition. Also, this efficiency seems higher for\nthe high-redshift and more luminous sources in the considered sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2011 00:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2011 01:35:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 18:16:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 02:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
