How to benefit from the adversary's\nuncertainty about the data? We have found that random sampling provides a\nconnection that helps answer these two questions, as sampling can create\nuncertainty. The main result of the paper is that $k$-anonymization, when done\n\"safely\", and when preceded with a random sampling step, satisfies\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy with reasonable parameters. This\nresult illustrates that \"hiding in a crowd of $k$\" indeed offers some privacy\nguarantees. This result also suggests an alternative approach to output\nperturbation for satisfying differential privacy: namely, adding a random\nsampling step in the beginning and pruning results that are too sensitive to\nchange of a single tuple. Regarding the second question, we provide both\npositive and negative results. On the positive side, we show that adding a\nrandom-sampling pre-processing step to a differentially-private algorithm can\ngreatly amplify the level of privacy protection. Hence, when given a dataset\nresulted from sampling, one can utilize a much large privacy budget. On the\nnegative side, any privacy notion that takes advantage of the adversary's\nuncertainty likely does not compose. We discuss what these results imply in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 16:18:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 02:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

At high energies, the search for such line features in the\ncosmic gamma-ray spectrum is essentially background free because plausible\nastrophysical processes are not expected to produce such a signal. The\nobservation of a gamma-ray line would hence be a `smoking-gun' signature for\ndark matter, making the search for such signals particularly attractive. Among\nthe different dark matter models predicting gamma-ray lines, the local\nsupersymmetric extension of the standard model with small R-parity violation\nand gravitino LSP is of particular interest because it provides a framework\nwhere primordial nucleosynthesis, gravitino dark matter and thermal\nleptogenesis are naturally consistent. Using the two-years Fermi LAT data, we\npresent a dedicated search for gamma-ray lines coming from dark matter\nannihilation or decay in the Galactic halo. Taking into account the full\ndetector response, and using a binned profile likelihood method, we search for\nsignificant line features in the energy spectrum of the diffuse flux observed\nin different regions of the sky. No evidence for a line signal at the 5-sigma\nlevel is found for photon energies between 1 and 300 GeV, and conservative\nbounds on dark matter decay rates and annihilation cross sections are\npresented.

This scenario is compatible with a\nrecently-formed rapidly rotating bar which has had insufficient time to slow\ndown because of secular evolution, and thus has not yet formed an inner\nLindblad resonance (ILR). The presence of molecular gas inside the CR of the\nprimary bar, where we expect that the ILR will form, makes NGC 3627 a potential\nsmoking gun of inner gas inflow. The gas is fueling the central region, and in\na second step could fuel directly the active nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 17:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The maximum polarised intensity depends on the physical\nproperties of the depolarising medium. New-generation radio telescopes like\nLOFAR, SKA and its precursors need a wide range of frequencies to cover the\nfull range of objects. The optimum frequency of maximum polarised intensity\n(PI) is computed for the cases of depolarisation in magneto-ionic media by\nregular magnetic fields (differential Faraday rotation) or by turbulent\nmagnetic fields (internal or external Faraday dispersion), assuming that the\nFaraday spectrum of the medium is dominated by one component or that the medium\nis turbulent. Polarised emission from bright galaxy disks, spiral arms and\ncores of galaxy clusters are best observed at wavelengths below a few\ncentimeters (at frequencies beyond about 10 GHz), halos of galaxies and\nclusters around decimeter wavelengths (at frequencies below about 2 GHz).\nIntergalactic filaments need observations at meter wavelengths (frequencies\nbelow 300 MHz). Sources with extremely large intrinsic $|RM|$ or RM dispersion\ncan be searched with mm-wave telescopes. Measurement of the PI spectrum allows\nus to derive the average Faraday rotation measure $|RM|$ or the Faraday\ndispersion within the source, as demonstrated for the case of the spiral galaxy\nNGC 6946. Periodic fluctuations in PI at low frequencies are a signature of\ndifferential Faraday rotation. Internal and external Faraday dispersion can be\ndistinguished by the different slopes of the PI spectrum at low frequencies.

From analysis of the emerging\nspectra we identify three main reasons why these average representations are\ninadequate for accurate determination of stellar atmospheric properties through\nspectroscopic analysis. These reasons are: non-linearity in the Planck function\nwith temperature, which raises the average emergent intensity of an\ninhomogeneous atmosphere above that of an average-property atmosphere, even if\ntheir temperature-optical depth stratification is identical; non-linearities in\nmolecular formation with temperature and density, which raise the abundance of\nmolecules of an inhomogeneous atmosphere over that in a one-dimensional model\nwith the same average properties; the anisotropy of convective motions, which\nstrongly affects the center-to-limb variation of line-core intensities.

The code development is centered on common XML and HDF5 data formats,\nlibraries to simplify and speed up code development, common evaluation and\nplotting tools, and simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to\nstart carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations by providing basic\nimplementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models:\nclassical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended\nensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED), the density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) both in a static version and a dynamic\ntime-evolving block decimation (TEBD) code, and quantum Monte Carlo solvers for\ndynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The ALPS libraries provide a powerful\nframework for programers to develop their own applications, which, for\ninstance, greatly simplify the steps of porting a serial code onto a parallel,\ndistributed memory machine. Major changes in release 2.0 include the use of\nHDF5 for binary data, evaluation tools in Python, support for the Windows\noperating system, the use of CMake as build system and binary installation\npackages for Mac OS X and Windows, and integration with the VisTrails workflow\nprovenance tool.

A key goal is\nto test how core evolution and properties depend on the velocity dispersion in\nthe parent cloud; our simulation suite consists of 180 models with inflow Mach\nnumbers Ma=v/c_s=1.1-9. At all Mach numbers, our models show that turbulence\nand self-gravity collect gas within post-shock regions into filaments at the\nsame time as overdense areas within these filaments condense into cores. This\nmorphology, together with the subsonic velocities we find inside cores, is\nsimilar to observations. We extend previous results showing that core collapse\ndevelops in an ``outside-in'' manner, with density and velocity approaching the\nLarson-Penston asymptotic solution. The time for the first core to collapse\nvaries as 1/sqrt(v), consistent with analytic estimates. Core building takes 10\ntimes as long as core collapse, consistent with observed prestellar core\nlifetimes. Core shapes change from oblate to prolate as they evolve. To define\ncores, we use isosurfaces of the gravitational potential. We compare to cores\ndefined using the potential computed from projected surface density, finding\ngood agreement for core masses and sizes; this offers a new way to identify\ncores in observed maps. Cores with masses varying by three orders of magnitude\n(0.05 - 50 M_sun) are identified in our simulations. Stability analysis of\npost-shock layers predicts that the first core to collapse will have mass M\n\\propto v^-1/2, and that the minimum mass for cores formed at late times will\nhave M\\propto v^-1. From our simulations, the median mass lies between these\ntwo relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 20:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The maximum entropy principle put forward\nin 1957 by E. T. Jaynes suggests what quantum states one should expect in\nequilibrium but does not hint as to how closed quantum many-body systems\ndynamically equilibrate. A number of theoretical and numerical studies\naccumulate evidence that under specific conditions quantum many-body models can\nrelax to a situation that locally or with respect to certain observables\nappears as if the entire system had relaxed to a maximum entropy state. In this\nwork, we report the experimental observation of the non-equilibrium dynamics of\na density wave of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice in the regime\nof strong correlations. Using an optical superlattice, we are able to prepare\nthe system in a well-known initial state with high fidelity. We then follow the\ndynamical evolution of the system in terms of quasi-local densities, currents,\nand coherences. Numerical studies based on the time-dependent density-matrix\nrenormalization group method are in an excellent quantitative agreement with\nthe experimental data. For very long times, all three local observables show a\nfast relaxation to equilibrium values compatible with those expected for a\nglobal maximum entropy state. We find this relaxation of the quasi-local\ndensities and currents to initially follow a power-law with an exponent being\nsignificantly larger than for free or hardcore bosons. For intermediate times\nthe system fulfills the promise of being a dynamical quantum simulator, in that\nthe controlled dynamics runs for longer times than present classical algorithms\nbased on matrix product states can efficiently keep track of.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 20:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

For\nexample, a Chiral Lagrangian of Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pions), with or without\nthe Higgs (QCD) UV-completion looks the same in zero momentum limit, but the\nlatter classicalizes in high energy scattering, whereas the former does not.\nThus, theory must make a definite choice, either accept a weakly-coupled\nUV-completion or be classicalized. The UV-awareness that determines the choice\nis encoded in sub-leading structure of effective low-energy action. This\npeculiarity has to do with the fundamental fact that in classicalizing theories\nhigh energies correspond to large distances, due to existence of the extended\nclassical configurations sourced by energy. UV-fate of the theory can be\nparameterized by introducing a concept of a new quantum length-scale,\nde-classicalization radius. Classicalization is abolished when this radius is a\ndominant length. We then observe a possibility of a qualitatively new regime,\nin which a theory classicalizes only within a finite window of energies. We\nsuggest that one possible interpretation of physics above the classicality\nwindow is in terms of a quantum theory of unstable extended objects, analogous,\nfor example, to unstable QCD-type flux tubes. In this picture ordinary QCD can\nbe viewed as a would-be classicalizing theory with collapsed classicality\nwindow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 20:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-14"}

Systematic effects and missing\ninformation in nuclear databases lead to final relative uncertainties in the 10\nto 20% range. A prediction of the antineutrino spectrum associated with the\nfission of 238U is given based on this ab initio method. For the dominant\nisotopes 235U and 239Pu, we developed a more accurate approach combining\ninformation from nuclear databases and reference electron spectra associated\nwith the fission of 235U, 239Pu and 241Pu, measured at ILL in the 80's.

These oscillations induce time varying CP-odd nuclear moments,\nsuch as electric dipole and Schiff moments. The coupling between internal\natomic fields and these nuclear moments gives rise to time varying shifts to\natomic energy levels.

This paper has presented a mechanism for protecting a web-server against\na distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Incoming traffic to the server\nis continuously monitored and any abnormal rise in the inbound traffic is\nimmediately detected. The detection algorithm is based on a statistical\nanalysis of the inbound traffic on the server and a robust hypothesis testing\nframework. While the detection process is on, the sessions from the legitimate\nsources are not disrupted and the load on the server is restored to the normal\nlevel by blocking the traffic from the attacking sources. To cater to different\nscenarios, the detection algorithm has various modules with varying level of\ncomputational and memory overheads for their execution. While the approximate\nmodules are fast in detection and involve less overhead, they have lower\ndetection accuracy. The accurate modules involve complex detection logic and\nhence involve more overhead for their execution, but they have very high\ndetection accuracy.

Here we provide a positive answer for a\ntractable model system: a coupled dimer. After exhaustively enumerating the\nLiouville pathways associated to each peak in the 2D-ES, we argue that by\njudiciously combining the information from a series of experiments varying the\npolarization and frequency components of the pulses, detailed information at\nthe amplitude level about the input and output quantum states at the waiting\ntime can be obtained. This possibility yields a quantum process tomography\n(QPT) of the single-exciton manifold, which completely characterizes the open\nquantum system dynamics through the reconstruction of the process matrix. This\nis the first of a series of two articles. In this manuscript, we specialize our\nresults to the case of a homodimer, where we prove that signals stemming from\ncoherence to population transfer and viceversa vanish upon isotropic averaging,\nand therefore, only a partial QPT is possible in this case. However, this fact\nsimplifies the spectra, and it follows that only two polarization controlled\nexperiments (and no pulse-shaping requirements) suffice to yield the elements\nof the process matrix which survive under isotropic averaging. The angle\nbetween the two site transition dipole moments is self-consistently obtained\nfrom the 2D-ES. Model calculations are presented, as well as an error analysis\nin terms of the angle between the dipoles and peak overlap. In the second\narticle accompanying this study, we numerically exemplify the theory for\nheterodimers and carry out a detailed error analysis for such case.

Replacing\nlarge monolithic DSLAMs with smaller remote DSLAM units closer to customers can\nreduce the energy consumption as well as increase the reach of the access\nnetwork. This paper attempts to formalize the design and optimization of the\n\"last mile\" wireline access network with energy as one of the costs to be\nminimized. In particular, the placement of remote DSLAM units needs to be\noptimized. We propose solutions for two scenarios. For the scenario where an\nexisting all-copper network from the central office to the customers is to be\ntransformed into a fiber-copper network with remote DSLAM units, we present\noptimal polynomial-time solutions.

The proposed approach enables high resolution range,\nangle and Doppler estimation, while transmitting narrowband pulses. The problem\nof joint angle-Doppler-range estimation is first formulated to fit the CS\nframework, i.e., as an L1 optimization problem. Direct solution of this problem\nentails high complexity as it employs a basis matrix whose construction\nrequires discretization of the angle-Doppler-range space. Since high resolution\nrequires fine space discretization, the complexity of joint range, angle and\nDoppler estimation can be prohibitively high. For the case of slowly moving\ntargets, a technique is proposed that achieves significant complexity reduction\nby successively estimating angle-range and Doppler in a decoupled fashion and\nby employing initial estimates obtained via matched filtering to further reduce\nthe space that needs to be digitized. Numerical results show that the\ncombination of CS and SF results in a MIMO radar system that has superior\nresolution and requires far less data as compared to a system that uses a\nmatched filter with SF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 05:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

One\nof the difficulties in CMB experiments is the domination of measured CMB\nanisotropy maps by the Doppler dipole moment from the motion of the antenna\nrelative to the CMB. For each measured temperature the expected dipole\ncomponent has to be calculated separately and then subtracted from the data. A\nsmall error in dipole direction, antenna pointing direction, sidelobe pickup\ncontamination, and/or timing synchronism, can raise significant deviation in\nthe dipole cleaned CMB temperature. After a full-sky observational scan, the\naccumulated deviations will be structured with a pattern closely correlated to\nthe observation pattern with artificial anisotropies on large scales, including\nartificial quadrupole, octopole etc in the final CMB map. Such scan-induced\nanisotropies on large scales can be predicted by the true dipole moment and\nobservational scan scheme. Indeed, the expected scan-induced quadrupole pattern\nof the WMAP mission is perfectly in agreement with the published WMAP\nquadrupole. With the scan strategy of the Planck mission, we predict that\nscan-induced anisotropies will also produce an artificially aligned quadrupole.\nThe scan-induced anisotropy is a common problem for all sweep missions and,\nlike the foreground emissions, has to be removed from observed maps. Without\ndoing so, CMB maps from COBE, WMAP, and Planck as well, are not reliable for\nstudying the CMB anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 06:08:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 03:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-28"}

Error-correcting methods for such a scheme, and their parameters, are\ninvestigated. In particular, the following question is discussed: given the\nside information hypergraph of index coding scheme and the maximal number of\nerroneous symbols $\\delta$, what is the shortest length of a linear index code,\nsuch that every receiver is able to recover the required information? This\nquestion turns out to be a generalization of the problem of finding a\nshortest-length error-correcting code with a prescribed error-correcting\ncapability in the classical coding theory. The Singleton bound and two other\nbounds, referred to as the $\\alpha$-bound and the $\\kappa$-bound, for the\noptimal length of a linear error-correcting index code (ECIC) are established.\nFor large alphabets, a construction based on concatenation of an optimal index\ncode with an MDS classical code, is shown to attain the Singleton bound. For\nsmaller alphabets, however, this construction may not be optimal. A random\nconstruction is also analyzed. It yields another inexplicit bound on the length\nof an optimal linear ECIC.

A WMN comprises of a set of mesh routers\n(MRs) and mesh clients (MCs), where MRs are connected to the Internet backbone\nthrough the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and\ncommunicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the\ninvolvement of MRs. User privacy and security have been primary concerns in\nWMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium,\nstringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to\nsupport real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust,\nreliable and efficient routing protocols so as to minimize the end-to-end\nlatency. Design of a secure and efficient routing protocol for WMNs, therefore,\nis of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable\nrouting protocol that also provides user anonymity in WMNs. The protocol is\nbased on an accurate estimation of the available bandwidth in the wireless\nlinks and a robust estimation of the end-to-end delay in a routing path, and\nminimization of control message overhead. The user anonymity, authentication\nand data privacy is achieved by application of a novel protocol that is based\non Rivest's ring signature scheme. Simulations carried out on the proposed\nprotocol demonstrate that it is more efficient than some of the existing\nrouting protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 09:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Four of the five submm sources\npresent in this field (including the QSO) have counterparts with redshifts\ncompatible with z=1.82. We show that our photometric redshifts are robust\nagainst the use of different spectral templates. We have measured the galaxy\nstellar mass of the submm galaxies from their rest-frame K-band luminosity\nobtaining log(M*/Msun)~11.5+-0.2, slightly larger than the Schechter mass of\npresent day galaxies, and hence indicating that most of the stellar mass is\nalready formed. We present optical-to-radio spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of the five SCUBA sources. The emission of RXJ0941 is dominated by\nreprocessed AGN emission in the observed MIR range, while the starburst\ncontribution completely dominates in the submm range. The SEDs of the other\nthree counterparts are compatible with a dominant starburst contribution above\n~24um, with star formation rates SFR~2000Msun/yr, central dust masses\nlog(Mdust/Msun)~9+-0.5 and hence central gas masses log(Mgas/Msun)~10.7.

The fluctuation theorem provides still another\ndefinition of the temperature, which is shown to coincide with the short time\nvalue of the fluctuation dissipation ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 10:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-30"}

Applications of WSNs are numerous\nand growing, and range from indoor deployment scenarios in the home and office\nto outdoor deployment scenarios in adversary's territory in a tactical\nbattleground (Akyildiz et al., 2002). For military environment, dispersal of\nWSNs into an adversary's territory enables the detection and tracking of enemy\nsoldiers and vehicles. For home/office environments, indoor sensor networks\noffer the ability to monitor the health of the elderly and to detect intruders\nvia a wireless home security system. In each of these scenarios, lives and\nlivelihoods may depend on the timeliness and correctness of the sensor data\nobtained from dispersed sensor nodes. As a result, such WSNs must be secured to\nprevent an intruder from obstructing the delivery of correct sensor data and\nfrom forging sensor data. To address the latter problem, end-to-end data\nintegrity checksums and post-processing of senor data can be used to identify\nforged sensor data (Estrin et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2003a; Ye et al., 2004).\nThe focus of this chapter is on routing security in WSNs. Most of the currently\nexisting routing protocols for WSNs make an optimization on the limited\ncapabilities of the nodes and the application-specific nature of the network,\nbut do not any the security aspects of the protocols. Although these protocols\nhave not been designed with security as a goal, it is extremely important to\nanalyze their security properties. When the defender has the liabilities of\ninsecure wireless communication, limited node capabilities, and possible\ninsider threats, and the adversaries can use powerful laptops with high energy\nand long range communication to attack the network, designing a secure routing\nprotocol for WSNs is obviously a non-trivial task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 10:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-23"}

The most basic\ncombination operators are sum and tensor: while the sum of effects is just\ntheir non-interacting union, the tensor imposes commutation of effects.\nHowever, for effects with unbounded arity, such as continuations or unbounded\nnondeterminism, it is not a priori clear whether these combinations actually\nexist in all cases.

For example, the statement\nthat, for a class S of morphisms in a locally presentable category C of\nstructures, the orthogonal class of objects is a small-orthogonality class\n(hence reflective) is provable in ZFC if S is \\Sigma_1, while it follows from\nthe existence of a proper class of supercompact cardinals if S is \\Sigma_2, and\nfrom the existence of a proper class of what we call C(n)-extendible cardinals\nif S is \\Sigma_{n+2} for n bigger than or equal to 1. These cardinals form a\nnew hierarchy, and we show that Vopenka's principle is equivalent to the\nexistence of C(n)-extendible cardinals for all n. As a consequence, we prove\nthat the existence of cohomological localizations of simplicial sets, a\nlong-standing open problem in algebraic topology, is implied by the existence\nof arbitrarily large supercompact cardinals. This result follows from the fact\nthat cohomology equivalences are \\Sigma_2. In contrast with this fact, homology\nequivalences are \\Sigma_1, from which it follows (as is well known) that the\nexistence of homological localizations is provable in ZFC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 12:47:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 17:39:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2012 08:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2012 12:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

Such a departure from sphericity leads to a bias in the\nderivation of the transit radius from the light curve and affects the\ncomparison with planet structure and evolution models which assume spherical\nsymmetry. As the tidally deformed planet projects its smallest cross section\narea during the transit, the measured effective radius is smaller than the one\nof the unperturbed spherical planet. This effect can be corrected by\ncalculating the theoretical shape of the observed planet.\n  We derive simple analytical expressions for the ellipsoidal shape of a fluid\nobject (star or planet) accounting for both tidal and rotational deformations\nand calibratre it with fully numerical evolution models in the 0.3Mjup-75Mjup\nmass range. Our calculations yield a 20% effect on the transit depth, i.e. a\n10% decrease of the measured radius, for the extreme case of a 1Mjup planet\norbiting a Sun-like star at 0.01AU. For the closest planets detected so far (<\n0.05 AU), the effect on the radius is of the order of 1 to 10%, by no means a\nnegligible effect, enhancing the puzzling problem of the anomalously large\nbloated planets. These corrections must thus be taken into account for a\ncorrect determination of the radius from the transit light curve.\n  Our analytical expressions can be easily used to calculate these corrections,\ndue to the non-spherical shape of the planet, on the observed transit depth and\nthus to derive the planet's real equilibrium radius.

Despite recent work on\nimplementing systems that aim to provide differential privacy, the problem of\nformally verifying that these systems have differential privacy has not been\nadequately addressed. This paper presents the first results towards automated\nverification of source code for differentially private interactive systems. We\ndevelop a formal probabilistic automaton model of differential privacy for\nsystems by adapting prior work on differential privacy for functions. The main\ntechnical result of the paper is a sound proof technique based on a form of\nprobabilistic bisimulation relation for proving that a system modeled as a\nprobabilistic automaton satisfies differential privacy. The novelty lies in the\nway we track quantitative privacy leakage bounds using a relation family\ninstead of a single relation. We illustrate the proof technique on a\nrepresentative automaton motivated by PINQ, an implemented system that is\nintended to provide differential privacy. To make our proof technique easier to\napply to realistic systems, we prove a form of refinement theorem and apply it\nto show that a refinement of the abstract PINQ automaton also satisfies our\ndifferential privacy definition. Finally, we begin the process of automating\nour proof technique by providing an algorithm for mechanically checking a\nrestricted class of relations from the proof technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 14:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

The optimal basis for a given problem (or a given extended\nsource) is not guaranteed. In this paper, we discuss the use of generalized\nprolate spheroidal wave functions as a basis. Given the geometry (or the region\nof interest) of an extended source and the sampling points on the visibility\nplane, we can construct the optimal basis to model the source. Not only does\nthis gives us the minimum number of basis functions required but also the\nartifacts outside the region of interest are minimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 15:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

Using the novel model\nof the confinement phenomenon I argue that the physical reason for the\ncross-over appearance at low baryonic densities is the negative value of QGP\nbag surface tension coefficient. This implies the existence of highly\nnon-spherical or, probably, even fractal surfaces of large and heavy bags at\nand above the cross-over, which, perhaps, can be observed via some\ncorrelations.
