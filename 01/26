Approximate expressions for the\nshort-time evolution of the collisionless rotational shells system are obtained\nusing Vlasov-Poisson perturbation theory in the high-virial limit. The\nagreement between the analytical results and numerical results for finite\nshells systems improves as the number of shells in the system increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 17:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-26"}

The aim of\nthis work is to test whether dust cooling can lead to fragmentation and be\nresponsible for this transition. To investigate this, we make use of\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. We follow the thermodynamic evolution\nof the gas by solving the full thermal energy equation, and also track the\nevolution of the dust temperature and the chemical evolution of the gas.

A recently derived\ninequality showed that this belief is incorrect: one must have order unity\ncorrections to low energy evolution at the horizon (i.e. fuzzballs) to remove\nentanglement between radiation and the hole. In this paper we take several\nmodels of `small corrections' and compute the entanglement entropy numerically;\nin each case this entanglement is seen to monotonically grow, in agreement with\nthe general inequality. We also construct a model of `burning paper', where the\nentanglement is found to rise and then return to zero, in agreement with the\ngeneral arguments of Page. We then note that the fuzzball structure of string\nmicrostates offers a version of `complementarity'. Low energy evolution is\nmodified by order unity, resolving the information problem, while for high\nenergy infalling modes ($E>> kT$) we may be able to replace correlators by\ntheir ensemble averaged values. Israel (and others) have suggested that this\nensemble sum can be represented in the thermo-field-dynamics language as an\nentangled sum over two copies of the system, giving the two sides of the\nextended black hole diagram. Thus high energy correlators in a microstate may\nbe approximated by correlators in a spacetime with horizons, with the ensemble\nsum over microstates acting like the `sewing' prescription of conformal field\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 19:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 18:52:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 00:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The R-C cloud is amongst the most well known of \\HI\\ self-absorbing\n(HISA) regions located at a distance of about 125 pc in the Galactic centre\ndirection. Taking the R-C cloud as an example, we demonstrate that the physical\nproperties of the HISA can be constrained by combining multi-frequency CRRL and\n\\HI\\ observations. The derived physical properties of the HISA cloud are used\nto determine the cooling and heating rates. The dominant cooling process is\nemission of the \\CII\\ 158 \\mum line whereas dominant heating process in the\ncloud interior is photoelectric emission. Constraints on the FUV flux (G0\n$\\sim$ 4 to 7) falling on the R-C cloud are obtained by assuming thermal\nbalance between the dominant heating and cooling processes. The H$_2$ formation\nrate per unit volume in the cloud interior is $\\sim$ 10$^{-10}$ -- 10$^{-12}$\ns$^{-1}$ \\cmthree, which far exceeds the H$_2$ dissociation rate per unit\nvolume.

More\nconcretely, this approach involves Born-Oppenheimer and WKB ansatze and some\naccompanying approximations. In this paper, I investigate this approach for\nconcrete scaled relational particle mechanics models, i.e. models featuring\nonly relative separations, relative angles and relative times. I consider the\nheavy-light interaction term in the light quantum equation - necessary for the\nsemiclassical approach to work, firstly as an emergent-time dependent\nperturbation of the emergent-time-dependent Schrodinger equation for the light\nsubsystem. Secondly, I consider a scheme in which the backreaction is small but\nnon-negligible, so that the l-subsystem also affects the form of the emergent\ntime. I also suggest that the many terms involving expectation values of the\nlight wavefunctions in both the (unapproximated) heavy and light equations\nmight require treatment in parallel to the Hartree--Fock self-consistent\napproach rather than merely being discarded; for the moment this paper provides\na counterexample to such terms being smaller than their unaveraged\ncounterparts.

We develop a\ntoolkit to treat detailed ionization, relaxation, and scattering dynamics for\nan atom within a consistent theoretical framework. The coherent x-ray\nscattering problem including radiation damage is investigated as a function of\nx-ray FEL parameters such as pulse length, fluence, and photon energy. We find\nthat the x-ray scattering intensity saturates at a fluence of ~10^7\nphotons/{\\AA}^2 per pulse, but can be maximized by using a pulse duration much\nshorter than the time scales involved in the relaxation of the inner-shell\nvacancy states created.

In fact,\niron is mainly produced from type Ia supernovae on a timescale of ~ 0.1-1\nbillion years, while the alpha elements come from massive stars on timescales\nof a few tens of million years (Matteucci 1994). Reproducing such a alpha/Fe\ncorrelation has long been a severe problem for cosmological theories of galaxy\nformation, which envisage massive galaxies to assemble gradually from smaller\nprogenitors, and to be characterized by a star formation history too much\nextended towards late cosmic times. While it has recently become clear that\nfeedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity play a role in the late\nquenching of star formation (e.g. Cattaneo et al. 2009), and that early star\nformation history in the galaxy progenitors affect the alpha/Fe ratio (Calura &\nMenci 2009), major mergers alone cannot enhance the star formation in the\nhigh-redshift progenitors to the levels required to match the steepness of the\nobserved alpha/Fe correlation (Spolaor et al. 2010).

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 19:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}

We present numerical\nsimulations of the effect of baryonic mass loss on the structure of a\nspheroidal stellar system, embedded in a dark matter halo. This process,\ninvoked as a possible explanation of the observed size increase of ETGs since z\n\\sim 2, could be caused either by QSO/starburst driven galactic winds, promptly\nejecting from Early Type Galaxies (ETGs) the residual gas and halting star\nformation (galactic winds), or by stellar mass returned to the ISM in the final\nstages of stellar evolution. Indeed, we find that a conceivable loss of about\n50% of the baryonic mass can produce a significant size increase. However, the\npuffing up due to galactic winds occurs when the stellar populations are much\nyounger than the estimated ages >0.5 Gyr of compact high-z ETGs. Therefore,\nwhile it may have had a role in deciding the final structure of ETGs, it cannot\nexplain the evolution observed so far of their size-mass relation; its\nsignature should be searched for in much younger systems.

Comparison between SEM, Auger\nand NanoSIMS analyses showed that these 54Cr-rich regions are associated with\none or more sub-micron (typically less than 200 nm) Cr oxide grains, most\nlikely spinels. Because the size of the NanoSIMS primary O- ion beam is larger\nthan the typical grain size on the sample mount, the measured anomalies are\nlower limits, and we estimate that the actual 54Cr enrichments in three grains\nare at least 11 times Solar and in one of these may be as high as 50 times\nSolar.

In particular,\ndecision-support tools for traffic flow management should aid in limiting\ncontroller workload and complexity, while supporting increases in air traffic\nthroughput. While many decision-support tools exist for short-term traffic\nplanning, few have addressed the strategic needs for medium- and long-term\nplanning for time horizons greater than 30 minutes.

Three types of proximity maps are presented: presence\nmaps that indicate the local density of traffic; conflict maps that determine\nlocations and probabilities of potential conflicts; and outliers maps that\nevaluate the probability of conflict due to aircraft not belonging to dominant\ntraffic patterns. These maps provide traffic flow managers with information\nrelating to the complexity and difficulty of managing an airspace.

Results for\nthe stress-energy tensor, however, suggest that while N_f=2 has a regime where\ndilute matter is non-relativistic and weakly-interacting, N_f=4 matter is\nrelativistic and strongly-interacting for all values of mu above onset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 21:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 11:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-18"}

It is impractical to reobserve all such candidates, so an alternative\napproach was developed in which Bayesian model comparison techniques are used\nto calculate the probability that a candidate is a HZQ, P_q, by combining\nmodels of the quasar and star populations with the photometric measurements of\nthe object. This method was motivated specifically by the large number of HZQ\ncandidates identified by cross-matching the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey\n(UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS) to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS): in the\n~1900 deg^2 covered by the LAS in the UKIDSS Seventh Data Release (DR7) there\nare ~10^3 real astronomical point-sources with the measured colours of the\ntarget quasars, of which only ~10 are expected to be HZQs. Applying Bayesian\nmodel comparison to the sample reveals that most sources with HZQ-like colours\nhave P_q <~ 0.1 and can be confidently rejected without the need for any\nfurther observations. In the case of the UKIDSS DR7 LAS, there were just 88\ncandidates with P_q >= 0.1; these object were prioritized for reobservation by\nranking according to P_q (and their likely redshift, which was also inferred\nfrom the photometric data). Most candidates were rejected after one or two\n(moderate depth) photometric measurements by recalculating P_q using the new\ndata. That left seven confirmed HZQs, three of which were previously identified\nin the SDSS and four of which were new UKIDSS discoveries. The high efficiency\nof this Bayesian selection method suggests that it could usefully be extended\nto other HZQ surveys (e.g. searches by Pan-STARRS or VISTA) as well as to other\nsearches for rare objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 22:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

In this scenario, the number of the quantum field species is so\nlarge that this radiation changes the orbital evolution of a BH binary. We\nderived the correction to the gravitational waveform phase due to this effect\nand estimated the upper bounds on $\\ell$ by performing Fisher analyses. We\nfound that DECIGO/BBO can put a stronger constraint than the current table-top\nresult by detecting gravitational waves from small mass BH/BH and BH/neutron\nstar (NS) binaries.

We also\nderived the upper bound on $\\ell$ from the expected detection number of extreme\nmass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with LISA and BH/NS binaries with DECIGO/BBO,\nextending the discussion made recently by McWilliams.

In the model, the new observations are compared with\nthe templates which have been derived from the previous experiences. In the\nfirst stage, the objects are first represented through a geometric description\nwhich is used for finding the object boundaries and a descriptor which is\ninspired by the human visual system and then they are fed into the model. Next,\nthe new observations are identified through comparing them with the\npreviously-learned templates and are used for producing new templates. The\ncomparisons are made based on measures like Euclidean or correlation distance.\nThe new template is created by applying onion-pealing algorithm. The algorithm\nconsecutively uses convex hulls which are made by the points representing the\nobjects. If the new observation is remarkably similar to one of the observed\ncategories, it is no longer utilized in creating a new template. The existing\ntemplates are used to provide a description of the new observation. This\ndescription is provided in the templates space. Each template represents a\ndimension of the feature space. The degree of the resemblance each template\nbears to each object indicates the value associated with the object in that\ndimension of the templates space. In this way, the description of the new\nobservation becomes more accurate and detailed as the time passes and the\nexperiences increase. We have used this model for learning and recognizing the\nnew polygons in the polygon space. Representing the polygons was made possible\nthrough employing a geometric method and a method inspired by human visual\nsystem. Various implementations of the model have been compared. The evaluation\nresults of the model prove its efficiency in learning and deriving new\ntemplates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 12:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

However, redshifts larger than 5\nare rare for bursts observed by Swift, seemingly contradicting the BATSE\nestimates. The purpose of this article is to clarify this contradiction. We\nderive the cosmological relationships between the observed and emitted\nquantities, and we arrive at a prediction that can be tested on the ensembles\nof bursts with determined redshifts. This analysis is independent on the\nassumed cosmology, on the observational biases, as well as on any gamma-ray\nburst model. Four different samples are studied: 8 BATSE bursts with redshifts,\n13 bursts with derived pseudo-redshifts, 134 Swift bursts with redshifts, and 6\nFermi bursts with redshifts. The controversy can be explained by the fact that\napparently fainter bursts need not, in general, lie at large redshifts. Such a\nbehaviour is possible, when the luminosities (or emitted energies) in a sample\nof bursts increase more than the dimming of the observed values with redshift.\nIn such a case dP(z)/dz > 0 can hold, where P(z) is either the peak-flux or the\nfluence. All four different samples of the long bursts suggest that this is\nreally the case. This also means that the hundreds of faint, long-duration\nBATSE bursts need not lie at high redshifts, and that the observed redshift\ndistribution of long Swift bursts might actually represent the actual\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 12:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

These regions should be tenuous but very hot, and surrounded by a dense\nand cold shocked ISM shell. The interaction between the jet and such a complex\nmedium, also affected by the system proper motion, can lead to very different\njet termination structures. The evolution of the jet termination regions during\nthe life of a high-mass microquasar is simulated to improve the present\nunderstanding of these structures. Also, the evolving emission characteristics\nare modeled to inform potential observational campaigns for this class of\nobject. We have performed 2D numerical simulations of jets propagating in\ndifferent scenarios, corresponding to different epochs after the formation of\nthe high-mass X-ray binary, using the code Ratpenat. We have also made simple\nestimates of the non-thermal emission that could be produced in the jet\ntermination regions. We find that, in the way through the hot and tenuous\nmedium of the shocked wind/SNR ejecta, the jet suffers recollimation shocks in\nwhich it loses part of its thrust and ends in a strong shock inflating a hot\ncocoon. The jet head propagates with a speed similar to the medium sound speed,\nuntil it eventually reaches the denser and colder shocked ISM and the\nunperturbed ISM later on. In these last stages of evolution, the jet is\nsignificantly slowed down and can be disrupted. For relatively old sources, the\nmicroquasar peculiar velocity becomes important, leading to complete jet\ndestruction. Extended non-thermal radiation can be generated in the jet\ntermination regions, being hard X-rays and TeV photons the best suited\nwavelengths to observe these structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 13:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Given\nthe atomic nature of matter, whose behaviour is well described by statistical\nphysics, the second law could not hold unconditionally, but only statistically.\nIt is not an absolute law. As a result of this, in the present paper we try to\nargue that we have not yet any truly cogent argument (known fundamental\nphysical laws) to exclude its possible macroscopic violation. Even Landauer's\ninformation-theoretic principle seems to fall short of the initial expectations\nof being the fundamental `physical' reason of all Maxwell's demons failure.\nHere we propose a modified Szilard engine which operates without any steps in\nthe process resembling the creation or destruction of information. We argue\nthat the information-based exorcisms must be wrong, or at the very least\nsuperfluous, and that the real physical reason why such engines cannot work\nlies in the ubiquity of thermal fluctuations (and friction).\n  We see in the above peculiar features the main motivation and rationale for\npursuing exploratory research to challenge the second law, which is still\nongoing and probably richer than ever.

Starting with these definitions, we\nnumerically generate evolved TMD PDFs and TMD FFs using as input existing\nparametrizations for the collinear PDFs, collinear FFs, non-perturbative\nfactors in the CSS factorization formalism, and recent fixed-scale fits. We\nconfirm that evolution has important consequences, both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, and argue that it should be included in future phenomenological\nstudies of TMD functions.

Based on previous studies, we reanalyzed this\nbreak-off event, with the help of a new numerical model, initially developed by\nFaillettaz and others (2010) for gravity-driven instabilities. The simulations\nindicate that a break-off event is only possible when the basal friction at the\nbedrock is reduced in a restricted area, possibly induced by the storage of\ninfiltrated water within the glacier. Moreover, our simulations reveal a\ntwo-step behavior: (i) A first quiescent phase, without visible changes, with a\nduration depending on the rate of basal changes; (ii) An active phase with a\nrapid increase of basal motion over a few days. The general lesson obtained\nfrom the comparison between the simulations and the available evidence is that\nvisible signs of the destabilization process of a hanging glacier, resulting\nfrom a progressive warming of the ice/bed interface towards a temperate regime,\nwill appear just a few days prior to the collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 14:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

The proposed observable can be experimentally measured in exactly the\nsame easy manner as that of the entanglement witness, moreover a quantum\ncircuit is designed to determine the expectation value of our observable with\nfour simultaneous local qubit-measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 14:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 12:57:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 09:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This method involves binning the data in the radial direction so as to\nextract the most general possible non-parametric kinematic profiles, and using\na maximum likelihood fit within each bin in order to make full use of the\ninformation in the discrete kinematic tracers. Both disk and spheroid kinematic\ncomponents are fitted, with a two-dimensional decomposition of imaging data\nused to attribute to each tracer a probability of membership in the separate\ncomponents. Likelihood clipping also allows us to identify objects whose\nproperties are not consistent with the adopted model, rendering the technique\nrobust against contaminants and able to identify additional kinematic features.\n  The method is first tested on an N-body simulated galaxy to assess possible\nsources of systematic error associated with the structural and kinematic\ndecomposition, which are found to be small. It is then applied to the S0 system\nNGC~1023, for which a planetary nebula catalogue has already been released and\nanalyzed by (Noordermeer et al., 2008). The correct inclusion of the spheroidal\ncomponent allows us to show that, contrary to previous claims, the stellar\nkinematics of this galaxy are indistinguishable from those of a normal spiral\ngalaxy, indicating that it may have evolved directly from such a system via gas\nstripping or secular evolution. The method also successfully identifies a\npopulation of outliers whose kinematics are different from those of the main\ngalaxy; these objects can be identified with a stellar stream associated with\nthe companion galaxy NGC~1023A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 15:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We also present that for the selected model under thermal\nequilibrium with the Hawking radiation, the GSL is always satisfied throughout\nthe history of the universe for any spatial curvature, independently of the\nequation of state of the interacting generalized Chaplygin gas model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 11:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}
