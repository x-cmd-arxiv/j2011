The three fields observed as part of the Herschel science\ndemonstration phase (SDP) provided the first glimpse into the nature of these\nsources. We examine the properties of the dust emission within the fields. We\ndetermine the dust sub-millimetre opacity, look for signs of spatial variations\nin the dust spectral index, and estimate how the apparent variations of the\nparameters could be affected by different sources of uncertainty. We use the\nHerschel observations where the zero point of the surface brightness scale is\nset with the help of the Planck satellite data. We derive the colour\ntemperature and column density maps of the regions and determine the dust\nopacity by a comparison with extinction measurements. By simultaneously fitting\nthe colour temperature and the dust spectral index values we look for spatial\nvariations in the apparent dust properties. With a simple radiative transfer\nmodel we estimate to what extent these can be explained by line-of-sight\ntemperature variations, without changes in the dust grain properties. The\nanalysis of the dust emission reveals cold and dense clouds that coincide with\nthe Planck sources and confirm those detections. The derived dust opacity\nvaries in the range kappa(250um) ~ 0.05-0.2 cm^2/g, higher values being\nobserved preferentially in regions of high column density. The average dust\nspectral index beta is ~ 1.9-2.2. There are indications that beta increases\ntowards the coldest regions. The spectral index decreases strongly near\ninternal heating sources but, according to radiative transfer models, this can\nbe explained by the line-of-sight temperature variations without a change in\nthe dust properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2011 16:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Numerical tests\ndemonstrate that the theoretical stability properties are valid in practice\nwith negligible compromises to accuracy. The result is a highly robust scheme\nwith state-of-the-art efficiency. The scheme's robustness is due to entropy\nstability, positivity and properly discretised Powell terms. The implementation\ntakes the form of a modification of the MHD module in the FLASH code, an\nadaptive mesh refinement code. We compare the new scheme with the standard\nFLASH implementation for MHD. Results show comparable accuracy to standard\nFLASH with the Roe solver, but highly improved efficiency and stability,\nparticularly for high Mach number flows and low plasma beta.

Hess measured the rate of discharge of an electroscope\nthat flew aboard an atmospheric balloon. Because the discharge rate increased\nas the balloon flew at higher altitude, he concluded in 1912 that the origin\ncould not be terrestrial. For this discovery, Hess was awarded the Nobel Prize\nin 1936, and his experiment became legendary. At the same time, in 1911,\nPacini, a professor at the University of Bari, made a series of measurements to\ndetermine the variation in the speed of discharge of an electroscope (and thus\nthe intensity of the radiation) while the electroscope was immersed in a box in\na sea near the Naval Academy in the Bay of Livorno (the Italian Navy supported\nthe research). Pacini discovered that the discharge of the oscilloscope was\nsignificantly slower than at the surface.\n  Before his conclusive measurements, Pacini performed a series of experiments\nbetween 1907 and 1910, in particular by comparing radioactivity on ground and\non the sea surface a few kilometers off the coast.

A dynamically important magnetic field presents a\nsignificant obstacle to the formation of protostellar disks. Recent studies\nhave shown that magnetic braking is strong enough to suppress the formation of\nrotationally supported disks in the ideal MHD limit. Whether non-ideal MHD\neffects can enable disk formation remains unsettled. We carry out a first study\non how disk formation in magnetic clouds is modified by the Hall effect, the\nleast explored of the three non-ideal MHD effects in star formation (the other\ntwo being ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation). For illustrative\npurposes, we consider a simplified problem of a non-self-gravitating,\nmagnetized envelope collapsing onto a central protostar of fixed mass. We find\nthat the Hall effect can spin up the inner part of the collapsing flow to\nKeplerian speed, producing a rotationally supported disk. The disk is generated\nthrough a Hall-induced magnetic torque. Disk formation occurs even when the\nenvelope is initially non-rotating, provided that the Hall coefficient is large\nenough. When the magnetic field orientation is flipped, the direction of disk\nrotation is reversed as well. The implication is that the Hall effect can in\nprinciple produce both regularly rotating and counter-rotating disks around\nprotostars. We conclude that the Hall effect is an important factor to consider\nin studying the angular momentum evolution of magnetized star formation in\ngeneral and disk formation in particular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2011 19:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The evolution of virulence\nin viral populations is, however, poorly understood. Based on the experimental\nobservation of an RNA virus clone in cell culture diversifying into two\nsubpopulations of different virulence, we study the dynamics of heterogeneous\nvirus populations and the evolution of virulence. We introduce a\ncompetition-colonization trade-off into standard mathematical models of\nintra-host viral infection. Colonizers are fast spreading, virulent strains,\nwhereas competitors are less virulent variants that are more successful within\ncoinfected cells. We observe biphasic dynamics of the population: Early in the\ninfection the population is dominated by colonizers, which later will be\noutcompeted by competitors. The simulations suggest the existence of a steady\nstate where few low-virulence variants coexist. This equilibrium implies\ncollective virulence attenuation in the population, in contrast to previous\nmodels predicting development of the population towards increased virulence.\nNevertheless, the attenuation effect disappears if we include a highly\nsimplified immune response in our models. Thus, the competition-colonization\ntrade-off indicates a role for virulence in the modulation of the viral\npopulation diversity. The evolution of virulence is a dynamic feature of the\npopulation shaped by interactions between individuals and by the structure of\nthe patchy habitat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2011 12:27:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 13:45:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 22:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The\nmain cause for this discrepancy is the fact that programming sensor nodes still\nhappens at a very technical level. We remedy the situation by introducing\nWiselib, our algorithm library that allows for simple implementations of\nalgorithms onto a large variety of hardware and software. This is achieved by\nemploying advanced C++ techniques such as templates and inline functions,\nallowing to write generic code that is resolved and bound at compile time,\nresulting in virtually no memory or computation overhead at run time.\n  The Wiselib runs on different host operating systems, such as Contiki, iSense\nOS, and ScatterWeb. Furthermore, it runs on virtual nodes simulated by Shawn.\nFor any algorithm, the Wiselib provides data structures that suit the specific\nproperties of the target platform. Algorithm code does not contain any\nplatform-specific specializations, allowing a single implementation to run\nnatively on heterogeneous networks.\n  In this paper, we describe the building blocks of the Wiselib, and analyze\nthe overhead.

The motivation of our study is\nto quantitatively understand the impact of theoretical input, in particular the\ndynamical critical exponent z, in calculating the critical exponent nu. Hence\nwe have carried out four sets of simulations with beta = 2N^{1/2}, beta =\n8N^{1/2}, beta = N/2, and beta = N/4, respectively. Here beta is the inverse\ntemperature and N is the numbers of lattice sites used in the simulations. By\napplying data collapse to the observable superfluid density rho_{s2} in the\nsecond spatial direction, we confirm that the transition is indeed governed by\nthe superfluid-insulator universality class. However we find it is subtle to\ndetermine the precise location of the critical point. For example, while the\ncritical chemical potential (mu/V)_c occurs at (mu/V)_c = 2.3239(3) for the\ndata obtained using beta = 2N^{1/2}, the (mu/V)_c determined from the data\nsimulated with beta = N/2 is found to be (mu/V)_c = 2.3186(2). Further, while a\ngood data collapse for rho_{s2}N can be obtained with the data determined using\nbeta = N/4 in the simulations, a reasonable quality of data collapse for the\nsame observable calculated from another set of simulations with beta = 8N^{1/2}\ncan hardly be reached. Surprisingly, assuming z for this phase transition is\ndetermined to be 2 first in a Monte Carlo calculation, then a high quality data\ncollapse for rho_{s2}N can be achieved for (mu/V)_c ~ 2.3184 and nu ~ 0.7 using\nthe data obtained with beta = 8N^{1/2}.

Besides, we obtain that the time-depended\n2-angles solutions exist if the axis of preferential direction of wave\npropagation is similar to the time arrow in mechanical processes. The other\npossibility is the appropriate phase-shifting of the time-depended solutions. A\nparaxial type approximation is obtained for the solution in the limit in which\nthe polar angle approaches zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2011 15:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 20:24:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 14:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 11:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Generally the users require only certain aggregate\nfunctions of this distributed data. Computation of this aggregate data under\nthe end-to-end information flow paradigm by communicating all the relevant data\nto a central collector node is a highly inefficient solution for this purpose.\nAn alternative proposition is to perform in-network computation. This, however,\nraises questions such as: what is the optimal way to compute an aggregate\nfunction from a set of statistically correlated values stored in different\nnodes; what is the security of such aggregation as the results sent by a\ncompromised or faulty node in the network can adversely affect the accuracy of\nthe computed result. In this paper, we have presented an energy-efficient\naggregation algorithm for WSNs that is secure and robust against malicious\ninsider attack by any compromised or faulty node in the network. In contrast to\nthe traditional snapshot aggregation approach in WSNs, a node in the proposed\nalgorithm instead of unicasting its sensed information to its parent node,\nbroadcasts its estimate to all its neighbors. This makes the system more\nfault-tolerant and increase the information availability in the network. The\nsimulations conducted on the proposed algorithm have produced results that\ndemonstrate its effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2011 15:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-18"}
