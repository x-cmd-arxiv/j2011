Twenty-five candidates have been observed to date using snapshot\n(~10 ksec) exposures, ten as part of a pilot programme to sample a low range of\nsignal-to-noise ratios (4<S/N<6), and a further 15 in a programme to observe a\nsample of S/N>5 candidates. The sensitivity and spatial resolution of\nXMM-Newton allows unambiguous discrimination between clusters and false\ncandidates. The 4 false candidates have S/N <= 4.1. A total of 21 candidates\nare confirmed as extended X-ray sources. Seventeen are single clusters, the\nmajority of which are found to have highly irregular and disturbed morphologies\n(about ~70%). The remaining four sources are multiple systems, including the\nunexpected discovery of a supercluster at z=0.45. For 20 sources we are able to\nderive a redshift estimate from the X-ray Fe K line (albeit of variable\nquality). The new clusters span the redshift range 0.09 <= z <= 0.54, with a\nmedian redshift of z~0.37. A first determination is made of their X-ray\nproperties including the characteristic size, which is used to improve the\nestimate of the SZ Compton parameter, Y_SZ.

We use 21-cm observations of HI as a tracer\nof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of Galactic dust\nemission and use the 143 GHz Planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmic\nmicrowave background anisotropies. Both of these cleaning processes are\nnecessary to avoid significant contamination of the CIB signal. We measure\ncorrelated CIB structure across frequencies. As expected, the correlation\ndecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution of\nhigh-redshift galaxies to CIB anisotropies increases with wavelengths. We find\nno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the CIB\nanisotropies and the CIB mean, with Delta I/I=15% from 217 to 857 GHz. In terms\nof clustering properties, the Planck data alone rule out the linear scale- and\nredshift-independent bias model. Non-linear corrections are significant.\nConsequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,\nparametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. It provides an\nexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggests\nthat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,\nwhich is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated by\ncontributions from different redshifts. In our best-fit model, half of the\nanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z<0.8 at 857 GHz and z<1.5 at\n545 GHz, while about 90% come from redshifts z>2 at 353 and 217 GHz,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 18:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 09:25:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 07:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The optical depth\nmaps are correlated to tracers of the atomic and molecular gas. The correlation\nis linear in the lowest column density regions at high galactic latitudes. At\nhigh NH, the correlation is consistent with that of the lowest NH. In the\nintermediate NH range, we observe departure from linearity, with the dust\noptical depth in excess to the correlation. We attribute this excess emission\nto thermal emission by dust associated with a Dark-Gas phase, undetected in the\navailable HI and CO measurements. We show the 2D spatial distribution of the\nDark-Gas in the solar neighborhood and show that it extends around known\nmolecular regions traced by CO. The average dust emissivity in the HI phase in\nthe solar neighborhood follows roughly a power law distribution with beta = 1.8\nall the way down to 3 mm, although the SED flattens slightly in the millimetre.\nThe threshold for the existence of the Dark-Gas is found at NH = (8.0\\pm 0.58)\n10^{20} Hcm-2. Assuming the same dust emissivity at high frequencies for the\ndust in the atomic and molecular phases leads to an average XCO = (2.54\\pm0.13)\n10^{20} H2cm-2/(K km s-1). The mass of Dark-Gas is found to be 28% of the\natomic gas and 118% of the CO emitting gas in the solar neighborhood. A\npossible origin for the Dark-Gas is the existence of a dark molecular phase,\nwhere H2 survives photodissociation but CO does not. The observed transition\nfor the onset of this phase in the solar neighborhood (AV = 0.4 mag) appears\nconsistent with recent theoretical predictions. We also discuss the possibility\nthat up to half of the Dark-Gas could be in atomic form, due to optical depth\neffects in the HI measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 18:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

Using Planck maps and multi-frequency\nancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known AME regions: the\nPerseus and Rho Ophiuchi molecular clouds. The spectra are well fitted by a\ncombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,\nand electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. The spinning\ndust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the high\nfrequency side clearly for the first time. The spectra have a peak in the range\n20-40 GHz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for Perseus and\n8.4 sigma for Rho Ophiuchi. In Perseus, spinning dust in the dense molecular\ngas can account for most of the AME; the low density atomic gas appears to play\na minor role. In Rho Ophiuchi, the ~30 GHz peak is dominated by dense molecular\ngas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 GHz,\nwhich can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. The dust\nparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. We have\nalso searched the Planck map at 28.5 GHz for candidate AME regions, by\nsubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust.

The\nobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases of\nthe interstellar medium (ISM). We have separated the observed Galactic emission\ninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in each\nof a number of Galactocentric rings. Templates are created for various\nGalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)\nand molecular (12CO) observations. The ionised template is assumed to be traced\nby free-free emission as observed by WMAP, while 408 MHz emission is used to\ntrace the synchrotron component. Gas emission not traced by the above\ntemplates, namely \"ark gas\", as evidenced using Planck data, is included as an\nadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.\nThese templates are then correlated with each of the Planck frequency bands, as\nwell as other ancillary data. The emission per column density of the gas\ntemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) per\nGalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 GHz to 25 THz\n(12\\mu m). Apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probed\nthe Galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.\nWe show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular and\ndark gas phases throughout the Galactic disk. The derived dust propeties\nassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to reveal\nthe nature of this phase. For all environments, the anomalous emission is\nconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and,\naccording to our simple model, accounts for $(25\\pm5)%$ (statistical) of the\ntotal emission at 30 GHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 18:41:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 15:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 14:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We also describe the statistics of\nthe Early Cold Core Catalogue (ECC, delivered with the Early Release Compact\nSource Catalogue, ERCSC) that is the subset of the 915 most reliable detections\nof the complete catalogue. We have used the CoCoCoDeT algorithm to extract\n10783 cold sources. Temperature and dust emission spectral index {\\beta} values\nare derived using the fluxes in the IRAS 100 \\mum band and the three highest\nfrequency Planck bands. Temperature spans from 7K to 17K, and peaks around 13K.\nData are not consistent with a constant value of {\\beta} over the all\ntemperature range. {\\beta} ranges from 1.4 to 2.8 with a mean value around 2.1,\nand several possible scenarios are possible, including {\\beta}(T) and the\neffect of multiple T components folded into the measurements. For one third of\nthe objects the distances are obtained. Most of the detections are within 2 kpc\nin the Solar neighbourhood, but a few are at distances greater than 4 kpc. The\ncores are distributed from the deep Galactic plane, despite the confusion, to\nhigh latitudes (>30$^{\\circle}$). The associated mass estimates range from 1 to\n$10^5$ solar masses. Using their physical properties these cold sources are\nshown to be cold clumps, defined as the intermediate cold sub-structures\nbetween clouds and cores. These cold clumps are not isolated but mostly\norganized in filaments associated with molecular clouds. The Cold Core\nCatalogue of Planck Objects (C3PO) is the first unbiased all-sky catalogue of\ncold objects.

Galactic dust emission for\nfields with average HI column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is well\ncorrelated with 21-cm emission. The residual emission in these fields, once the\nHI-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statistical\nproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. Fields with larger\ncolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the HI\ncolumn density. Regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest the\npresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlated\nwith CO emission. Dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detected\nwith high significance. Its spectral properties are consistent with, compared\nto the local ISM values, significantly hotter dust (T~20 K), lower\nsub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains to\nlarge grains about four times higher. These results are compatible with\nexpectations for clouds that are part of the Galactic fountain in which there\nis dust shattering and fragmentation. Correlated dust emission in HVCs is not\ndetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is\n0.15 times the local ISM value at 857 and 3000 GHz, in accordance with gas\nphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. Unexpected\nanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-section\nper H atom are identified in the local ISM and IVCs, a trend that continues\ninto molecular environments. This suggests that dust growth through\naggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloud\ncondensation and star formation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 18:41:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 22:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We present an early analysis of the Taurus molecular complex, on\nline-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. The emission\nspectrum measured by Planck and IRAS can be fitted pixel by pixel using a\nsingle modified blackbody. Some systematic residuals are detected at 353 GHz\nand 143 GHz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicating\nthat the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modified\nblackbody. Significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecular\nregions and in the 217 GHz and 100 GHz bands, mainly caused by to the\ncontribution of the J=2-1 and J=1-0 12CO and 13CO emission lines. We derive\nmaps of the dust temperature T, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, and\nthe dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. The temperature map illustrates the\ncooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incident\nradiation field, from 16-17 K in the diffuse regions to 13-14 K in the dense\nparts. The distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standard\ndeviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. We detect a significant\nT-beta anti-correlation. The dust optical depth map reveals the spatial\ndistribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densest\nmolecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. We use near-infrared extinction\nand HI data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatial\nvariations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atom\ntau/NH. We report an increase of tau/NH by a factor of about 2 between the\natomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on the\nequilibrium temperature of the dust particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 18:41:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 16:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 16:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 15:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The catalogue is based on data that consist of\nmapping the entire sky once and 60% of the sky a second time by Planck, thereby\ncomprising the first high sensitivity radio/submillimetre observations of the\nentire sky. A Monte-Carlo algorithm based on the injection and extraction of\nartificial sources into the Planck maps was implemented to select reliable\nsources among all extracted candidates such that the cumulative reliability of\nthe catalogue is >=90%. The 10sigma photometric flux density limit of the\ncatalogue at |b|>30 deg is 0.49, 1.0, 0.67, 0.5, 0.33, 0.28, 0.25, 0.47 and\n0.82 Jy at each of the nine frequencies between 30 and 857 GHz. Sources which\nare up to a factor of ~2 fainter than this limit, and which are present in\n\"clean\" regions of the Galaxy where the sky background due to emission from the\ninterstellar medium is low, are included in the ERCSC if they meet the high\nreliability criterion. The Planck ERCSC sources have known associations to\nstars with dust shells, stellar cores, radio galaxies, blazars, infrared\nluminous galaxies and Galactic interstellar medium features. A significant\nfraction of unclassified sources are also present in the catalogs. In addition,\ntwo early release catalogs that contain 915 cold molecular cloud core\ncandidates and 189 SZ cluster candidates that have been generated using\nmulti-frequency algorithms are presented. The entire source list, with more\nthan 15000 unique sources, is ripe for follow-up characterisation with\nHerschel, ATCA, VLA, SOFIA, ALMA and other ground-based observing facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 18:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 22:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

The\nsample comprises ~ 1600 X-ray clusters with redshifts up to ~ 1 and spans a\nwide range in X-ray luminosity. The SZ signal is extracted for each object\nindividually, and the statistical significance of the measurement is maximised\nby averaging the SZ signal in bins of X-ray luminosity, total mass, or\nredshift. The SZ signal is detected at very high significance over more than\ntwo decades in X-ray luminosity (10^43 erg/s < L_500 E(z)^-7/3 < 2 X 10^45\nerg/s). The relation between intrinsic SZ signal and X-ray luminosity is\ninvestigated and the measured SZ signal is compared to values predicted from\nX-ray data.

No significant\ndeviation from standard evolution of the scaling relations is detected. For the\nfirst time the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between SZ signal and\nX-ray luminosity is measured and found to be consistent with the one in the\nluminosity -- mass relation from X-ray studies.

We here present the first results on the properties of nearby\ngalaxies using these data. We match the ERCSC catalogue to IRAS-detected\ngalaxies in the Imperial IRAS Faint Source Redshift Catalogue (IIFSCz), so that\nwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these objects from\n60 to 850 microns. This produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliable\nassociations between Planck and IRAS, from which we select a subset of 468 for\nSED studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequency\nPlanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. The SEDs are fitted using\nparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures and\nemissivities. We find evidence for colder dust than has previously been found\nin external galaxies, with T<20K. Such cold temperatures are found using both\nthe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or a\ntwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. We also compare our results to\nstudies of distant submm galaxies (SMGs) which have been claimed to contain\ncooler dust than their local counterparts. We find that including our sample of\n468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.\nFits to SEDs of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derived\nfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust found\nthrough parameteric fitting. We thus conclude that cold (T<20K) dust is a\nsignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 18:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

The origin of this millimetre excess is\nstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the Planck data. The\nbackground CMB contribution is subtracted using an ILC method performed locally\naround the galaxies. The foreground emission from the Milky Way is subtracted.\nAfter subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with the\ngas emission of the LMC and SMC. The millimetre excess in the LMC can be\nexplained by CMB fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in the\nSMC SED. The Planck and IRIS data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermal\ndust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. The LMC\ntemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with the\nSpitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified cold\nouter arm. Several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which are\nassociated with known molecular clouds. The average emissivity spectral index\nis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for the\nLMC and SMC respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in the\nMilky Way. Furthermore, there is evidence in the SMC for a further flattening\nof the SED in the sub-mm. The spatial distribution of the millimetre dust\nexcess in the SMC follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. Different\nmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the SMC.

The nine Planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 GHz, are\ncomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio to\ngamma-rays. This is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio and\nmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radio\nsources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase of\ndevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. The\nSEDs presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degree\npolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse Compton\n(IC) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,\nincluding the Planck ERCSC data, were calculated. SED modelling methods are\ndiscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotron\nbump using multiplecomponents. Planck ERCSC data also suggest that the original\naccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonly\nthought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. The\nimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective in\nblazar shock. Furthermore in many cases the Planck data indicate that gamma-ray\nemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 18:41:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 10:29:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 12:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

However, as more Earth-like planets are discovered around\nlow-mass stars (LMSs), a re-examination of the role of tides on the\nhabitability of exoplanets has begun. Those studies have yet to consider the\nmisalignment between a planet's rotational axis and the orbital plane normal,\ni.e. the planetary obliquity. We apply two equilibrium tide theories to compute\nthe obliquity evolution of terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones\naround LMSs. The time for the obliquity to decrease from an Earth-like\nobliquity of 23.5 deg to 5 deg, the 'tilt erosion time', is compared to the\ntraditional insolation habitable zone (IHZ) as a function of semi-major axis,\neccentricity, and stellar mass. We also compute tidal heating and equilibrium\nrotation caused by obliquity tides. The Super-Earth Gl581d and the planet\ncandidate Gl581g are studied as examples for tidal processes. Earth-like\nobliquities of terrestrial planets in the IHZ around <0.25 solar mass (M_sun)\nstars are eroded in <0.1 Gyr. Only terrestrial planets orbiting stars with\nmasses >0.9 M_sun experience tilt erosion times larger than 1 Gyr throughout\nthe IHZ. Terrestrial planets in the IHZ of stars with masses <0.25 M_sun\nundergo significant tidal heating due to obliquity tides. The predictions of\nthe two tidal models diverge significantly for e>0.3. In our two-body\nsimulations, Gl581d's obliquity is eroded to 0 and its rotation period reached\nits equilibrium state of half its orbital period in <0.1 Gyr. Tidal surface\nheating on the putative Gl581g is <150 mW/m^2 as long as its eccentricity is\n<0.3. Obliquity tides modify the concept of the habitable zone. Tilt erosion of\nterrestrial planets orbiting LMSs should be included by atmospheric modelers.\nTidal heating needs to be considered by geologists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 16:22:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2011 15:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

A\nlinearized model of the response is derived, and a linear quadratic regulator\n(LQR) has been designed. Using the TCL setpoint as the control input, the LQR\nenables aggregate power to track reference signals that exhibit step, ramp and\nsinusoidal variations.

As a\nquantum theory the conformal theory is both renormalizable and unitary, with\nunitarity being obtained because the theory is a $PT$ symmetric rather than a\nHermitian theory. We show that in the theory there can be no a priori classical\ncurvature, with all curvature having to result from quantization. In the\nconformal theory gravity requires no independent quantization of its own, with\nit being quantized solely by virtue of its being coupled to a quantized matter\nsource. Moreover, because it is this very coupling that fixes the strength of\nthe gravitational field commutators, the gravity sector zero-point energy\ndensity and pressure fluctuations are then able to identically cancel the\nzero-point fluctuations associated with the matter sector. In addition, we show\nthat when the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, the zero-point\nstructure automatically readjusts so as to identically cancel the cosmological\nconstant term that dynamical mass generation induces. We show that the\nmacroscopic classical theory that results from the quantum conformal theory\nincorporates global physics effects that provide for a detailed accounting of a\ncomprehensive set of 138 galactic rotation curves with no adjustable parameters\nother than the galactic mass to light ratios, and with the need for no dark\nmatter whatsoever. With these global effects eliminating the need for dark\nmatter, we see that invoking dark matter in galaxies could potentially be\nnothing more than an attempt to describe global physics effects in purely local\ngalactic terms. Finally, we review some recent work by 't Hooft in which a\nconnection between conformal gravity and Einstein gravity has been found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 19:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 17:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

However, our detailed knowledge of nuclear\nforces and the mechanisms governing the structure of nuclei, in particular far\nfrom stability, is still incomplete. In nuclei with equal neutron and proton\nnumbers ($N = Z$), the unique nature of the atomic nucleus as an object\ncomposed of two distinct types of fermions can be expressed as enhanced\ncorrelations arising between neutrons and protons occupying orbitals with the\nsame quantum numbers. Such correlations have been predicted to favor a new type\nof nuclear superfluidity; isoscalar neutron-proton pairing, in addition to\nnormal isovector pairing (see Fig. 1). Despite many experimental efforts these\npredictions have not been confirmed. Here, we report on the first observation\nof excited states in $N = Z = 46$ nucleus $^{92}$Pd.

Therefore, if a gauge force is concentrated\nover a small cycle it will not be diluted over the entire manifold. Gravity,\nhowever, remains diluted over the large volume.

These variations have been\ninterpreted as evidence for multiple star formation episodes within GCs, with\nsecondary episodes fueled, at least in part, by the ejecta of AGB stars from a\nfirst generation of stars. A major puzzle emerging from this otherwise\nplausible scenario is that the fraction of stars associated with the second\nepisode of star formation is observed to be much larger than expected for a\nstandard IMF. The present work investigates this tension by modeling the\nobserved anti-correlation between [Na/Fe] and [O/Fe] for 20 Galactic GCs. If\nthe abundance pattern of the retained AGB ejecta does not depend on GC mass at\nfixed [Fe/H], then a strong correlation is found between the fraction of\ncurrent GC stellar mass comprised of pure AGB ejecta, f_p, and GC mass. This\nfraction varies from 0.20 at low masses (10^4.5 Msun) to 0.45 at high masses\n(10^6.5 Msun). The fraction of mass associated with pure AGB ejecta is directly\nrelated to the total mass of the cluster at birth; the ratio between the\ninitial and present mass in stars can therefore be derived. Assuming a star\nformation efficiency of 50%, the observed Na-O anti-correlations imply that GCs\nwere at least 10-20 times more massive at birth. These factors are lower limits\nbecause any mass-loss mechanism that removes first and second generation stars\nequally will leave f_p unchanged. The mass-dependence of f_p probably arises\nbecause lower mass GCs are unable to retain all of the AGB ejecta from the\nfirst stellar generation. Recent observations of elemental abundances in\nintermediate-age LMC clusters are re-interpreted and shown to be consistent\nwith this basic scenario. A convincing explanation of these trends is currently\nlacking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 21:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 18:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The\nstudy is based on numerical simulations with the RADYN code, which includes\nhydrodynamics, radiative transfer, and a detailed non-equilibrium treatment of\nhydrogen, calcium, and helium. The simulations are characterised by upwards\npropagating shock waves, which cause strong temperature fluctuations and\nvariations of the ionisation degree of calcium. The passage of a hot shock\nfront leads to a strong net ionisation of Ca II, rapidly followed by net\nrecombination. The relaxation timescale of the Ca ionisation state is found to\nbe of the order of a few seconds at the top of the photosphere and 10 to 30 s\nin the upper chromosphere. Generally, the timescales are significantly reduced\nin the wakes of hot shock fronts. The timescales can be reliably determined\nfrom a simple analysis of the eigenvalues of the transition rate matrix. The\ntimescales are dominated by the radiative recombination from Ca III into the\nmetastable Ca II energy levels of the 4d 2D term. These transitions depend\nstrongly on the density of free electrons and therefore on the\n(non-equilibrium) ionisation degree of hydrogen, which is the main electron\ndonor. The ionisation/recombination timescales derived here are too long for\nthe assumption of an instantaneous ionisation equilibrium to be valid and, on\nthe other hand, are not long enough to warrant an assumption of a constant\nionisation fraction. Fortunately, the ionisation degree of Ca II remains small\nin the height range, where the cores of the H, K, and the infrared triplet\nlines are formed.

The drivers' route choices are affected\nby their, relatively infrequent, perturbed best responses to global information\nabout the current network congestion levels, as well as their instantaneous\nlocal observation of the immediate surroundings as they transit through the\nnetwork.

In Drosophila oocytes,\nmicrotubules have been observed to undergo undulating motion, curving to form\ntravelling waves during cytoplasmic streaming. Here we show that this wave-like\nmotion can be understood physically as due to the hydrodynamic drag of\nstreaming impellers attached to kinesin motors moving toward the plus-ends of\nmicrotubules whose minus ends are anchored to the cell cortex. The tangential\nforces applied to such microtubules by kinesin give rise to bending and leads\nto chiral symmetry breaking causing the microtubules to propagate long\ntravelling waves. The waves are reminiscent of those seen in flagellar motion\nbut of a much longer time scale and by a different physical mechanism. We show\nhow kinesin movement can produce a bulk flow of cytoplasm surrounding a\nmicrotubule with the range of flow greatly enhanced by the effect of\nhydrodynamic coupling between impellers. That is, a relatively small number of\nmotors can move a large amount of fluid. The chaotic nature of the fluid motion\nof cytoplasm caused by kinesin movement along constantly changing microtubule\ntrajectories is important as it greatly enhances the efficiency of mixing.\nExisting data on in vitro microtubule gliding assays also show this chiral\ninstability in two dimensions and an analysis of this gives quantitative\nestimates for the forces exerted by motors and the drag coefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 22:03:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 02:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-11"}

After a\ndiscussion of classical constructions in Wick form, we derive an explicit set\nof relations obtained from the virtual geometry of the moduli space of stable\nquotients. In a series of steps, the stable quotient relations are transformed\nto simpler and simpler forms. Our final result establishes a previously\nconjectural set of tautological relations proposed a decade ago by\nFaber-Zagier.\n  The Faber-Zagier relations are defined using g and a single series in one\nvariable with coefficients (6i)!/(3i)!(2i)!. Whether these relations span the\ncomplete set of relations among the kappa classes on the moduli space of genus\ng curves is an interesting question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 23:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-13"}

The evolution is pursed with a fourth-order Hermite\nscheme, where not only three-body interaction of MBHs but also dynamical\nfriction by stars are incorporated. Initially, ten MBHs with equal mass of\n$10^7M_\\odot$ are set in a host galaxy with $10^{11}M_\\odot$. It is found that\n4 - 6 MBHs merge successively within 1 Gyr, emitting gravitational wave\nradiation. The key process for the successive merger of MBHs is the dynamical\nfriction by field stars, which enhances three-body interactions of MBHs when\nthey enter the central regions of the galaxy. The heaviest MBH always composes\na close binary at the galactic center, which shrinks owing to the angular\nmomentum transfer by the third MBH and eventually merges. The angular momentum\ntransfer by the third MBH is due to the sling-shot mechanism.

The particularly simple\nform of the model allows for the study of the momentum transfer directly by\ninspection of the equations. The distribution of the high- and low-speed\nstreaks over the cross-section of the pipe produced by our model is remarkably\nsimilar to one observed in the velocity field near the trailing edge of the\npuff structures present in pipe flow transition. Under stochastic forcing, the\nmodel exhibits a quasi-periodic self-sustaining cycle characterized by the\ncreation and subsequent decay of \"streamwise-constant puffs\", so-called due to\nthe good agreement between the temporal evolution of their velocity field and\nthe projection of the velocity field associated with three-dimensional puffs in\na frame of reference moving at the bulk velocity. We establish that the flow\ndynamics are relatively insensitive to the regeneration mechanisms invoked to\nproduce near-wall streamwise vortices and that using small, unstructured\nbackground disturbances to regenerate the streamwise vortices is sufficient to\ncapture the formation of the high- and low-speed streaks and their segregation\nleading to the blunting of the velocity profile characteristic of turbulent\npipe flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 04:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

To this purpose, we adopt casting manipulation and\nvisual-based feedback control. Casting manipulation is a technique to deploy a\nrobotic end-effector far from the robot's base, by throwing the end-effector\nand controlling its ballistic flight using forces transmitted through a light\ntether connected to the end-effector itself. The tether cable can then be used\nto retrieve the end- effector to exert forces on the robot's environment. In\nprevious work, planar casting manipulation was demon- strated to aptly catch\nstatic objects placed at a distant, known position, thus proving it suitable\nfor applications such as sample acquisition and return, rescue, etc. In this\npaper we propose an extension of the idea to controlling the position of the\nend- effector to reach moving targets in 3D. The goal is achieved by an\ninnovative design of the casting mechanism, and by closing a real-time control\nloop on casting manipulation using visual feedback of moving targets. To\nachieve this result, simplified yet accurate models of the system suitable for\nreal-time computation are developed, along with a suitable visual feedback\nscheme for the flight phase. Effectiveness of the visual feedback controller is\ndemonstrated through experiments with a 2D casting robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 04:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-13"}

The composite scatterer forms a system of\ncoupled resonators and gives rise to multiple low frequency resonances. The\ncorresponding analytical model employs polar angle dependent boundary\nconditions on the surface of the N-slit cylinder. The solution inside the slits\nassumes plane waves. It is shown also that in the low-frequency range the\nN-slit rigid cylinder can be replaced by an equivalent fluid layer. Further\napproximations suggest a simple square root dependence of the resonant\nfrequencies on the number of slits and this is confirmed by data. The observed\nresonant phenomena are associated with Helmholtz-like behaviour of the\nresonator for which the radius and width of the openings are much smaller than\nthe wavelength. The problem of scattering by a finite periodic array of such\ncoupled resonators in air is solved using multiple scattering techniques. The\nresulting model predicts band-gap effects resulting from the resonances of the\nindividual composite scatterers below the first Bragg frequency .

Here\nwe take the truncated disc/hot inner flow picture which can describe the\nspectral changes, and show that propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations in\nthe hot flow can match the broad band power spectral properties seen in black\nhole binaries, i.e. give approximately band limited noise between a low and\nhigh frequency break. The low frequency break marks the viscous timescale at\nthe outer edge of the hot inner flow, which is the inner edge of the truncated\ndisc. The model also predicts the Lense-Thirring precession timescale of the\nhot flow, as this is set by the surface density of the flow which is self\nconsistently calculated from the propagating fluctuations. We show that this\nnaturally gives the observed relation between the low frequency break and QPO\nfrequency as the outer radius of the flow moves inwards, and that this model\npredicts many of the observed QPO properties such as correlation of coherence\nwith frequency, and of the recently discovered correlation of frequency with\nflux on short timescales. We fit this total model of the variability to a\nsequence of 5 observed power spectra from the bright black hole binary XTE\nJ1550-564 as the source transitioned from a low/hard to very high state. This\nis the first time that a power spectrum from a black hole binary has been fit\nwith a physical model for the variability.

For a TLS problem with data $A$, $b$, two formulas\nare derived that are simpler and more compact than the known results in the\nliterature. One is derived by exploiting the properties of Kronecker products\nof matrices. The other is obtained by making use of the singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) of $[A \\,\\,b]$, which allows us to compute the condition\nnumber cheaply and accurately. We present lower and upper bounds for the\ncondition number that involve the singular values of $[A \\,\\, b]$ and the last\nentries of the right singular vectors of $[A \\,\\, b]$.

It has been realized that the radiative\npressure feedback could be an efficient mechanism due to the existence of dust.\nIn this Letter, we discuss the effect of anisotropic radiative pressure, which\nis inevitable if the UV/optical emission arises from an accretion disk. The\ndistribution of dusty gas should be also anisotropic due to the influence of\nthe anisotropic disk radiation, i.e. the dust in the face-on direction of an\naccretion disk can be blown out relatively more easily, whereas the dust can\nsurvive in the edge-on direction. This result can explain the presence of some\nobscured AGNs with high Eddington ratios and can also quantitatively reproduce\nthe observed decreasing fraction of type 2 AGNs with increasing luminosity. A\nsequence of AGN formation and evolution is also proposed, within the context of\nthe formation, evolution and exhaustion of the dusty torus.

Possible associations with pulsars and active\ngalaxies have subsequently been discussed, and our observations provide an\nimportant contribution to this debate. In particular, an X-ray point source was\nfound within the 95% confidence error circle of 1FGL J1231.1-1410. X-ray\nspectrum is well-fitted by a blackbody with an additional power-law. This\nsupports the recently claimed identification of this source with a millisecond\npulsar (MSP) PSR J1231-1411.

We investigate the weighted frequency\ndistribution of the time evolution of the central spin inversion and give this\nphenomenon of collapses and revivals a reasonable explanation. We also discuss\nthe decoherence and the pointer states of the qubit from the perspectives of\nthe von Neumann entropy. It is found that the eigenstates of the qubit\nself-Hamiltonian emerge as the pointer states in the weak system-environment\ncoupling limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 15:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

As a result, cosmological magnetic\nfields with residual strengths of astrophysical relevance are generally sought\nby going outside standard cosmology, or by extending conventional\nelectromagnetic theory. Nevertheless, the survival of strong B-fields of\nprimordial origin is possible in spatially open Friedmann universes without\nchanging conventional electromagnetism. The reason is the hyperbolic geometry\nof these spacetimes, which slows down the adiabatic magnetic decay-rate and\nleads to their superadiabatic amplification on large scales. So far, the effect\nhas been found to operate on Friedmannian backgrounds containing either\nradiation or a slow-rolling scalar field. We show here that the superadiabatic\namplification of large-scale magnetic fields, generated by quantum fluctuations\nduring inflation, is essentially independent of the type of matter that fills\nthe universe and appears to be a generic feature of open Friedmann spacetimes.\nWe estimate the late-time strength of any residual field in a marginally open\nuniverse and show that it can easily meet the requirements for the dynamo\ngeneration of the magnetic fields observed in galaxies today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 15:44:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 12:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2011 14:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
