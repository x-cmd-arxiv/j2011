The H-alpha profile shape also varies on the photometric\ntimescales, and we describe the observed co-variations of the emission peak and\nabsorption trough properties. We argue that the episodes of photometric and\nemission brightening are caused by increases in the size of the emission region\nthat are related to variations in wind mass loss rate and outflow speed. We\nfind evidence of blueward accelerating, Discrete Absorption Components (DACs)\nin the absorption trough of the H-alpha profile, and these features have slower\naccelerations and longer durations than those observed in other lines. The DAC\nstrengths also appear to vary on the photometric timescales, and we suggest\nthat the propagation of the DAC-related wind structures is closely related to\nchanges in the overall wind mass loss rate and velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2011 20:23:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 03:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

One approach is to stratify patients into two or\nmore distinct risk groups with respect to a specific outcome using both\nclinical and demographic variables. Outcomes may be categorical or continuous\nin nature; important examples in cancer studies might include level of toxicity\nor time to recurrence. Recursive partitioning methods are ideal for building\nsuch risk groups. Two such methods are Classification and Regression Trees\n(CART) and a more recent competitor known as the partitioning\nDeletion/Substitution/Addition (partDSA) algorithm, both which also utilize\nloss functions (e.g. squared error for a continuous outcome) as the basis for\nbuilding, selecting and assessing predictors but differ in the manner by which\nregression trees are constructed.\n  Recently, we have shown that partDSA often outperforms CART in so-called\n\"full data\" (e.g., uncensored) settings. However, when confronted with censored\noutcome data, the loss functions used by both procedures must be modified.\nThere have been several attempts to adapt CART for right-censored data. This\narticle describes two such extensions for \\emph{partDSA} that make use of\nobserved data (i.e. possibly censored) loss functions. These observed data loss\nfunctions, constructed using inverse probability of censoring weights, are\nconsistent estimates of their uncensored counterparts provided that the\ncorresponding censoring model is correctly specified. The relative performance\nof these new methods is evaluated via simulation studies and illustrated\nthrough an analysis of clinical trial data on brain cancer patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2011 23:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 22:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The absorption\nconsists of 9 distinct troughs, and our analysis focuses on the troughs at ~\n-1000$ km s^{-1} for which we can measure accurate column densities of He I*,\nFe II and Mg II. We use photoionization models to constrain the ionization\nparameter, total hydrogen column density, and the number density of the\noutflowing gas. These constraints yield lower limits for the distance, mass\nflow rate and kinetic luminosity for the outflow of 3.7 kpc, 70 M_{sun}\nyr^{-1}, and 2.0 x 10^{43} ergs s^{-1}, respectively. Such mass flow rate value\ncan contribute significantly to the metal enrichment of the intra-cluster\nmedium. We find that this moderate velocity outflow is similar to those\nrecently discovered in massive post-starburst galaxies.
