Their execution time is however still an obstacle\nto the routine use of Monte Carlo packages in a clinical setting. To address\nthis problem, a completely new, and designed from the ground up for the GPU,\nMonte Carlo dose calculation package for voxelized geometries is proposed:\nGPUMCD. Method : GPUMCD implements a coupled photon-electron Monte Carlo\nsimulation for energies in the range 0.01 MeV to 20 MeV. An analogue simulation\nof photon interactions is used and a Class II condensed history method has been\nimplemented for the simulation of electrons. A new GPU random number generator,\nsome divergence reduction methods as well as other optimization strategies are\nalso described. GPUMCD was run on a NVIDIA GTX480 while single threaded\nimplementations of EGSnrc and DPM were run on an Intel Core i7 860. Results :\nDosimetric results obtained with GPUMCD were compared to EGSnrc. In all but one\ntest case, 98% or more of all significant voxels passed a gamma criteria of\n2%-2mm. In terms of execution speed and efficiency, GPUMCD is more than 900\ntimes faster than EGSnrc and more than 200 times faster than DPM, a Monte Carlo\npackage aiming fast executions. Absolute execution times of less than 0.3 s are\nfound for the simulation of 1M electrons and 4M photons in water for\nmonoenergetic beams of 15 MeV, including GPU-CPU memory transfers. Conclusion :\nGPUMCD, a new GPU-oriented Monte Carlo dose calculation platform, has been\ncompared to EGSnrc and DPM in terms of dosimetric results and execution speed.\nIts accuracy and speed make it an interesting solution for full Monte Carlo\ndose calculation in radiation oncology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 16:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Porous dust grains would lower the strength of ejecta lines relative to\nthose arising in the shocked ambient medium. In 0519-69.0, we find significant\nevidence for a higher than standard compression ratio of 12, implying efficient\ncosmic-ray acceleration by the blast wave.

While the social cost is the maximal load over all machines (makespan), the\ncost (disutility) of each player is the completion time of its own job. In the\ngame, players may follow selfish strategies to optimize their cost and\ntherefore their behaviors do not necessarily lead the game to an equilibrium.\nEven in the case there is an equilibrium, its makespan might be much larger\nthan the social optimum, and this inefficiency is measured by the price of\nanarchy -- the worst ratio between the makespan of an equilibrium and the\noptimum. Coordination mechanisms aim to reduce the price of anarchy by\ndesigning scheduling policies that specify how jobs assigned to a same machine\nare to be scheduled. Typically these policies define the schedule according to\nthe processing times as announced by the jobs. One could wonder if there are\npolicies that do not require this knowledge, and still provide a good price of\nanarchy.

In recent years, great progress has been made in cooling\nmicromechanical resonators towards their quantum mechanical ground state. This\nwork is an important step towards the creation of Schr\\\"odinger cats in the\nlaboratory, and the study of their destruction by decoherence. A direct test of\nthe gravity-induced state reduction scenario may therefore be within reach.\nHowever, a recent analysis shows that for all systems reported to date, quantum\nsuperpositions are destroyed by environmental decoherence long before\ngravitational state reduction takes effect. Here we report optical trapping of\nglass microspheres in vacuum with high oscillation frequencies, and cooling of\nthe center-of-mass motion from room temperature to a minimum temperature of 1.5\nmK. This new system eliminates the physical contact inherent to clamped\ncantilevers, and can allow ground-state cooling from room temperature. After\ncooling, the optical trap can be switched off, allowing a microsphere to\nundergo free-fall in vacuum. During free-fall, light scattering and other\nsources of environmental decoherence are absent, so this system is ideal for\nstudying gravitational state reduction. A cooled optically trapped object in\nvacuum can also be used to search for non-Newtonian gravity forces at small\nscales, measure the impact of a single air molecule, and even produce\nSchr\\\"odinger cats of living organisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 20:07:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 20:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}

In the literature, the reported error bars for Epeak are the simple\nPoisson statistical errors. Additional uncertainties arise due to the choices\nmade by analysts in determining Epeak (e.g., the start and stop times of\nintegration), imperfect knowledge of the response of the detector, different\nenergy ranges for various detectors, and differences in models used to fit the\nspectra. We examine the size of these individual sources of scatter by\ncomparing many independent pairs of published Epeak values for the same bursts.\nIndeed, the observed scatter in multiple reports of the same burst (often with\nthe same data) is greatly larger than the published statistical error bars. We\nmeasure that the one-sigma uncertainty associated with the analyst's choices is\n28%, i.e., 0.12 in Log10(Epeak), with the resultant errors always being\npresent. The errors associated with the detector response are negligibly small.\nThe variations caused by commonly-used alternative definitions of Epeak (such\nas present in all papers and in all compiled burst lists) is typically 23%-46%,\nalthough this varies substantially with the application. The implications of\nthis are: (1) Even the very best measured Epeak values will have systematic\nuncertainties of 28%. (2) Thus, GRBs have a limitation in accuracy for a single\nevent, with this being reducible by averaging many bursts. (3) The typical\none-sigma total uncertainty for collections of bursts is 55%. (4) We also find\nthat the width of the distribution for Epeak in the burst frame must be near\nzero, implying that some mechanism must exist to thermostat GRBs. (5) Our\ncommunity can only improve on this situation by using collections of bursts\nwhich all have identical definitions for the Epeak calculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 20:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We propose that NGC2419 is the remnant of a merged\nstar cluster complex, which was possibly formed during an interaction between a\ngas-rich galaxy and the Milky Way. To test this hypothesis, we performed\nnumerical simulations of 27 different models of star cluster complexes (CCs)\nmoving on a highly eccentric orbit in the Galactic halo. We vary the CC mass,\nthe CC size, and the initial distribution of star clusters in the CC to analyze\nthe influence of these parameters on the resulting objects. In all cases, the\nvast majority of star clusters merged into a stable object. The derived\nparameters mass, absolute V-band magnitude, effective radius, velocity\ndispersion and the surface brightness profile are, for a number of models, in\ngood agreement with those observed for NGC2419. Despite the large range of CC\nsizes, the effective radii of the merger objects are constrained to a\nrelatively small interval. A turnover in the r_eff vs. M_encl space leads to\ndegenerate states, i.e. relatively compact CCs can produce an object with the\nsame structural parameters as a more massive and larger CC. In consequence, a\nrange of initial conditions can form a merger object comparable to NGC2419\npreventing us to pinpoint the exact parameters of the original CC, which formed\nNGC2419. We conclude that NGC2419 can be well explained by the merged cluster\ncomplex scenario. Some of the recently discovered stellar streams in the\nGalactic halo might be related to the parent galaxy, which produced the cluster\ncomplex in our scenario.

We emphasize the importance of these\nresults by noting that 1) our results are the first analytical bounds on the\ncapacity of deletion-AWGN channels, 2) the results developed are the best\navailable analytical lower bounds on the deletion-substitution case, 3) for the\nGallager insertion channel model, the new lower bound improves the existing\nresults for small insertion probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 21:14:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 21:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 19:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 19:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Through numerical analysis,\nwe discuss the occurrence of mass synchronization in the model, where a source\npopulation which gets strongly synchronized drives the target populations onto\nmass synchronization. We hypothesize and identify a possible cause for the\noccurrence of such a synchronization, which is so far unknown: Pathological\nsynchronization is caused not just because of the increase in the strength of\ncoupling between the populations but also because of the strength of the strong\nsynchronization of the drive population.

Due to practical limitations, at any given time point,\nthe exact installation as well as the failure times are known for only those\nunits which have failed within that time frame after the installation. Hence,\nin-house reliability engineers are presented with a very limited, as well as\npartial, data to estimate different model parameters related to installation\nand failure distributions. In reality, other units in the batch are generally\nnot utilized due to lack of proper statistical methodology, leading to gross\nmisspecification.

The\npresent cavity design, based on a triangular cross section allows vertical\nconfinement and better signal collection efficiency than that of slab-based\nnanocavities, and eliminates the need for a pre-existing membrane. The nanobeam\nis fabricated by Focused-Ion-Beam (FIB) patterning. The cavity is characterized\nby a confocal photoluminescence.

A more advanced cavity\ndesign with Q=22,000 is modeled, showing the potential for high-Q\nimplementations using the triangular cavity design.

In the absence of a catalyst, pressures that are\nsignificantly higher than the equilibrium coexistence pressures are required to\ninduce the graphite-to-diamond transition. Furthermore, the formation of the\nmetastable hexagonal polymorph of diamond instead of the more stable cubic\ndiamond is favored at lower temperatures. The concerted mechanism suggested in\nprevious theoretical studies cannot explain these phenomena. Using an ab initio\nquality neural-network potential we performed a large-scale study of the\ngraphite-to-diamond transition assuming that it occurs via nucleation. The\nnucleation mechanism accounts for the observed phenomenology and reveals its\nmicroscopic origins. We demonstrated that the large lattice distortions that\naccompany the formation of the diamond nuclei inhibit the phase transition at\nlow pressure and direct it towards the hexagonal diamond phase at higher\npressure. The nucleation mechanism proposed in this work is an important step\ntowards a better understanding of structural transformations in a wide range of\ncomplex systems such as amorphous carbon and carbon nanomaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 11:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This object appears to be undergoing a major\nmerger. It is a double X-ray source and is detected in the radio at 1.4 GHz.\nThis paper investigates signatures of the interaction of the two components.\nRedshifts were measured to determine velocity dispersions and virial radii of\neach component. The technique of fuzzy clustering was used to assign membership\nweights to the galaxies in each clump. Using redshifts of 93 cluster members\nwithin 1.4 Mpc of the subcluster centres, the virial masses and anisotropy\nparameters are derived. 37% of the spectroscopically observed galaxies show\nemission lines and are predominantly star forming in the diagnostic diagram. No\nstrong AGN sources were found. The emission line galaxies tend to lie between\nthe two cluster centres with more near the SW clump. The luminosity functions\nof the two subclusters differ. The NE component is similar to many rich\nclusters, while the SW component has more faint galaxies. The NE clump's light\nprofile follows a single NFW profile with c = 10 while the SW is better fit\nwith an extended outer region and a compact inner core, consistent with\navailable X-ray data indicating that the SW clump has a cooling core. The\nobserved differences and properties of the two components of Abell 2465 are\ninterpreted to have been caused by a collision 2-4 Gyr ago, after which they\nhave moved apart and are now near their apocentres, although the start of a\nmerger remains a possibility.

Since cosmic ray nuclei do not radiate\nefficiently, their presence must be inferred indirectly. Previous theoretical\ncalculations and X-ray observations show that CR acceleration modifies\nsignificantly the structure of the SNR and greatly amplifies the interstellar\nmagnetic field. We present new, deep X-ray observations of the remnant of\nTycho's supernova (SN 1572, henceforth Tycho), which reveal a previously\nunknown, strikingly ordered pattern of non-thermal high-emissivity stripes in\nthe projected interior of the remnant, with spacing that corresponds to the\ngyroradii of 10^14 - 10^15 eV} protons. Spectroscopy of the stripes shows the\nplasma to be highly turbulent on the (smaller) scale of the Larmor radii of TeV\nenergy electrons. Models of the shock amplification of magnetic fields produce\nstructure on the scale of the gyroradius of the highest energy CRs present, but\nthey do not predict the highly-ordered pattern we observe.

However, the latter is restricted to\nelectrostatic interactions between charges and dipole moments. So with\nradiating dipole-dipole interaction where retardation effects are important for\nlarge separations of the particles, other methods are needed, and the resulting\ninduced interaction is the Casimir-Polder interaction usually obtained by field\ntheory. It can also be evaluated, however, by a statistical mechanical method\nthat utilizes the path integral representation.

We also show example results of the\ncoherent search on a stretch of data from LIGO's fourth science run but note\nthat a set of signal based vetoes will be needed before this search can be run\nto try to make detections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 15:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

The goals\nwere to identify additional sources suitable for use as phase calibrators for\ngalactic sources, determine their precise positions, and produce radio images.\nIn order to achieve these goals, we developed a new software package, PIMA, for\ndetermining group delays from wide-band data with much lower detection limit.\nWith the use of PIMA we have detected 327 sources out of 487 targets observed\nin three 24 hour VLBA experiments. Among the 327 detected objects, 176 are\nwithin 10 degrees of the Galactic plane. This VGaPS catalogue of source\npositions, plots of correlated flux density versus projected baseline length,\ncontour plots, as well as weighted CLEAN images and calibrated visibility data\nin FITS format, are available on the Web at http://astrogeo.org/vgaps.\nApproximately one half of objects from the 24 GHz catalogue were observed at\ndual band 8.6 GHz and 2.3 GHz experiments. Position differences at 24 GHz\nversus 8.6/2.3 GHz for all but two objects on average are strictly within\nreported uncertainties. We found that for two objects with complex structure\npositions at different frequencies correspond to different components of a\nsource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 15:59:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 11:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We extend the usual analysis of\nturbulent correlations containing pressure fluctuations in wall-bounded\n\\tsc{dns} computations [Kim J.: {\\em J.

An algorithm, based on a Green's function\napproach, is developed to compute the above splittings for various correlations\ncontaining pressure fluctuations (redistribution, pressure diffusion,\nvelocity/pressure-gradient), in fully developed turbulent plane channel flow.\nThis exact analysis confirms previous results based on a method-of-images\napproximation [Manceau R., Wang M., Laurence D.: {\\em J. Fluid Mech.} {\\bf 438}\n(2001) 307--338] showing that, at the wall, $p'_{(\\mathfrak{V})}$ and\n$p'_{(w)}$ are usually of the same sign and approximately equal. The above\nresults are then used to study the contribution of each mechanism on the\npressure correlations in low Reynolds-number plane channel flow, and to discuss\nstandard second-moment-closure modelling practices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 10:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 21:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
