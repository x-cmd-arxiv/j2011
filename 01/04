We investigate these claims here, by\ntesting three widely used scale-free and multiscale parameters, namely, the\nfractal dimension, the multifractal structure function and its inertial-range\nexponent, and the turbulent power spectrum and its power-law index, on a\ncomprehensive data set of 370 timeseries of active-region magnetograms (17,733\nmagnetograms in total) observed by SOHO's Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) over\nthe entire Solar Cycle 23. We find that both flaring and non-flaring active\nregions exhibit significant fractality, multifractality, and non-Kolmogorov\nturbulence but none of the three tested parameters manages to distinguish\nactive regions with major flares from flare-quiet ones. We also find that the\nmultiscale parameters, but not the scale-free fractal dimension, depend\nsensitively on the spatial resolution and perhaps the observational\ncharacteristics of the studied magnetograms. Extending previous works, we\nattribute the flare-forecasting inability of fractal and multifractal\nparameters to i) a widespread multiscale complexity caused by a possible\nunderlying self-organization in turbulent solar magnetic structures, flaring\nand non-flaring alike, and ii) a lack of correlation between the fractal\nproperties of the photosphere and overlying layers, where solar eruptions\noccur. However useful for understanding solar magnetism, therefore, scale-free\nand multiscale measures may not be optimal tools for active-region\ncharacterization in terms of eruptive ability or, ultimately,for major\nsolar-flare prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2011 16:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The RVs of both objects were measured with the\nTODCOR technique using synthetic template spectra as references. We also\nobtained V and I band photometry using the 1.0-m Elizabeth telescope at SAAO\nand the 0.4-m PROMPT instruments located at the CTIO. The orbital and physical\nparameters of the systems were derived with PHOEBE and JKTEBOP codes. We\ncompared our results with several sets of widely-used isochrones. Our\nmulti-epoch photometric observations demonstrate that both objects show\nsignificant out-of-eclipse modulations, which vary in time. We believe that\nthis effect is caused by stellar spots, which evolve on time scales of tens of\ndays. For this reason, we constructed our models on the basis of photometric\nobservations spanning short time scales (less than a month). Our modeling\nindicates that (1) ASAS-09 is a main sequence active system with nearly-twin\ncomponents with masses of M1 = 0.771(33) Msun, M2 = 0.768(21) Msun and radii of\nR1 = 0.772(12) Rsun and R2 = 0.769(13) Rsun.

A prominent component of the debris and of the IUM is the\nenormous number of old cold photons from decaying universes.

The sample of galaxies is drawn\nfrom four clusters, with <z>=0.04, and their surrounding structure extending to\n~10R_{vir}. We find that the distributions of the absorption-line strengths and\nthe stellar population parameters age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance\nratio do not differ significantly between the clusters and their outskirts, but\nthe tight correlations found between these quantities and velocity dispersion\nwithin the clusters are weaker in their outskirts. All three stellar population\nparameters of cluster galaxies are positively correlated with velocity\ndispersion. Galaxies in clusters form a homogeneous class of objects that have\nsimilar distributions of line-strengths and stellar population parameters, and\nfollow similar scaling relations regardless of cluster richness or morphology.\nWe estimate the intrinsic scatter of the Gaussian distribution of metallicities\nto be 0.3 dex, while that of the alpha-element abundance ratio is 0.07 dex. The\ne-folding time of the exponential distribution of galaxy ages is estimated to\nbe 900 Myr. The intrinsic scatters of the metallicity and alpha-element\nabundance ratio distributions can almost entirely be accounted for by the\ncorrelations with velocity dispersion and the intrinsic scatter about these\nrelations. This implies that a galaxies mass plays the major role in\ndetermining its stellar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2011 17:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The unavoidable\npredictions include supersymmetry (at some energy scale), SO(N) grand\nunification, a drastic diminishing of the usual cosmological constant, and a\nnonsupersymmetric dark matter WIMP which should be detectable within the next\nseveral years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2011 20:17:18 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 21:29:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 18:19:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 02:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 23:49:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 18:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2011 21:53:04 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 15:57:33 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2015 19:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 19:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

Due to\nthe rhombohedral symmetry of BiFeO3, there are four ferroelastic variances and\nthree different polarization switching events: (1) 71{\\deg} switching from r1-\nto r3+, (2) 109{\\deg} switching from r1- to r2+ (or r4+), and (3) 180o\nswitching from r1- to r1+ (the superscript + and - stand for up and down\npolarization, respectively).

The concentration power of an optical\nmodule, which determines primarily the telescope's sensitivity, is in general\nexpressed by its on-axis effective area as a function of the X-ray energy.\nNevertheless, the effective area of X-ray mirrors in general decreases as the\nsource moves off-axis, with a consequent loss of sensitivity. To make matters\nworse, the dense nesting of mirror shells in an optical module results in a\nmutual obstruction of their aperture when an astronomical source is off-axis,\nwith a further effective area reduction. [...] While the effective area of an\nX-ray mirror is easy to predict on-axis, the same task becomes more difficult\nfor a source off-axis. It is therefore important to develop an appropriate\nformalism to reliably compute the off-axis effective area of a Wolter-I mirror,\nincluding the effect of obstructions. Most of collecting area simulation for\nX-ray optical modules has been so far performed along with numerical codes,\ninvolving ray-tracing routines, very effective but in general complex,\ndifficult to handle, time consuming and affected by statistical errors. In\ncontrast, in a previous paper we approached this problem from an analytical\nviewpoint, to the end of simplifying and speeding up the prediction of the\noff-axis effective area of unobstructed X-ray mirrors with any reflective\ncoating, including multilayers.In this work we extend the analytical results\nobtained: we show that the analytical formula for the off-axis effective area\ncan be inverted, and we expose in detail a novel analytical treatment of mutual\nshell obstruction in densely nested mirror assemblies, which reduces the\noff-axis effective area computation to a simple integration. The results are in\nexcellent agreement with the findings of a detailed ray-tracing routine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2011 23:17:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 13:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 16:47:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 12:49:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 13:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

We propose and develop a series of\ntests for discriminating between a pure supersymmetry (SUSY) and a SUSY\nrealized within the well-motivated warped geometry a la Randall-Sundrum (RS).\nTwo of these tests make use of some different patterns arising in the\nsquark/slepton mass spectrum. The other distinctive RS SUSY feature is the\npossibly larger (even dominant) Higgs boson decay branching ratios into\nsleptons, compared to pure SUSY. Techniques for pinning up the presence of soft\nSUSY breaking terms on the TeV-brane are also suggested, based on the analysis\nof stop pair production at the International Linear Collider. For all these\nphenomenological studies, we had first to derive the 4-dimensional (4D)\neffective couplings and mass matrices of the sfermions and Higgs bosons in RS\nSUSY. The localization of Higgs bosons, characteristic of RS, leads to\nsingularities in their couplings which are regularized by the exchange\ncontribution of infinite towers of Kaluza-Klein (KK) scalar modes with\nDirichlet-Dirichlet boundary conditions. A general method is provided for this\nregularization, based on the completeness relation. The sfermion masses are\nobtained either from integrating out those specific KK towers or by treating\ntheir mixing effects. Finally, we show at the one-loop level how all quadratic\ndivergences in the Higgs mass cancel out for any cut-off, due to 5D SUSY and to\n5D anomaly cancellation; the analytical way followed here also allows a\njustification of the infinite KK summation required for the so-called KK\nregularization in 5D SUSY, which has motivated a rich literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 00:53:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2011 17:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-12"}

The magnetospheres of moving black holes resemble in many respects the\nmagnetospheres of rotationally-powered pulsars, with pair formation fronts and\nouter gaps, where the sign of the induced charge changes.

The issue is now particularly addressed in this paper through\nstudying the source locations of all the 1078 LASCO CMEs listed in CDAW CME\ncatalog during 1997 -- 1998 and their correlation with CMEs' apparent\nparameters. By manually checking LASCO and EIT movies of these CMEs, we find\nthat, except 231 CMEs whose source locations can not be identified due to poor\ndata, there are 288 CMEs with location identified on the front-side solar disk,\n234 CMEs appearing above solar limb, and 325 CMEs without evident eruptive\nsignatures in the field of view of EIT. Based on the statistical results of\nCMEs' source locations, four physical issues, including (1) the missing rate of\nCMEs by SOHO LASCO and EIT, (2) the mass of CMEs, (3) the causes of halo CMEs\nand (4) the deflections of CMEs in the corona, are exhaustively analyzed. It is\nfound that (1) about 32% of front-side CMEs can not be recognized by SOHO, (2)\nthe brightness of a CME at any heliocentric distance is roughly positively\ncorrelated with its speed, and the CME mass derived from the brightness is\nprobably overestimated, (3) both projection effect and violent eruption are the\nmajor causes of halo CMEs, and especially for limb halo CMEs, the latter is the\nprimary one, (4) most CMEs deflected towards equator near the solar minimum,\nand these deflections can be classified into three types, the asymmetrical\nexpansion, non-radial ejection, and the deflected propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 02:37:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 02:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-12"}

A structured representation of\nthe disease reporting events is extracted from the raw text, and the events are\nthen aggregated to produce signals, which are intended to represent early\nwarnings against potential public health threats.\n  To public health officials, these warnings represent an overwhelming list of\n\"one-size-fits-all\" information for risk assessment. To reduce this overload,\ntwo techniques are proposed. First, filtering signals according to the user's\npreferences (e.g., location, disease, symptoms, etc.) helps reduce the\nundesired noise. Second, re-ranking the filtered signals, according to an\nindividual's feedback and annotation, allows a user-specific, prioritized\nranking of the most relevant warnings.\n  We introduce an approach that takes into account this two-step process of: 1)\nfiltering and 2) re-ranking the results of reporting signals. For this,\nCollaborative Filtering and Personalization are common techniques used to\nsupport users in dealing with the large amount of information that they face.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 05:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-05"}

Upper limits were obtained for IRAS15250 and Arp299. We\nfind large H3O+ abundances (N(H3O+)/N(H2)>10^{-8}) in all detected galaxies\napart from in IC342 where it is about one order of magnitude lower. We note,\nhowever, that uncertainties in N(H3O+) may be significant due to lack of\ndefinite information on source size and excitation. We furthermore compare the\nderived N(H3O+) with N(HCO+) and find that the H3O+ to HCO+ column density\nratio is large in NGC1068 (24), moderate in NGC4418 and NGC253 (4-5), slightly\nless than unity in NGC6240 (0.7) and lowest in IC342 (0.2-0.6). We compare our\nresults with models of X-ray and photon dominated regions (XDRs and PDRs). For\nIC342 we find that a starburst PDR chemistry can explain the observed H3O+\nabundance. For the other galaxies, the large H3O+ columns are generally\nconsistent with XDR models. In particular for NGC1068 the elevated\nN(H3O+)/N(HCO+) ratio suggests a low column density XDR. For NGC4418 however,\nlarge HC3N abundances are inconsistent with the XDR interpretation. An\nalternative possibility is that H3O+ forms through H2O evaporating off dust\ngrains and reacting with HCO+ in warm, dense gas. This scenario could also\npotentially fit the results for NGC253. Further studies of the excitation and\ndistribution of H3O+ - as well as Herschel observations of water abundances -\nwill help to further constrain the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 09:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Using the most\nrecent thermal evolution models of Super Earths (Gaidos et al. 2010; Tachinami\net al. 2011) and updated scaling laws for convection-driven dynamos, we predict\nthe evolution of the local Rossby number.

In this work we go\nfurther, including the effects of rotation in the evolution of planetary\nmagnetic field regime and obtaining global constraints to the existence of\nintense protective magnetic fields in rapidly and slowly rotating Super Earths.\nWe find that the emergence and continued existence of a protective planetary\nmagnetic field is not only a function of planetary mass but also depend on\nrotation rate.

Often the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is dependent on some parameter and one is interested in\nfollowing the path of the resonances in the complex energy plane as the\nparameter changes. This is particularly true in coupled channel systems where\nthe resonant behavior is highly dependent on the strength of the channel\ncoupling, the energy separation of the channels and other factors. In previous\nwork it was shown that numerical continuation, a technique familiar in the\nstudy of dynamical systems, can be brought to bear on the problem of following\nthe resonance path in one dimensional problems and multi-channel problems\nwithout energy separation between the channels. A regularization can be defined\nthat eliminates coalescing poles and zeros that appear in the S-matrix at the\norigin due to symmetries. Following the zeros of this regularized function then\ntraces the resonance path. In this work we show that this approach can be\nextended to channels with energy separation, albeit limited to two channels.\nThe issue here is that the energy separation introduces branch cuts in the\ncomplex energy domain that need to be eliminated with a so-called\nuniformization.

This is the first result that\ndetermines the final number of edges of the more general H-free process for a\nnon-trivial \\emph{class} of graphs H. We also verify a conjecture of Osthus and\nTaraz concerning the average degree, and obtain a new lower bound on the\nindependence number. Our proof combines the differential equation method with a\ntool that might be of independent interest: we establish a rigorous way to\n`transfer' certain decreasing properties from the binomial random graph to the\nH-free process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 10:26:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 10:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

They predate the other components\nby 1-2 Myr, and likely condensed within a short time interval, close to the Sun\nin the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Their preservation must counterbalance both\nthe sunward drift caused by gas drag and the general inward motion of the\nentraining gas. We propose that an efficient outward transport of CAIs can be\nachieved by advection as a result of the viscous expansion of the disk,\nprovided it is initially less than 10 AU in size, which we argue is plausible\nfrom both observational and theoretical points of view. Gas drag would stop\nthis outward motion within $10^5$ yr. However, by that time, a magnetically\ndead zone would have developed as gravitational instabilities fade away, which\nwould trap CAIs for a significant fraction of the disk lifetime because of the\nreduced advection velocities. The dead zone would also prevent outward\ndiffusion of subsequently condensed CAIs, contributing to their observed narrow\nage range. This preservation mechanism is independent of the outward transport\nscenario (before the dead zone formation) and a natural consequence of\nconsidering the source of turbulence in accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 10:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Our goal is to characterize the earliest stages of star\nformation in this cloud. We used the bolometer array LABOCA at APEX to map the\ncloud in dust continuum emission at 870 micron. The detected sources are\nanalysed by carefully taking into account the spatial filtering inherent in the\ndata reduction process. A search for associations with YSOs is performed using\nSpitzer data and the SIMBAD database. Most of the detected 870 micron emission\nis distributed in 5 filaments. We identify 59 starless cores, one candidate\nfirst hydrostatic core, and 21 sources associated with more evolved YSOs. The\nstarless cores are only found above a visual extinction threshold of 5 mag.\nThey are less dense than those detected in other nearby molecular clouds by a\nfactor of a few on average. The core mass distribution is consistent with the\nIMF at the high-mass end but is overpopulated at the low-mass end. In addition,\nat most 17% of the cores have a mass larger than the critical Bonnor-Ebert\nmass. Both results suggest that a large fraction of the starless cores may not\nbe prestellar. Based on the census of prestellar cores, Class 0 protostars, and\nmore evolved YSOs, we conclude that the star formation rate has decreased with\ntime in this cloud. The low fraction of candidate prestellar cores among the\npopulation of starless cores, the small number of Class 0 protostars, the high\nglobal star formation efficiency, the decrease of the star formation rate with\ntime, and the low mass per unit length of the detected filaments all suggest\nthat we may be witnessing the end of the star formation process in Cha I\n{abridged}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 13:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-05"}

According to the\neffective-media model, the coupling interactions between the elements in\nmetamaterials are somewhat ignored; therefore, the effective properties of\nmetamaterials can be viewed as the \"averaged effect\" of the resonance property\nof the individual elements. However, the coupling interaction between elements\nshould always exist when they are arranged into metamaterials. Sometimes,\nespecially when the elements are very close, this coupling effect is not\nnegligible and will have a substantial effect on the metamaterials' properties.\nIn recent years, it has been shown that the interaction between resonance\nelements in metamaterials could lead to some novel phenomena and interesting\napplications that do not exist in conventional uncoupled metamaterials. In this\npaper, we will give a review of these recent developments in coupled\nmetamaterials. For the \"meta-molecule\" composed of several identical\nresonators, the coupling between these units produces multiple discrete\nresonance modes due to hybridization. In the case of a \"meta-crystal\"\ncomprising an infinite number of resonators, these multiple discrete resonances\ncan be extended to form a continuous frequency band by strong coupling. This\nkind of broadband and tunable coupled metamaterial may have interesting\napplications. Many novel metamaterials and nanophotonic devices could be\ndeveloped from coupled resonator systems in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 15:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In Paper I the\ncoupling between these motions was modelled by determining the horizontal\nmotion without reference to the vertical motion, and recovering the coupling by\nassuming that the vertical action is adiabatically conserved as the star\noscillates horizontally. Here we show that, although the assumption of\nadiabatic invariance works well, more accurate results can be obtained by\ntaking the vertical action into account when calculating the horizontal motion.\nWe use orbital tori to present a simple but fairly realistic model of the\nGalaxy's discs in which the motion of stars is handled rigorously, without\ndecomposing it into horizontal and vertical components. We examine the ability\nof the adiabatic approximation to calculate the model's observables, and find\nthat it performs perfectly in the plane, but errs slightly away from the plane.\nWhen the new correction to the adiabatic approximation is used, the density,\nstreaming velocity and velocity dispersions are in error by less than 10 per\ncent for distances up to $2.5\\kpc$ from the Sun. The torus-based model reveals\nthat at locations above the plane the long axis of the velocity ellipsoid\npoints almost to the Galactic centre, even though the model potential is\nsignificantly flattened. This result contradicts the widespread belief that the\nshape of the Galaxy's potential can be strongly constrained by the orientation\nof velocity ellipsoid near the Sun. An analysis of orbits reveals that in a\ngeneral potential the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid depends on the\nstructure of the model's distribution function as much as on its gravitational\npotential, contrary to what is the case for Staeckel potentials. We argue that\nthe adiabatic approximation will provide a valuable complement to torus-based\nmodels in the interpretation of current surveys of the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 15:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
