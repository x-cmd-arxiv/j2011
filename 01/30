Both single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links are\nconsidered.

Most of\ncurrent CS recovery algorithms are originally designed for one-dimensional (1D)\nsignal, while many practical signals are two-dimensional (2D). By utilizing 2D\nseparable sampling, 2D signal recovery problem can be converted into 1D signal\nrecovery problem so that ordinary 1D recovery algorithms, e.g. orthogonal\nmatching pursuit (OMP), can be applied directly. However, even with 2D\nseparable sampling, the memory usage and complexity at the decoder is still\nhigh. This paper develops a novel recovery algorithm called 2D-OMP, which is an\nextension of 1D-OMP. In the 2D-OMP, each atom in the dictionary is a matrix. At\neach iteration, the decoder projects the sample matrix onto 2D atoms to select\nthe best matched atom, and then renews the weights for all the already selected\natoms via the least squares.

Gravitational interaction coincides in the model with\ndipole interaction of a pair of charged bosons. The dipole consists of a\ncharged vector bosons pair from the major octonion algebra fields. When the\ncharged dipole pair interacts with the neutral bosons pair from the major\noctonion algebra fields, the charged bosons pair misses its mass.

The\nsolution is a product of interaction of major vector fields pair with charged\nW-bosons pair. It is inferred from the model that the state space is\nten-dimensional.

The optimal configurations exhibit a variety of helical\nstructures for the arrangement of macroions including zig-zag, solenoidal and\nbeads-on-a-string patterns. These structures are determined by a competition\nbetween attraction between spheres and the PE chain (which favors chain\nwrapping around the spheres), chain bending and electrostatic repulsion between\nchain segments (which favor unwrapping of the chain), and the interactions\nbetween neighboring sphere-chain complexes which can be attractive or repulsive\ndepending on the system parameters such as medium salt concentration, macroion\ncharge and chain length per macroion (linker size).

The aim of this work is to characterise the\nprevalence of spiral structure in this sample and, in the cases where a clear\nspiral pattern is found, include the findings in a comparative study (reported\nin paper II). A two-armed (`grand design') spiral pattern is found in\napproximately half the galaxies studied, including all those that are\ndesignated as grand design in the optical, but also including some, but not\nall, optically flocculent galaxies.

It is shown that in\nthe continuous limit this generating functional coincides with a model of an\ninextensible chain previously discussed by one of the authors of this work.\nNext, the approach developed here is applied to a inextensible chain, called\nthe freely jointed bar chain, in which the basic units are small extended\nobjects. The generating functional of the freely jointed bar chain is\nconstructed. It is shown that it differs profoundly from that of the freely\nhinged chain. Despite the differences, it is verified that in the continuous\nlimit both generating functionals coincide as it is expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2011 15:57:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 06:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
