In this paper, taking\nthese features into consideration, we propose a framework for the design and\nanalysis of a class of incentive schemes based on a social norm, which consists\nof a reputation scheme and a social strategy. We first define the concept of a\nsustainable social norm under which every agent has an incentive to follow the\nsocial strategy given the reputation scheme. We then formulate the problem of\ndesigning an optimal social norm, which selects a social norm that maximizes\noverall social welfare among all sustainable social norms. Using the proposed\nframework, we study the structure of optimal social norms and the impacts of\npunishment lengths and whitewashing on optimal social norms. Our results show\nthat optimal social norms are capable of sustaining cooperation, with the\namount of cooperation varying depending on the community characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2010 16:35:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2011 22:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-08"}

First, as each neighbor selects one message-bearing codeword from\nits unique codebook for transmission, it is shown that decoding their messages\nbased on a superposition of those codewords through the multiaccess channel is\nfundamentally a problem of compressed sensing. In the case where each message\nconsists of a small number of bits, an iterative algorithm based on belief\npropagation is developed for efficient decoding. Second, to satisfy the\nhalf-duplex constraint, each codeword consists of randomly distributed on-slots\nand off-slots. A node transmits during its on-slots, and listens to its\nneighbors only through its own off-slots. Over one frame interval, each node\nbroadcasts a message to neighbors and simultaneously decodes neighbors'\nmessages based on the superposed signals received through its own off-slots.\nThus the solution fully exploits the multiaccess nature of the wireless medium\nand addresses the half-duplex constraint at the fundamental level.

Given some of the strategic advantages for a\nbistatic configuration, and tech- nological advances in the past few years,\nlarge-scale implementation of the bistatic systems is a scope for the near\nfuture. If the bistatic systems are to replace the monostatic systems (at least\npar- tially), then all the existing usages of a monostatic system should be\nmanageable in a bistatic system. A detailed investigation of the possibilities\nof an automatic target recognition (ATR) facil- ity in a bistatic radar system\nis presented. Because of the lack of data, experiments were carried out on\nsimulated data. Still, the results are positive and make a positive case for\nthe introduction of the bistatic configuration. First, it was found that,\ncontrary to the popular expectation that the bistatic ATR performance might be\nsubstantially worse than the monostatic ATR performance, the bistatic ATR\nperformed fairly well (though not better than the monostatic ATR). Second, the\nATR per- formance does not deteriorate substantially with increasing bistatic\nangle. Last, the polarimetric data from bistatic scattering were found to have\ndistinct information, contrary to expert opinions. Along with these results,\nsuggestions were also made about how to stabilise the bistatic-ATR per-\nformance with changing bistatic angle. Finally, a new fast and robust ATR\nalgorithm (developed in the present work) has been presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2011 04:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}

Natural isolates of gametocytes are genetically diverse and\nbiologically complex. Infectiousness to mosquitoes relies on multiple\nparameters such as density, sex-ratio, maturity, parasite genotypes and host\nimmune factors. In this article, we investigated how density and genetic\ndiversity of gametocytes impact on the success of transmission in the mosquito\nvector. We analyzed data for which the number of covariates plus attendant\ninteractions is at least of order of the sample size, precluding usage of\nclassical models such as general linear models.
