The materials have good prospects\nfor biomedical applications, especially in the context of bone regeneration.\nEntropy-elastic gelatin based hydrogel films with varying crosslinking\ndensities were prepared with tailored mechanical properties. Gelatin was\ncovalently crosslinked in water above its sol gel transition, which suppressed\nthe gelatin chain helicity. Amorphous films were prepared with tailorable\ndegrees of swelling and wet state Young's modulus. The knowledge gained with\nthis bulk material was transferred to the integrated process of foaming and\ncrosslinking to obtain porous gelatin-based scaffolds. A gelatin solution was\nfoamed in the presence of saponin and the resulting foam was fixed by chemical\ncrosslinking with a diisocyanate. The scaffolds were analyzed in the dry state\nby micro computed tomography (\\mu CT, porosity: 65\\pm 11-73\\pm 14 vol.-%), and\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM, pore size: 117\\pm 28-166 \\pm 32 \\mu m).\nAfter equilibration with water, the scaffolds were form-stable and displayed\nshape recovery after removal of mechanical loads. The composition dependent\ncompression moduli (Ec: 10 50 kPa) were comparable to the bulk micromechanical\nYoung's moduli, which were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The\nhydrolytic degradation profile could be adjusted, and a controlled decrease of\nmechanical properties was observed. The scaffold cytotoxicity and immunologic\nresponses were analyzed in vitro. Indirect eluate tests were carried out with\nL929 cells so that fully cytocompatible scaffolds were obtained. Furthermore,\nthe material immune response was investigated in vitro. Minimal material\nendotoxin contamination was successfully achieved (<0.5 EU/mL) by using\nlow-endotoxin gelatin and performing all synthetic steps in cleanroom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2011 16:27:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 10:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-12"}

A token confers the right to engage in the\ncontrolled activity. Processors communicate with neighbors in the ring to\nobtain and release a token. The communication mechanism investigated in this\npaper is the safe register abstraction, which may arbitrarily corrupt a value\nthat a processor reads when the operation reading a register is concurrent with\nan write operation on that register by a neighboring processor. The main\nresults are simple protocols for quasi-atomic communication, constructed from\nsafe registers. A quasi-atomic register behaves atomically except that a\nspecial undefined value may be returned in the case of concurrent read and\nwrite operations. Under certain conditions that constrain the number of writes\nand registers, quasi-atomic protocols are adequate substitutes for atomic\nprotocols. The paper demonstrates how quasi-atomic protocols can be used to\nimplement a self-stabilizing token ring, either by using two safe registers\nbetween neighboring processors or by using O(lg N) safe registers between\nneighbors, which lowers read complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2011 22:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-11"}

In order to overcome this difficulty, here we propose a\nnewly devised method, molecular Monte Carlo simulation of systems connected to\nthree reservoirs: chemical potential, pressure, and temperature. Gibbs-Duhem\nequation thermodynamically limits the number of reservoirs to 2 for single\ncomponent systems. However, in conventional simulations utilizing 2 or fewer\nreservoirs, the system tends to be trapped in metastable states. Even if the\nsystem is allowed to escape from such metastable states in conventional\nsimulations, the fixed system size and/or the fixed number of particles result\nin creation of defects in ordered structures. This situation breaks global\nanisotropy of ordered structures and forces the periodicity of the structure to\nbe commensurate to the system size. Here we connect the such three reservoirs\nto overcome these difficulties. A method of adjusting the three reservoirs and\nobtaining thermodynamically stable states is also designed, based on\nGibbs-Duhem equation. Unlike the other conventional simulation techniques\nutilizing no more than 2 reservoirs, our method allows the system itself to\nsimultaneously tune the system size and the number of particles to periodicity\nand anisotropy of ordered structures. Our method requires fewer efforts for\npreliminary simulations prior to production runs, compared with the other\nadvanced simulation techniques such as multicanonical method. A free energy\nmeasurement method, suitable for the system with the three reservoirs, is also\ndiscussed, based on Euler equation of thermodynamics. This measurement method\nneeds fewer computational efforts than other free energy measurement methods\ndo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 01:21:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 02:58:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 02:32:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 12:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-21"}

Guided by idealized but soluble\n{\\it non}renormalizable models, a nontraditional proposal for the quantization\nof covariant scalar field theories is advanced, which achieves a term-by-term,\ndivergence-free, perturbation analysis of interacting models expanded about a\nsuitable pseudofree theory, which differs from a free theory by an O(\\hbar^2)\ncounterterm. These positive features are realized within a functional integral\nformulation by a local, nonclassical, counterterm that effectively transforms\nparameter changes in the action from generating mutually singular measures,\nwhich are the basis for divergences, to equivalent measures, thereby removing\nall divergences. The use of an alternative model about which to perturb is\nalready supported by properties of the classical theory, and is allowed by the\ninherent ambiguity in the quantization process itself.

We model the structure of the\nnetwork by assuming that products require a large number of non-tradable\ninputs, or capabilities, and that countries differ in the completeness of the\nset of capabilities they have. We solve the model assuming that the probability\nthat a country has a capability and that a product requires a capability are\nconstant and calibrate it to the data to find that it accounts well for all of\nthe network features except for the heterogeneity in the distribution of\ncountry diversification. In the light of the model, this is evidence of a large\nheterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities across countries. Finally, we\nshow that the model implies that the increase in diversification that is\nexpected from the accumulation of a small number of capabilities is small for\ncountries that have a few of them and large for those with many. This implies\nthat the forces that help drive divergence in product diversity increase with\nthe complexity of the global economy when capabilities travel poorly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 05:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 22:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-02"}

Because the solar wind speed is high, we follow the\napproach first pioneered by Matthaeus et al. (1982, Phys. Rev.

That is a well-satisfied\nassumption for the data used in this study. The magnetic helicity derives from\nthe skew-symmetric terms of the three-dimensional magnetic correlation tensor,\nwhile the symmetric terms of the tensor are used to determine the magnetic\nenergy spectrum. Our results show a sign change of magnetic helicity at\nwavenumber k~2 AU^{-1} (or frequency nu~2 uHz) at distances below 2.8 AU and at\nk~30 AU^{-1} (or nu~25 uHz) at larger distances. At small scales the magnetic\nhelicity is positive at northern heliographic latitudes and negative at\nsouthern latitudes. The positive magnetic helicity at small scales is argued to\nbe the result of turbulent diffusion reversing the sign relative to what is\nseen at small scales at the solar surface. Furthermore, the magnetic helicity\ndeclines toward solar minimum in 1996.

Because the specific angular momentum in a Keplerian disk\nincreases with the square root of the radius, the decretion mass loss\nassociated with a required level of angular momentum loss depends crucially on\nthe outer radius for viscous coupling of the disk, and can be significantly\nless than the spherical mass loss the spherical, wind-like mass loss commonly\nassumed in evolutionary calculations.

Transitions from one class to another could take place in\na matter of hours. In some of the classes, the spectral state transitions\n(burst-off to burst-on and vice versa) were found to take place in a matter of\nfew to few tens of seconds. In the literature, there is no attempt to\nunderstand in which order these classes were exhibited. Since the observation\nwas not continuous, the appearances of these classes seem to be in random\norder. Our goal is to find a natural sequence of these classes and compare with\nthe existing observations.

In the present paper, we compute the ratios of the power-law photons\nand the black body photons in the spectrum of each class and call these ratios\nas the `Comptonizing efficiency'(CE). We sequence the classes from the low to\nthe high value of CE. We clearly find that each variability class could be\ncharacterized by a unique average Comptonizing efficiency. The sequence of the\nclasses based on this parameter seem to be corroborated by a handful of the\nobserved transitions caught by Rossi X-ray timing explorer and the Indian\npayload Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment and we believe that future\nobservation of the object would show that the transitions can only take place\nbetween consecutive classes in this sequence. Since the power-law photons are\nproduced by inverse Comptonization of the intercepted soft-photons from the\nKeplerian disk, a change in CE actually corresponds to a change in geometry of\nthe compton cloud. Thus we claim that the size of the Compton cloud gradually\nrises from very soft class to the very hard class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 09:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2011 08:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-06"}

A high silicate absorption strength is also found in\nseveral of the HC3N-luminous objects, which may help the HC3N to survive.\nFinally, we find that a high HC3N/HCN ratio is related to a high dust\ntemperature and a low C II flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 09:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In\nparticular, the reduced spectral functions depending respectively on the first\nand second SU(n) factor of the double engender two toric moment maps on the\nIII(b) phase space CP(n-1) that play the roles of action-variables and\nparticle-positions. A suitable central extension of the SL(2,Z) mapping class\ngroup of the torus with one boundary component is shown to act on the\nquasi-Hamiltonian double by automorphisms and, upon reduction, the standard\ngenerator S of the mapping class group is proved to descend to the Ruijsenaars\nself-duality symplectomorphism that exchanges the toric moment maps.

The high quality Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum shows weak 9.7 um absorption from amorphous silicates. This confirms\nfor the first time the O-rich nature of IRAS 17423-1755 in contradiction to a\nprevious C-rich classification, which was based on the wrong identification of\nthe strong 3.1 um absorption feature seen in the Infrared Space Observatory\n(ISO) spectrum as due to acetylene (C2H2).

Thus, the strong 3.1\num absorption band toward IRAS 17423-1755 has to be identified as water ice. In\naddition, a [Ne II] nebular emission line at 12.8 um is clearly detected,\nindicating that the ionization of its central region may be already started.\nThe spectral energy distribution in the infrared (2-200 um) and other\nobservational properties of IRAS 17423-1755 are discussed in comparison with\nthe similar post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) objects IRAS 19343+2926 and IRAS\n17393-2727.

Ongoing large surveys, made possible by new\ninstrumentation at wavelengths from the ultraviolet (GALEX), via optical (HST\nand large groundbased telescopes) and infrared (Spitzer) to the radio are\nproviding much new information about disk galaxies over a wide range of\nredshift. Although progress has been made, the dynamics and structure of\nstellar disks, including their truncations, are still not well understood. We\ndo now have plausible estimates of disk mass-to-light ratios, and estimates of\nToomre's $Q$ parameter show that they are just locally stable. Disks are mostly\nvery flat and sometimes very thin, and have a range in surface brightness from\ncanonical disks with a central surface brightness of about 21.5 $B$-mag\narcsec$^{-2}$ down to very low surface brightnesses. It appears that galaxy\ndisks are not maximal, except possibly in the largest systems. Their HI layers\ndisplay warps whenever HI can be detected beyond the stellar disk, with\nlow-level star formation going on out to large radii. Stellar disks display\nabundance gradients which flatten at larger radii and sometimes even reverse.\nThe existence of a well-defined baryonic Tully-Fisher relation hints at an\napproximately uniform baryonic to dark matter ratio. Thick disks are common in\ndisk galaxies and their existence appears unrelated to the presence of a bulge\ncomponent; they are old, but their formation is not yet understood. Disk\nformation was already advanced at redshifts of $\\sim 2$, but at that epoch\ndisks were not yet quiescent and in full rotational equilibrium. Downsizing is\nnow well-established.

Use of the density matrix was emphasized in\nQDENSITY, although that code was also applicable to a quantum state\ndescription. In the present version, the quantum state version is stressed and\nmade amenable to future extensions to parallel computer simulations. The add-on\nQCWAVE extends QDENSITY in several ways. The first way is to describe the\naction of one, two and three- qubit quantum gates as a set of small ($2 \\times\n2, 4\\times 4$ or $8\\times 8$) matrices acting on the $2^{n_q}$ amplitudes for a\nsystem of $n_q$ qubits. This procedure was described in our parallel computer\nsimulation QCMPI and is reviewed here. The advantage is that smaller storage\ndemands are made, without loss of speed, and that the procedure can take\nadvantage of message passing interface (MPI) techniques, which will hopefully\nbe generally available in future Mathematica versions.\n  Another extension of QDENSITY provided here is a multiverse approach, as\ndescribed in our QCMPI paper. This multiverse approach involves using the\npresent slave-master parallel processing capabilities of Mathematica 7.0/8.0 to\nsimulate errors and error correction. The basic idea is that parallel versions\nof QCWAVE run simultaneously with random errors introduced on some of the\nprocessors, with an ensemble average used to represent the real world\nsituation. Within this approach, error correction steps can be simulated and\ntheir efficacy tested. This capability allows one to examine the detrimental\neffects of errors and the benefits of error correction on particular quantum\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 11:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This paper aims to study such integral\ntransforms from general principles, using 4 different yet equivalent\ndefinitions of the classical Fourier transform. This is applied to the\nso-called Clifford-Fourier transform (see [F. Brackx et al., The\nClifford-Fourier transform. J. Fourier Anal. Appl. 11 (2005), 669--681]). The\nintegral kernel of this transform is a particular solution of a system of PDEs\nin a Clifford algebra, but is, contrary to the classical Fourier transform, not\nthe unique solution. Here we determine an entire class of solutions of this\nsystem of PDEs, under certain constraints. For each solution, series\nexpressions in terms of Gegenbauer polynomials and Bessel functions are\nobtained. This allows to compute explicitly the eigenvalues of the associated\nintegral transforms. In the even-dimensional case, this also yields the inverse\ntransform for each of the solutions. Finally, several properties of the entire\nclass of solutions are proven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 12:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-11"}

These data reveal the form of\nthe power spectrum over frequencies from 10^-4 Hz, below the previously\ndetected power spectral break, to > 10^-2 Hz, above the frequency of the\ninnermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole (nu_ISCO ~ 10^-3 -\n10^-2 Hz, depending on the black hole spin parameter j). This is equivalent to\nprobing frequencies >1 kHz in a stellar mass (M_BH ~ 10 Msun) black hole binary\nsystem. The power spectrum is a featureless power law over the region of the\nexpected ISCO frequency, suggesting no strong enhancement or change in the\nvariability at the fastest orbital period in the system. Despite the huge\namplitude of the flux variations between the observations (peak-to-peak factor\nof >50) the power spectrum appears to be stationary in shape, and varies in\namplitude at all observed frequencies following the previously established\nlinear rms-flux relation. The rms-flux relation is offset in flux by a small\nand energy-dependent amount. The simplest interpretation of the offset is in\nterms of a very soft spectral component that is practically constant (compared\nto the primary source of variability). One possible origin for this emission is\na circumnuclear shock energised by a radiatively driven outflow from the\ncentral regions, and emitting via inverse-Compton scattering of the central\nengine's optical-UV continuum (as inferred from a separate analysis of the\nenergy spectrum). A comparison with the power spectrum of a long XMM-Newton\nobservation taken in 2001 gives only weak evidence for non-stationarity in\npower spectral shape or amplitude.

The proof employs Hardy-type inequalities due to Laptev and Weidl\nfor the two-dimensional magnetic Schroedinger operator and the method of\nself-similar variables and weighted Sobolev spaces for the heat equation. A\ncareful analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the heat equation in the\nsimilarity variables shows that the magnetic field asymptotically degenerates\nto an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field with the same total magnetic flux, which\nleads asymptotically to the gain on the polynomial decay rate in the original\nphysical variables.

There is growing evidence\nthat planets might form in circumprimary disks of medium-separation binaries.\nThe tidal forces caused by the secondary generally act to distort the\noriginally circular disk to an eccentric one. To infer the disk eccentricity\nfrom high-res NIR spectroscopy, we calculate the fundamental band emission\nlines of the CO molecule emerging from the atmosphere of the disk. We model\ncircumprimary disk evolution under the gravitational perturbation of the\norbiting secondary using a 2D grid-based hydrodynamical code, assuming\nalpha-type viscosity. The hydrodynamical results are combined with our spectral\ncode based on the double-layer disk model to calculate the CO molecular line\nprofiles. We find that the orbital velocity distribution of the gas parcels\ndiffers significantly from the circular Keplerian fashion, thus the line\nprofiles are asymmetric in shape. The magnitude of asymmetry is insensitive to\nthe binary mass ratio, the magnitude of viscosity, and the disk mass. In\ncontrast, the disk eccentricity, thus the level of the line profile asymmetry,\nis influenced significantly by the binary eccentricity and the disk geometrical\nthickness. We demonstrate that the disk eccentricity profile in the\nplanet-forming region can be determined by fitting the high-resolution CO line\nprofile asymmetry using a simple 2D spectral model that accounts for the\nvelocity distortions caused by the disk eccentricity. Thus, with our novel\napproach the disk eccentricity can be inferred with high-resolution near-IR\nspectroscopy prior to the era of high angular resolution optical or radio\ndirect-imaging. By determining the disk eccentricity in medium-separation young\nbinaries, we might be able to constrain the planet formation theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 14:08:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 15:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

These simple analytical solutions immediately allow us\nto construct evolutionary tracks and isochrones in terms of cluster half-mass\ndensity, cluster mass and galacto-centric radius. From a comparison to the\nMilky Way globular clusters we find that roughly 1/3 of them are in the second,\nevaporation-dominated phase and for these clusters the density inside the\nhalf-mass radius varies with the galactocentric distance R as rho_h ~ 1/R^2.\nThe remaining 2/3 are still in the first, expansion-dominated phase and their\nisochrones follow the environment-independent scaling rho_h ~ M^2; that is, a\nconstant relaxation time-scale.

Cyclic field\nvariations, characteristic for the solar magnetic field, are often explained by\nan important omega-effect, i.e. by the stretching of field lines due to strong\ndifferential rotation. Aims: The dynamo mechanism of a convective, oscillatory\ndynamo model is investigated. Methods: We solve the MHD-equations for a\nconducting Boussinesq fluid in a rotating spherical shell. For a resulting\noscillatory model, dynamo coefficients have been computed with the help of the\nso-called test-field method. Subsequently, these coefficients have been used in\na mean-field calculation in order to explore the underlying dynamo mechanism.\nResults: Although the rather strong differential rotation present in this model\ninfluences the magnetic field, the omega-effect alone is not responsible for\nits cyclic time variation. If the omega-effect is suppressed, the resulting\nalpha^2-dynamo remains oscillatory. Surprisingly, the corresponding alpha-omega\ndynamo leads to a non-oscillatory magnetic field. Conclusions: The assumption\nof an alpha-omega mechanism does not explain the occurrence of magnetic cycles\nsatisfactorily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 15:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

QCD results from collider experiments -- mostly\nfrom the LHC but also from the Tevatron, RHIC and HERA -- were discussed and\ncompared to various hadronic Monte Carlo generators, aiming at an improvement\nof our theoretical understanding of soft, semi-hard and hard parton dynamics.\nThe latest cosmic-ray results from various ground-based observatories were also\npresented with an emphasis on the phenomenological modeling of the first\nhadronic interactions of the extended air-showers generated in the Earth\natmosphere.

The extinction distribution in\nthe optical shows complex structure, with maxima correlating in position with\nthose of the emission at 24 mi and 8 mi. The Ha luminosity absorbed by the dust\nwithin the GHIIR reproduces the structure observed in the 24 mi image,\nsupporting the use of this band as a tracer of recent star formation. A\nvelocity difference of ~50 km/s was measured between the areas of high and low\nsurface brightness, which would be expected if NGC588 were an evolved GHIIR.\nLine ratios used in the BPT diagnostic diagrams show a larger range of\nvariation in the low surface brightness areas. The ranges are ~0.5 to 1.2 dex\nfor [NII]/Ha, 0.7 to 1.7 dex for [SII]/Ha, and 0.3 to 0.5 dex for [OIII]/Hb.\nRatios corresponding to large ionization parameter (U) are found between the\npeak of the emission in Hb and the main ionizing source decreasing radially\noutwards within the region. Differences between the integrated and local values\nof the U tracers can be as high as ~0.8 dex. [OII]/Hb and [OIII]/[OII] yield\nsimilar local values for U and consistent with those expected from the\nintegrated spectrum of an HII region ionized by a single star. The ratio\n[SII]/Ha departs significantly from the range predicted by this scenario,\nindicating the complex ionization structure in GHIIRs. There is a significant\nscatter in derivations of Z using strong line tracers as a function of\nposition, caused by variations in the degree of ionization. The scatter is\nsmaller for N2O3 which points to this tracer as a better Z tracer than N2. The\ncomparison between integrated and local line ratio values indicates that\nmeasurements of the line ratios of GHIIR in galaxies at distances >~25 Mpc may\nbe dominated by the ionization conditions in their low surface brightness\nareas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 15:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In our\nstudy, we consider a regenerative opportunistic relaying scheme in which the\ndirect path can be considered unusable, and takes into account the effect of\nthe possible erroneously detected and transmitted data at the best relay. We\nfirst derive statistics based on exact probability density function (PDF) of\neach hop. Then, the PDFs are used to determine accurate closed form expressions\nfor end-to-end bit-error rate (BER) of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)\nmodulation.

Finally, we validate our analysis by showing\nthat performance simulation results coincide with our analytical results over\ndifferent network architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 06:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-28"}
