We apply our formalism to a\nrenormalised interacting quantum field theoretical model. Using\nout-of-equilibrium field theory techniques we show that the Gaussian von\nNeumann entropy for a pure quantum state increases to the interacting thermal\nentropy. This quantifies decoherence and thus measures how classical our pure\nstate has become. The decoherence rate is equal to the single particle decay\nrate in our model. We also compare our approach to existing approaches to\ndecoherence in a simple quantum mechanical model. We show that the entropy\nfollowing from the perturbative master equation suffers from physically\nunacceptable secular growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 16:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 12:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This source was in a quiescent state\nfrom the start of science operations of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in\n2008 August until 2009 September, and then became more active, with gradually\nincreasing flux and some moderately-bright flares. In 2010 April and June, 4C\n+21.35 underwent a very strong GeV outburst composed of several major flares\ncharacterized by rise and decay timescales of the order of a day. During the\noutburst, the GeV spectra of 4C +21.35 displayed a broken power-law form with\nspectral breaks observed near 1-3 GeV photon energies. We demonstrate that, at\nleast during the major flares, the jet in 4C +21.35 carried a total kinetic\nluminosity comparable to the total accretion power available to feed the\noutflow.

Our selection criteria, which is based on\nhighly compact, relativistically beamed jet emission and large extended radio\nflux, thus provides an effective method of discovering new X-ray jets\nassociated with AGN. The detected X-ray jet morphologies are generally well\ncorrelated with the radio emission, except for those displaying sharp bends in\nthe radio band. The X-ray emission mechanism for these powerful FR II\n(Fanaroff-Riley type II) jets can be interpreted as inverse Compton scattering\noff of cosmic microwave background (IC/CMB) photons by the electrons in the\nrelativistic jets. We derive viewing angles for the jets, assuming a\nnon-bending, non-decelerating model, by using superluminal parsec scale speeds\nalong with parameters derived from the inverse Compton X-ray model. We use\nthese angles to calculate best fit Doppler and bulk Lorentz factors for the\njets, as well as their possible ranges, which leads to extreme values for the\nbulk Lorentz factor in some cases. When both the non-bending and\nnon-decelerating assumptions are relaxed [abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 17:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Standard binary evolution theory suggests that PSR J1713+0747\nevolved from a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Here, we test this hypothesis. We\nused a binary evolution code and a WD evolution code to calculate evolutionary\nsequences of LMXBs that could result in binary millisecond radio pulsars such\nas PSR J1713+0747. During the mass exchange, the mass transfer is\nnonconservative.

The high accretion rates at high-z drive more rapid star formation,\nwhile also making disks thicker and clumpier; the clumps are expected to be\nshort-lived in the presence of strong galactic outflows as observed. Hence\nequivalently rapid star-formers at high redshift are not analogous to local\nmerger-driven starbursts, but rather to local disks with highly enhanced\naccretion rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 21:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This crossover presents a\nunique feature characterizing the surface states of a topological insulator\nwith the gap opened at the Dirac point in the quantum diffusion regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2011 03:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 11:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 14:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Such particles can excite Alfven Eigenmodes (AEs), which\nsignificantly degrade their confinement and threatens the vacuum vessel of\nfuture reactors. To develop diagnostics and control schemes, a better\nunderstanding of linear and nonlinear features of resonant interactions between\nplasma waves and high-energy particles, is required. In the case of an isolated\nsingle resonance, the problem is homothetic to the so-called Berk-Breizman (BB)\nproblem, which is an extension of the classic bump-on-tail electrostatic\nproblem, including external damping to a thermal plasma, and collisions. A\nsemi-Lagrangian simulation code, COBBLES, is developed to solve the\ninitial-value BB problem. The nonlinear behavior of instabilities in\nexperimentally-relevant conditions is categorized into steady-state, periodic,\nchaotic, and frequency-sweeping (chirping) regimes. The chaotic regime is shown\nto extend into a linearly stable region, and a mechanism for such subcritical\ninstabilities is proposed. Analytic and semi-empirical laws for nonlinear\nchirping characteristics, such as sweeping-rate, lifetime, and asymmetry, are\ndeveloped and validated. Long-time simulations demonstrate the existence of a\nquasi-periodic chirping regime. Collisional drag and diffusion are shown to be\nessential to reproduce the alternation between major chirping events and\nquiescent phases, which is observed in experiments. Based on these findings, a\nfitting procedure between COBBLES simulations and chirping AE experiments is\ndevelopped. This procedure, which yields local linear drive and external\ndamping rate, is applied to Toroidicity-induced AEs (TAEs) on JT-60U and MAST\ntokamaks. This suggests the existence of TAEs relatively far from marginal\nstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2011 04:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

We design a random\nwalk on an appropriately defined weighted graph that achieves high efficiency\nby preferentially crawling those nodes and edges that convey greater\ninformation regarding the target metric. Our approach begins by employing the\ntheory of stratification to find optimal node weights, for a given estimation\nproblem, under an independence sampler. While optimal under independence\nsampling, these weights may be impractical under graph crawling due to\nconstraints arising from the structure of the graph. Therefore, the edge\nweights for our random walk should be chosen so as to lead to an equilibrium\ndistribution that strikes a balance between approximating the optimal weights\nunder an independence sampler and achieving fast convergence. We propose a\nheuristic approach (stratified weighted random walk, or S-WRW) that achieves\nthis goal, while using only limited information about the graph structure and\nthe node properties. We evaluate our technique in simulation, and\nexperimentally, by collecting a sample of Facebook college users.

The value of $E_g$ may be adjusted by varying the frequency and\nintensity of the light and could be much larger compared to that which is\ngenerated by spin-orbit coupling, and may reach values of the gap reported for\nepitaxially grown graphene.

Introduction: ADHD is one of\nthe most widely spread condition of school aged children affecting 5% of\nchildren of this age.The core clinical signs of ADHD are inattention,\nrestlessness and impulsivity. According to various authors direct measures of\nattention are of two types: 1. Recording the alpha rhythm on the EEG and\nevent-related potentials (ERP); 2. Tests of reaction time, continuous\nperformance tests, paired associated learning, and tests of memorization; The\nsecond one is evidence-based. As for the first one it is known that ERPs\nespecially of those with later response reflect the process of mental\neffortfullness to select the appropriate behavior and accomplish decision\nmaking during the action of target stimulus. Thus selection of action as well\nas decision making is the most important points affected in ADHD children.\nBesides in recent years EEG biofeedback (Neurofeedback) have become the\nevidence-based in the treatment of ADHD. Unfortunately the effectiveness of\nthis approach on ERPs parameters is still unknown. Thus we aimed to study the\nchanges of ERPs after neurofeedback therapy.

Because of the potential importance of understanding the origin of\nthe ICL in the context of the formation and evolution of structure in the\nUniverse, the field has recently undergone a revival both in the quality and\nquantity of observational and theoretical investigations. Due to cosmological\ndimming, the observational work has mostly concentrated on low redshift\nclusters, but clearly observations at higher redshifts can provide interesting\nclues about the evolution of the diffuse component. In this paper we present\nthe first results of a program to characterize the ICL of intermediate redshift\nclusters. We find that at z ~ 0.3, the X-ray cluster RX J0054.0-2823 already\nhas a significant ICL and that the fraction of the total light in the ICL and\nthe brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is comparable to that of similar clusters at\nlower redshift. We also find that the kinematics of the ICL is consistent with\nit being the remnant of tidally destroyed galaxies streaming in the central\nregions of the cluster, which has three central giant elliptical galaxies\nacting as an efficient \"grinding machine\". Our cluster has a bi-modal\nradial-velocity distribution and thus two possible values for the velocity\ndispersion.

We formulate a hydration model where the hydrogen bonds\nbetween water molecules pertaining to the first shell of the protein\nconformation may be either mainly formed or broken. At thermal equilibrium,\nhydrogen bonds are formed at low temperature and are broken at high\ntemperature. To explore the solvent effect, we follow the folding of a large\nsampling of protein chains, using a master-equation evolution. The dynamics\nshows a clear mechanism. Above the glass-transition temperature, a large ratio\nof chains fold very rapidly into the native structure irrespective of the\ntemperature, following pathways of high transition rates through structures\nsurrounded by the solvent with broken hydrogen bonds. Although these states\nhave an infinitesimal probability, they act as strong dynamical attractors and\nfast folding proceeds along these routes rather than pathways with small\ntransition rates between configurations of much higher equilibrium\nprobabilities. At a given low temperature, a broad jump in the folding times is\nobserved. Below this glass temperature, the pathways where hydrogen bonds are\nmainly formed become those of highest rates although with conformational\nchanges of huge relaxation times.

Several different approaches exist to solve such class of problems,\ne.g., Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) based\non Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm (SSS). Such techniques are complete from a\ncomputation-theoretic perspective: given a set of private inputs, it is\npossible to perform arbitrary computation tasks without revealing any of the\nintermediate results. In fact, HE and SSS can operate also on secret inputs\nand/or provide secret outputs.

We find that HII region expansion reduces the disordered\ncomponent of the B field, imposing a large-scale order on the field around its\nborder. The field in the neutral gas lies along the ionisation front, while the\nfield in the ionised gas tends to be perpendicular to this. The highest\npressure compressed neutral/molecular gas is driven towards approximate\nequipartition between thermal/magnetic/turbulent energy densities, whereas\nlower pressure neutral/molecular gas divides into quiescent, magnetically\ndominated regions, and, on the other hand, turbulent, demagnetised regions. The\nionised gas shows approximate thermal/turbulent equipartition, but with\nmagnetic energy densities 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower. A high velocity\ndispersion (approx 8 km/s) is maintained in the ionised gas throughout our\nsimulations, despite the mean expansion velocity being significantly lower. The\nB field does not significantly brake the HII region expansion on the length and\ntimescales accessible to our simulations, but it does tend to suppress the\nsmall-scale fragmentation and radiation-driven implosion of neutral/molecular\ngas that forms globules and pillars at the edge of the HII region. However, the\nrelative luminosity of ionising and non-ionising radiation has a much larger\ninfluence than the presence or absence of the B field. When the radiation field\nis relatively soft (as in the case of a lower mass cluster, with earliest\nspectral type of B0.5), then fragmentation is less vigorous and a thick,\nrelatively smooth PDR forms.

We take into account saturated electron\nthermal conductivity and Bremsstrahlung energy losses of two temperature plasma\nfor density and temperature near the Bondi radius similar to those observed in\nM87 galaxy. Joint action of electron thermal conductivity and free-free\nradiation leads to the effective cooling of accreting plasma and formation of\nthe subsonic settling of accreting gas above the zone of a centrifugal barrier.\nA toroidal condensation and a hollow funnel that separates the torus from the\nblack hole emerge near the barrier.

Existence of the centrifugal\nbarrier leads to significant decrease of the accretion rate dM/dt in comparison\nwith the critical Bondi solution for gamma=5/3.

The dominant production sites in such events were\nrecently investigated by using stellar model calculations: explosive\nneon-carbon burning, convective shell carbon burning, and convective core\nhydrogen burning. Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations are performed\nfor each of these sites by adopting temperature-density-time profiles from\nrecent stellar evolution models. For each profile, we individually multiplied\nthe rates of all relevant reactions by factors of 10, 2, 0.5 and 0.1, and\nanalyzed the resulting abundance changes of 26Al. Our simulations are based on\na next-generation nuclear physics library, called STARLIB, which contains a\nrecent evaluation of Monte Carlo reaction rates. Particular attention is paid\nto quantifying the rate uncertainties of those reactions that most sensitively\ninfluence 26Al production. For stellar modelers our results indicate to what\ndegree predictions of 26Al nucleosynthesis depend on currently uncertain\nnuclear physics input, while for nuclear experimentalists our results represent\na guide for future measurements. We tabulate the results of our reaction rate\nsensitivity study for each of the three distinct massive star sites referred to\nabove. It is found that several current reaction rate uncertainties influence\nthe production of 26Al. Particularly important reactions are 26Al(n,p)26Mg,\n25Mg(alpha,n)28Si, 24Mg(n,gamma)25Mg and 23Na(alpha,p)26Mg. These reactions\nshould be prime targets for future measurements. Overall, we estimate that the\nnuclear physics uncertainty of the 26Al yield predicted by the massive star\nmodels explored here amounts to about a factor of 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2011 15:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In this\narticle we develop a general criterion for the discrimination of pure N-partite\nentangled states in terms of polynomial SL(d,C) invariants. By means of this\ncriterion, existing SLOCC classifications of four-qubit entanglement are\nreproduced.
