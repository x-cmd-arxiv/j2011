It determines to what degree one can achieve a good\ntreatment plan quality in the subsequent plan optimization process. In this\npaper, we have developed a BOO algorithm via adaptive l_1 minimization.\nSpecifically, we introduce a sparsity energy function term into our model which\ncontains weighting factors for each beam angle adaptively adjusted during the\noptimization process. Such an energy term favors small number of beam angles.\nBy optimizing a total energy function containing a dosimetric term and the\nsparsity term, we are able to identify the unimportant beam angles and\ngradually remove them without largely sacrificing the dosimetric objective. In\none typical prostate case, the convergence property of our algorithm, as well\nas the how the beam angles are selected during the optimization process, is\ndemonstrated. Fluence map optimization (FMO) is then performed based on the\noptimized beam angles.

The quantitative impact of the proposed elastic collisions on\nstructure formation has been estimated previously by Monte Carlo N-body\nsimulations and by a conducting fluid model, with apparently diverging results.\nTo improve this situation, we make direct comparisons between new Monte Carlo\nN-body simulations and solutions of the conducting fluid model, for isolated\nSIDM haloes of fixed mass. This allows us to separate cleanly the effects of\ngravothermal relaxation from those of continuous mass accretion in an expanding\nbackground universe. When these two methods were previously applied to halo\nformation with cosmological boundary conditions, they disagreed by an order of\nmagnitude about the size of the scattering cross section required to solve the\nso-called 'cusp-core problem.' We show here, however, that the methods agree\nwith each other within 20 per cent for isolated haloes. This suggests that the\ntwo methods are consistent, and that their disagreement for cosmological haloes\nis not caused by a breakdown of their validity.\n  The isolated haloes studied here undergo gravothermal collapse. We compare\nthe solutions calculated by these two methods for gravothermal collapse\nstarting from several initial conditions. This allows us to calibrate the heat\nconduction which accounts for the effect of elastic hard-sphere scattering in\nthe fluid model. The amount of tuning of the thermal conductivity parameters\nrequired to bring the two methods into close agreement for isolated haloes,\nhowever, is too small to explain the discrepancy found previously in the\ncosmological context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2011 22:14:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 19:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Very low intrinsic radiogenic\ncontamination of all detector components needs to be accompanied by the\nefficient identification of muons and of muon-induced backgrounds. Muons\nproduce unstable nuclei by spallation processes along their trajectory through\nthe detector whose decays can mimic the expected signals; for isotopes with\nhalf-lives longer than a few seconds, the dead time induced by a muon-related\nveto becomes unacceptably long, unless its application can be restricted to a\nsub-volume along the muon track.

A cluster accepting requests is to select an\nincoming one uniformly (if there are such) and merge with that cluster.\nEmpirical results by Fernandess and Malkhi suggested the protocol concludes in\nO(log n) rounds with high probability, whereas numerical estimates by Oded\nSchramm, based on an ingenious analytic approximation, suggested that the\ncoalescence time should be super-logarithmic. Our contribution is a rigorous\nstudy of the stochastic coalescence process with two consequences. First, we\nconfirm that the above process indeed requires super-logarithmic time w.h.p.,\nwhere the inefficient rounds are due to oversized clusters that occasionally\ndevelop. Second, we remedy this by showing that a simple modification produces\nan essentially optimal distributed protocol; if clusters favor their smallest\nincoming merge request then the process does terminate in O(log n) rounds\nw.h.p., and simulations show that the new protocol readily outperforms the\noriginal one. Our upper bound hinges on a potential function involving the\nlogarithm of the number of clusters and the cluster-susceptibility, carefully\nchosen to form a supermartingale.

Inside each scale and during the lifetime of the cloud on that scale,\nsmaller regions come and go in a hierarchy of time. As a result, cluster\npositions are correlated with power law functions, and so are their ages. At\nthe lowest level in the hierarchy, clusters are observed to form in pairs. For\nany hierarchy like this, the efficiency is automatically highest in the densest\nregions. This high efficiency promotes bound cluster formation.

This order allows the same atomic proposition to have\ndifferent values depending on which atomic propositions have already been\nevaluated. In the sequential propositional logic discussed in this thesis, such\nvaluations are called \"reactive\" valuations, in contrast to \"static\" valuations\nas are common in e.g. ordinary propositional logic. There are many classes of\nthese reactive valuations e.g., we can define a class of reactive valuations\nsuch that the value for each atomic proposition remains the same until another\natomic proposition is evaluated. This Master of Logic thesis consists of a\nstudy of some of the properties of this logic. We take a closer look at some of\nthe classes of reactive valuations. We particularly focus on the relation\nbetween the axiomatization and the semantics. Consequently, the main part of\nthis thesis focuses on proving soundness and completeness. Furthermore, we show\nthat the axioms in the provided axiomatizations are independent i.e., there are\nno redundant axioms present. Finally, we show {\\omega}-completeness for two\nclasses of reactive valuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 07:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-18"}

We consider a box full\nof entropy lowered towards and then dropped into a $(D+1)$-dimensional black\nhole in equilibrium with thermal radiation. In the canonical case of three\nspatial dimensions, it was previously established that due to quantum buoyancy\neffects the box floats at some neutral point very close to the horizon. We find\nhere that the significance of quantum buoyancy increases dramatically with the\nnumber $D$ of spatial dimensions. In particular, we find that the neutral\n(floating) point of the box lies near the horizon only if its length $b$ is\nlarge enough such that $b/b_C>F(D)$, where $b_C$ is the Compton length of the\nbody and $F(D)\\sim D^{D/2}\\gg1$ for $D\\gg1$.

Using simple energy-balance models, it was suggested a few decades ago\nthat the meridional energy fluxes might follow a thermodynamic Maximum Entropy\nProduction (MEP) principle. In the present study, we assess the MEP hypothesis\nin the framework of a minimal climate model based solely on a robust radiative\nscheme and the MEP principle, with no extra assumptions. Specifically, we show\nthat by choosing an adequate radiative exchange formulation, the Net Exchange\nFormulation, a rigorous derivation of all the physical parameters can be\nperformed. The MEP principle is also extended to surface energy fluxes, in\naddition to meridional energy fluxes. The climate model presented here is\nextremely fast, needs very little empirical data and does not rely on ad hoc\nparameterizations. We investigate its range of validity by comparing its\nperformances for pre-industrial climate and Last Glacial Maximum climate with\ncorresponding simulations with the IPSL coupled atmosphere-ocean General\nCirculation Model IPSL_CM4, finding reasonable agreement. Beyond the practical\ninterest of this result for climate modelling, it supports the idea that, to a\ncertain extent, climate can be characterized with macroscale features with no\nneed to compute the underlying microscale dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 10:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The experimentally observed degree of coherence of the\nstrong-field-generated Kr+ ions is well reproduced by a recently developed\nmultichannel strong-field-ionization theory. But there is significant\ndisagreement between experiment and theory with respect to the degree of\nalignment of the Kr+ ions. In the present paper, the theory underlying\nattosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of strong-field-generated ions is\ndeveloped. The theory is formulated in such a way that the nonperturbative\nnature of the strong-field-ionization process is systematically taken into\naccount. The impact of attosecond pulse propagation effects on the\ninterpretation of experimental data is investigated both analytically and\nnumerically.

The network consists of three nodes, all having access to a\ncommon channel with half-duplex constraint. Two nodes want to establish a\ndialog while the third node can assist in the bi-directional transmission\nprocess. All nodes have agreed on a transmission protocol a priori and the\nproblem is restricted to the dialog encoders not being allowed to establish a\ncooperation by the use of previous receive signals. The channel is referred to\nas the restricted half-duplex two-way relay channel. Here the channel is\ndefined and an outer bound on the achievable rates is derived by the\napplication of the cut-set theorem. This shows that the problem consists of six\nparts. We propose a transmission protocol which takes into account all possible\ntransmit-receive configurations of the network and performs partial decoding of\nthe messages at the relay as well as sequential decoding at the dialog nodes.\nBy the use of random codes and suboptimal decoders, two inner bound on the\nachievable rates are derived. Restricting to the suggested strategies and fixed\ninput distributions it is argued to be possible to determine optimal\ntransmission schemes with respect to various reasonable objectives at low\ncomplexity.

The analysis of the\nspeed of scintillation developed recently by V.~Kornilov will lead to more\naccurate measurements of the AO time constant with MASS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 13:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This\nmethod uses the quasi-two-layer model of hydrodynamic flows over a stepwise\nboundary with advanced consideration of the flow features near the step. A\ndistinctive feature of the suggested model is a separation of a studied flow\ninto two layers in calculating flow quantities near each step, and improving by\nthis means approximation of depth-averaged solutions of the initial\nthree-dimensional Euler equations. We are solving the shallow-water equations\nfor one layer, introducing the fictitious lower layer only as an auxiliary\nstructure in setting up the appropriate Riemann problems for the upper layer.\nBesides quasi-two-layer approach leads to appearance of additional terms in\none-layer finite-difference representation of balance equations. These terms\nprovide the mechanical work made by nonhomogeneous bed interacting with flow. A\nnotable advantage of the proposed method is the consideration of the properties\nof the process of the waterfall, namely the fluid flow on the step in which the\nfluid does not wet part of the vertical wall of the step. The presence of dry\nzones in the vertical part of the step indicates violation of the conditions of\nhydrostatic flow. The quasi-two-layer approach determines the size of the dry\nzone of the vertical component of the step. Consequently it gives an\nopportunity to figure out the amount of flow kinetic energy dissipation on\ncomplex boundary. Numerical simulations are performed based on the proposed\nalgorithm of various physical phenomena, such as a breakdown of the rectangular\nfluid column over an inclined plane, large-scale motion of fluid in the gravity\nfield in the presence of Coriolis force over an mounted obstacle on underlying\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 13:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 12:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-22"}

Similarly, the surface density of star\nformation rate peaks in the NW region of NGC 1569, reaching a value of about 4\nx 10^-6 M_sun yr^-1 pc^-2. The total star formation rate as estimated from the\nintegrated, dereddened Halpha luminosity is about 0.4 M_sun yr^-1, and the\ntotal supernova rate from the integrated, dereddened [FeII] luminosity is about\n0.005 yr^-1 (assuming a distance of 3.36 Mpc).

It is argued that their correlation and thus also\nfluctuations are sensitive to conditions prevailing at the anticipated\nparton-hadron phase boundary. Fluctuations of the $(\\mathrm{K}^+ +\n\\mathrm{K}^-)/(\\mathrm{p}+\\bar{\\mathrm{p}})$ and $\\mathrm{K}^+/\\mathrm{p}$\nratios have been measured for the first time by NA49 in central Pb+Pb\ncollisions at 5 SPS energies between $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 6.3 GeV and 17.3 GeV.\nBoth ratios exhibit a change of sign in $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$, a measure of\nnon-statistical fluctuations, around $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 8 GeV. Below this\nenergy, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$ is positive, indicating higher fluctuation\ncompared to a mixed event background sample, while for higher energies,\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$ is negative, indicating correlated emission of kaons\nand protons. The results are compared to UrQMD calculations which which give a\ngood description at the higher SPS energies, but fail to reproduce the\ntransition to positive values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 15:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 10:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-04"}
