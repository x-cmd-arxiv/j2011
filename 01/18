This property of 3D models can dramatically affect\nelemental abundances derived from temperature-sensitive spectral lines. We\ninvestigate whether the cool surface temperatures predicted by metal-poor 3D\nmodels can be ascribed to the approximated treatment of scattering in the\nradiative transfer. We use the Bifrost code to test three different ways to\nhandle scattering in 3D model atmospheres of metal-poor stars. First, we solve\nself-consistently the radiative transfer equation for a source function with a\ncoherent scattering term. Second, we solve the radiative transfer equation for\na Planckian source function, neglecting the contribution of continuum\nscattering to extinction in the optically thin layers; this has been the\ndefault mode in previous models of ours. Third, we treat scattering as pure\nabsorption everywhere, which is the standard case in CO5BOLD models. We find\nthat the second approach produces temperature structures with cool upper\nphotospheric layers very similar to the correct coherent scattering solution.\nIn contrast, treating scattering as pure absorption leads to significantly\nhotter and shallower temperature stratifications. The main differences in\ntemperature structure between our published models and those generated with the\nCO5BOLD code can be traced to the different treatments of scattering.\nNeglecting the contribution of continuum scattering to extinction in optically\nthin layers provides a good approximation to the full radiative transfer\nsolution for metal-poor stars.

The first\napproximation algorithm (Ghosh, 1987) involves decomposing P into O(n^4) cells\nthat are equivalence classes for visibility from the vertices of P. This\ndiscretized problem can then be treated as an instance of set cover and solved\nin O(n^5) time with a greedy O(log n)-approximation algorithm.

In order to separate a dwarf\ngalaxy from a globular cluster, we discuss other possible requirements, such as\na minimum size, a long two-body relaxation time, a satellite system, the\npresence of complex stellar populations and non-baryonic dark matter. We\nbriefly mention the implications of each of these definitions if they are\nadopted. Some special cases of objects with an ambiguous nature are also\ndiscussed. Finally, we give our favoured criteria, and in the spirit of a\n`collective wisdom', invite readers to vote on their preferred definition of a\ngalaxy via a dedicated website.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2011 10:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We utilize a\nthree-dimensional radiative transfer code, including a hierarchically clumped\nmedium, to study the earliest stages of super star cluster evolution. We\nexplore a range of parameter space in geometric sequences that mimic the\nevolution of an embedded super star cluster. The inclusion of a hierarchically\nclumped medium can make the envelope porous, in accordance with previous models\nand supporting observational evidence. The infrared luminosity inferred from\nobservations can differ by a factor of two from the true value in the clumpiest\nenvelopes depending on the viewing angle. The infrared spectral energy\ndistribution also varies with viewing angle for clumpy envelopes, creating a\nrange in possible observable infrared colors and magnitudes, silicate feature\ndepths and dust continua. General observable features of cluster evolution\ndiffer between envelopes that are relatively opaque or transparent to\nmid-infrared photons. The [70]-[160] color can be used to determine star\nformation efficiency; the Spitzer IRAC/MIPS [8.0]-[24] color is able to\nconstrain Rin and Rout values; and the IRAC [3.6]-[5.8] color is sensitive to\nthe fraction of the dust distributed in clumps.

Spiral density patterns develop in the circumbinary disc that\ntransport angular momentum efficiently.

However, in the inhomogeneous universe, even if\n<\\delta\\rho> =0, the distance relation is not the same as in the unperturbed\nuniverse. This can be of serious consequences as a change of distance affects\nthe mapping of CMB temperature fluctuations into the angular power spectrum. In\naddition, if the change of distance is relatively uniform no new temperature\nfluctuations are generated. It is therefore a different effect than the lensing\nor ISW effects which introduce additional CMB anisotropies. This paper shows\nthat the accuracy of the CMB analysis can be impaired by the accuracy of\ncalculation of the distance within the cosmological models. Since this effect\nhas not been fully explored before, to test how the inhomogeneities affect the\ndistance-redshift relation, several methods are examined: the Dyer-Roeder\nrelation, lensing approximation, and non-linear Swiss-Cheese model. In all\ncases, the distance to the last scattering surface is different than when\nhomogeneity is assumed. The difference can be as low as 1% and as high as 80%.\nExcluding extreme cases, the distance changes by about 20-30%. Since the\ndistance to the last scattering surface is set by the position of the CMB\npeaks, in order to have a good fit, the distance needs to be adjusted. After\ncorrecting the distance, the cosmological parameters change. Therefore, a not\nproperly estimated distance to the last scattering surface can be a major\nsource of systematics.

Recently, genome-wide screening for\ngenetic interactions has revealed genetic interaction networks that provide\nnovel insights either when analyzed by themselves or when integrated with other\nfunctional genomic datasets. For higher eukaryotes such as human, the above\nreverse-genetics approaches are not straightforward since the phenotypes of\ninterest for higher eukaryotes are difficult to study in a cell based assay. We\npropose a general framework for constructing and analyzing human genetic\ninteraction networks from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data\nused for case-control studies on complex diseases. Specifically, the approach\ncontains three major steps: (1) estimating SNP-SNP genetic interactions, (2)\nidentifying linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and mapping SNP-SNP interactions\nto block-block interactions, and (3) functional mapping for LD blocks. We\nperformed two sets of functional analyses for each of the six datasets used in\nthe paper, and demonstrated that (i) the constructed genetic interaction\nnetworks are supported by functional evidence from independent biological\ndatabases, and (ii) the network can be used to discover pairs of compensatory\ngene modules (between-pathway models) in their joint association with a disease\nphenotype. The proposed framework should provide novel insights beyond existing\napproaches that either ignore interactions between SNPs or model different\nSNP-SNP pairs with genetic interactions separately. Furthermore, our study\nprovides evidence that some of the core properties of genetic interaction\nnetworks based on reverse genetics in model organisms like yeast are also\npresent in genetic interactions revealed by natural variation in human\npopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 22:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Part of the appeal is\nsimplicity. BoF methods are based on orderless collections of quantized local\nimage descriptors; they discard spatial information and are therefore\nconceptually and computationally simpler than many alternative methods. Despite\nthis, or perhaps because of this, BoF-based systems have set new performance\nstandards on popular image classification benchmarks and have achieved\nscalability breakthroughs in image retrieval. This paper presents an\nintroduction to BoF image representations, describes critical design choices,\nand surveys the BoF literature. Emphasis is placed on recent techniques that\nmitigate quantization errors, improve feature detection, and speed up image\nretrieval. At the same time, unresolved issues and fundamental challenges are\nraised. Among the unresolved issues are determining the best techniques for\nsampling images, describing local image features, and evaluating system\nperformance. Among the more fundamental challenges are how and whether BoF\nmethods can contribute to localizing objects in complex images, or to\nassociating high-level semantics with natural images. This survey should be\nuseful both for introducing new investigators to the field and for providing\nexisting researchers with a consolidated reference to related work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 23:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-19"}

For {\\em admissible} partial orders,\na complete proof of the correctness of the algorithm based on this generalized\ncriterion is also presented.

In order to cope with the high frequency of\nspontaneous and induced DNA damage, a multitude of repair mechanisms have\nevolved. These are enabled by a wide range of protein factors specifically\nrecognizing different types of lesions and finally restoring the normal DNA\nsequence. This work focuses on the repair factor XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum\ncomplementation group C), which identifies bulky DNA lesions and initiates\ntheir removal via the nucleotide excision repair pathway. The binding of XPC to\ndamaged DNA can be visualized in living cells by following the accumulation of\na fluorescent XPC fusion at lesions induced by laser microirradiation in a\nfluorescence microscope. In this work, an automated image processing pipeline\nis presented which allows to identify and quantify the accumulation reaction\nwithout any user interaction. The image processing pipeline comprises a\npreprocessing stage where the image stack data is filtered and the nucleus of\ninterest is segmented. Afterwards, the images are registered to each other in\norder to account for movements of the cell, and then a bounding box enclosing\nthe XPC-specific signal is automatically determined. Finally, the\ntime-dependent relocation of XPC is evaluated by analyzing the intensity change\nwithin this box. Comparison of the automated processing results with the manual\nevaluation yields qualitatively similar results. However, the automated\nanalysis provides more accurate, reproducible data with smaller standard\nerrors.

To do so, we have simulated the orbital evolution of planets,\nincluding the effects of stellar tide and mass loss, to determine the critical\nsemimajor axis, a_crit, beyond which planets survive the RGB expansion of their\nhost star.

Although such techniques\nhave been developed, these approaches have not been used with GSEA to any\nsignificant degree because of the large number of potential gene combinations\nand the heterogeneity of measures that assess the differentiation provided by\ngene groups of different sizes.\n  To integrate the search for differentiating gene combinations and GSEA, we\npropose a general framework with two key components: (A) a procedure that\nreduces the number of scores to be handled by GSEA to the number of genes by\nsummarizing the scores of the gene combinations involving a particular gene in\na single score, and (B) a procedure to integrate the heterogeneous scores from\ncombinations of different sizes and from different gene combination measures by\nmapping the scores to p-values. Experiments on four gene expression data sets\ndemonstrate that the integration of GSEA and gene combination search can\nenhance the power of traditional GSEA by discovering gene sets that include\ngenes with weak individual differentiation but strong joint discriminative\npower. Also, gene sets discovered by the integrative framework share several\ncommon biological processes and improve the consistency of the results among\nthree lung cancer data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 15:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-19"}
