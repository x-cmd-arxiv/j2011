I then use SZA\nobservations to investigate the utility of a new, self-similar pressure profile\nfor fitting SZE observations of galaxy clusters (Part II).\n  The SZA 30-GHz receiver system probes angular scales ~1-5'. A model that can\naccurately describe a cluster's pressure profile over a correspondingly broad\nrange of radii is therefore required. In the analysis presented here, I fit a\n2-parameter, radial pressure profile, derived from simulations and detailed X-\nray analysis of relaxed clusters, to SZA observations of three clusters with\nexceptionally high quality X-ray data. From the joint analysis of the SZE and\nX-ray data, I derive physical properties of the cluster, such as gas and total\nmass, gas fraction and the integrated Compton y -parameter.\n  The parameters derived from the joint fit to SZE+X-ray data agree well with a\ndetailed, independent, X-ray-only analysis of these same clusters. When\ncombined with X-ray imaging data, this new pressure profile yields an\nindependent estimate of the electron temperature profile that is in good\nagreement with spectroscopic X-ray determinations. In addition to yielding\nrelationships between cluster observables and physical cluster properties, this\nmodel could prove to be a useful tool in helping to constrain the temperatures\nof high redshift clusters, for which X-ray spectroscopic data are difficult to\nobtain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2011 21:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-28"}

The\nconfiguration of the gauge field that generates a Rashba type spin-orbit\ninteraction is described by three coupling parameters $(\\lambda_x, \\lambda_y,\n\\lambda_z)$. For a generic gauge field configuration, the critical scattering\nlength required for the formation of a bound state is {\\em negative}, i.e.\nshifts to the \"BCS side\" of the resonance. Interestingly, we find that there\nare special high-symmetry configurations (e.g., $\\lambda_x = \\lambda_y =\n\\lambda_z$) for which there is a two body bound state for {\\em any} scattering\nlength however small and negative. Remarkably, the bound-state wave functions\nobtained for such configurations have nematic spin structure similar to those\nfound in liquid $^3$He. Our results show that the BCS-BEC crossover is\ndrastically affected by the presence of a non-Abelian gauge field. We discuss\npossible experimental signatures of our findings both at high and low\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2011 15:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2011 09:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
