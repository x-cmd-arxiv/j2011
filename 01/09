Traditionally,\nrelay selection approaches are primarily focused on selecting one relay node to\nimprove the transmission reliability given a single-antenna destination node.\nAs such, in the cooperative phase whereby both the source and the selected\nrelay nodes transmit to the destination node, it is only feasible to exploit\ncooperative spatial diversity (for example by means of distributed space time\ncoding). For wireless systems with a multi-antenna destination node, in the\ncooperative phase it is possible to opportunistically transmit multiple data\nstreams to the destination node by utilizing multiple relay nodes. Therefore,\nwe propose a low overhead multi-relay selection protocol to support\nmulti-stream cooperative communications. In addition, we derive the asymptotic\nperformance results at high SNR for the proposed scheme and discuss the\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff as well as the throughput-reliability tradeoff.\nFrom these results, we show that the proposed multi-stream cooperative\ncommunication scheme achieves lower outage probability compared to existing\nbaseline schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2011 15:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The sample comprises 12 and 41 bursts with and without\nextended emission (EE) components, respectively. IPCs of non-EE bursts are\ndominated by single pulse structures, while EE bursts tend to have two or more\npulse structures. The medians of characteristic timescales - durations, pulse\nstructure widths, and peak intervals - for EE bursts are factors of ~ 2-3\nlonger than for non-EE bursts. A trend previously reported by Hakkila and\ncolleagues unifying long and short bursts - the anti-correlation of pulse\nintensity and width - continues in the two short burst groups, with non-EE\nbursts extending to more intense, narrower pulses. In addition we find that\npreceding and succeeding pulse intensities are anti-correlated with pulse\ninterval. We also examine the short burst X-ray afterglows as observed by the\nSwift/XRT. The median flux of the initial XRT detections for EE bursts (~ 6 x\n10^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1) is ~> 20 x brighter than for non-EE bursts, and the\nmedian X-ray afterglow duration for EE bursts (~ 60,000 s) is ~ 30 x longer\nthan for non-EE bursts.\n  The tendency for EE bursts toward longer prompt-emission timescales and\nhigher initial X-ray afterglow fluxes implies larger energy injections powering\nthe afterglows. The longer-lasting X-ray afterglows of EE bursts may suggest\nthat a significant fraction explode into more dense environments than non-EE\nbursts, or that the sometimes-dominant EE component efficiently powers the\nafterglow. Combined, these results favor different progenitors for EE and\nnon-EE short bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2011 15:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 23:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
