((2010), PLoS ONE 5(3): e9621.\ndoi:10.1371/ journal.pone.0009621) ant motion out of the nest is shown to be a\nnon-stationary process intriguingly similar to the dynamics encountered in\n\\emph{physical aging} of glassy systems. Specifically, exit events can be\ndescribed as a Poisson process in logarithmic time, or, for short, a\nlog-Poisson process. Nouvellet et al.(J. Theor. Biol. 266, 573. (2010))\ncriticized these conclusions and performed new experiments where the exit\nprocess could more simply be described by standard Poisson statistics. In their\nreply, (J Theor. Biol. 269, 356-358 (2011)) Richardson et al. stressed that the\ntwo sets of experiments were performed under very different conditions and\nclaimed that this was the likely source of the discrepancy. The focal point of\nthis work is whether log-Poisson and Poisson statistics both are possible under\ndifferent external conditions. To this end, a model is introduced where\ninteracting ants move in a stochastic fashion from one site to a neighboring\nsite on a finite 2D lattice. The probability of each move is determined by the\nensuing changes of a utility function which is a sum of pairwise interactions\nbetween ants, weighted by distance. Depending on how the interactions are\ndefined and on a control parameter dubbed 'degree of stochasticity' (DS), the\ndynamics either quickly converges to a stationary state, where movements are a\nstandard Poisson process, or may enter a non-stationary regime, where exits can\nbe described as suggested by Richardson et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 16:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 11:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

A specific example of this is seen in solutions of lipid\nmixtures where the two species form lamellar structures and spherical micelles\nrespectively. Here, vesicles connected by thread-like micelles can form in a\nnarrow concentration range of the sphere-forming lipid. We present a\nself-consistent field theory (SCFT) study of these structures. Firstly, we show\nthat the addition of sphere-forming lipid to a solution of lamella-former can\nlower the free energy of cylindrical, thread-like micelles and hence encourage\ntheir formation. Next, we demonstrate the coupling between composition and\ncurvature; specifically, that increasing the concentration of sphere-former in\na system of two bilayers connected by a thread leads to a transfer of\namphiphile to the thread. We further show that the two species are segregated\nwithin the structure, with the concentration of sphere-former being\nsignificantly higher in the thread. Finally, the addition of larger amounts of\nsphere-former is found to destabilize the junctions linking the bilayers to the\ncylindrical micelle, leading to a breakdown of the connected structures. The\ndegree of segregation of the amphiphiles and the amount of sphere-former\nrequired to destabilize the junctions is shown to be sensitive to the length of\nthe hydrophilic block of the sphere-forming amphiphiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 16:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Traditional orthogonal signaling ignores\nthe random nature of user activity in this problem and limits the total number\nof users to be on the order of the number of signal space dimensions.\nContention-based schemes, on the other hand, suffer from delays caused by\ncolliding transmissions and the hidden node problem. In contrast, this paper\npresents a novel pairing of an asynchronous non-orthogonal code-division random\naccess scheme with a convex optimization-based MUD algorithm that overcomes the\nissues associated with orthogonal signaling and contention-based methods. Two\nkey distinguishing features of the proposed MUD algorithm are that it does not\nrequire knowledge of the delay or channel state information of every user and\nit has polynomial-time computational complexity. The main analytical\ncontribution of this paper is the relationship between the performance of the\nproposed MUD algorithm in the presence of arbitrary or random delays and two\nsimple metrics of the set of user codewords. The study of these metrics is then\nfocused on two specific sets of codewords, random binary codewords and\nspecially constructed algebraic codewords, for asynchronous random access.

Illustrative examples of physical models using a Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer code show that the rising neon ratio may be explained by\nadding a vertically extended, hot stellar source to a thin disk of massive\nstars.

To accurately reproduce the tidal evolution of a system at\nseparations less than five times the radius of the larger primary component,\nthe tidal potential due to the presence of a smaller secondary component is\nexpanded in terms of Legendre polynomials to arbitrary order rather than\ntruncated at leading order as is typically done in studies of well-separated\nsystem like the Earth and Moon. The equations of tidal evolution including\ntidal torques, the changes in spin rates of the components, and the change in\nsemimajor axis (orbital separation) are then derived for binary asteroid\nsystems with circular and equatorial mutual orbits. Accounting for higher-order\nterms in the tidal potential serves to speed up the tidal evolution of the\nsystem leading to underestimates in the time rates of change of the spin rates,\nsemimajor axis, and mean motion in the mutual orbit if such corrections are\nignored. Special attention is given to the effect of close orbits on the\ncalculation of material properties of the components, in terms of the rigidity\nand tidal dissipation function, based on the tidal evolution of the system. It\nis found that accurate determinations of the physical parameters of the system,\ne.g., densities, sizes, and current separation, are typically more important\nthan accounting for higher-order terms in the potential when calculating\nmaterial properties. In the scope of the long-term tidal evolution of the\nsemimajor axis and the component spin rates, correcting for close orbits is a\nsmall effect, but for an instantaneous rate of change in spin rate, semimajor\naxis, or mean motion, the close-orbit correction can be on the order of tens of\npercent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 18:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The physical\norigin of the effect has been a puzzle ever since its discovery over a hundred\nyears ago. We build here upon the recent observational and theoretical work of\nSzabo et al. on RRab stars who found with hydrodynamical simulations that the\nfundamental pulsation mode can get destabilized by a 9:2 resonant interaction\nwith the 9th overtone. Alternating pulsation cycles arise, although these\nremain periodic, i.e. not modulated as in the observations.\n  Here we use the amplitude equation formalism to study this nonlinear,\nresonant interaction between the two modes. We show that not only does the\nfundamental pulsation mode break up into a period two cycle through the\nnonlinear, resonant interaction with the overtone, but that the amplitudes are\nmodulated, and that in a broad range of parameters the modulations are\nirregular as in the observations. This irregular behavior is in fact chaotic\nand arises from a strange attractor in the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 19:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The continuum-subtracted H_2 image is used to identify\noutflows. The data obtained in this study are used in conjunction with Spitzer,\nAKARI, and IRAS data. A parsec-scale bipolar outflow is discovered in our H_2\nline image, which is supported by the detection in the archival Spitzer images.\nThe H_2 image exhibits signs of precession of the main jet and shows tentative\nevidence for a second outflow. These suggest the possibility of a companion to\nthe outflow source. There is a strong component of continuum emission in the\ndirection of the outflow, which supports the idea that the outflow cavity\nprovides a path for radiation to escape, thereby reducing the radiation\npressure on the accreted matter. The bulk of the emission observed close to the\noutflow in the WFCAM and Spitzer bands is rotated counter clockwise with\nrespect to the outflow traced in H_2, which may be due to precession. The YSO\ndriving the outflow is identified in the Spitzer images. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the YSO is studied using available radiative transfer\nmodels.

(2007 Science 315, 966), which represents a realization of\nWheeler's delayed-choice Gedankenexperiment. Our analysis is based on the\nevolution of the photon state, since the photon enters into the Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer with a removable beam-splitter until it exits. Given the same\nincident photon state onto the output beam-splitter, BS_output, the photon's\nstate at the exit will be very different depending on whether BS_output is on\nor off. Hence, the statistics of photon counts collected by the two detectors,\npositioned along orthogonal directions at the exit of the interferometer, is\nalso going to be very different in either case. Therefore, it is not that the\nchoice of inserting (on) or removing (off) a beam-splitter leads to a delayed\ninfluence on the photon behavior before arriving at the beam-splitter, but that\nsuch a choice influences the photon state at and after BS_output, i.e., after\nit has exited from the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The random on/off choice at\nBS_output has no delayed effect on the photon to behave as a wave or a\ncorpuscle at the entrance and inside the interferometer, but influences the\nsubsequent evolution of the photon state incident onto BS_output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 19:41:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 07:54:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 21:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 16:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We confirm\nand extend the BLAST analysis of clustering with an independent pipeline, and\nalso detect correlations between the ACT and BLAST maps at over 25sigma\nsignificance, which we interpret as a detection of the DSFGs in the ACT maps.\nIn addition to a Poisson component in the cross-frequency power spectra, we\ndetect a clustered signal at >4sigma, and using a model for the DSFG evolution\nand number counts, we successfully fit all our spectra with a linear clustering\nmodel and a bias that depends only on redshift and not on scale. Finally, the\ndata are compared to, and generally agree with, phenomenological models for the\nDSFG population. This study represents a first of its kind, and demonstrates\nthe constraining power of the cross-frequency correlation technique to\nconstrain models for the DSFGs. Similar analyses with more data will impose\ntight constraints on future models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 20:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This environment suppresses the formation of a retrograde\nrotating cloud population, with 88% of the clouds rotating prograde with\nrespect to the galaxy after 300 Myr. The diffuse heating also reduces the\ninitial star formation rate, slowing the conversation of gas into stars. We\ntherefore conclude that the interstellar environment plays an important role in\nthe GMCs evolution.

The empirical donor mass-radius relationship also shows a\ndiscontinuity at M_2 = 0.2 M_sun which neatly separates long- and short-period\nCVs. This is strong confirmation of the basic disrupted magnetic braking\nscenario for CV evolution. The empirical M_2-R_2 relation can be combined with\nstellar models to construct a complete, semi-empirical donor sequence for CVs.\nThis sequence provides all physical and photometric properties of \"normal\" CV\nsecondaries along the standard CV evolution track. The observed donor\nproperties can also be used to reconstruct the complete evolution track\nfollowed by CVs, i.e. the mass-transfer rate and angular-momentum-loss rate as\na function of orbital period.

They define, in particular, an\norientation of the domain boundaries and stabilizing or destabilizing effect of\ninhomogeneous elastic strains on the single domain state. We apply the general\nresults to perovskite systems like BaTiO3/SrRuO3/SrTiO3 films and find that at\nleast not far from the ferroelectric phase transition the equilibrium domain\nstructure consists of the stripes along the cubic axes or at 45 degrees to\nthem. We have also showed that in this system the inhomogeneous strains\nincrease stability with regards to the small fluctuations of the metastable\nsingle domain state, which may exist not very close to the ferroelectric\ntransition.

Yet the conditions in which they form and collapse are still not\nfully understood. In particular, the influence of the magnetic field on the\ncollapse of massive clumps is relatively unexplored, it is thus of great\nrelevance in the context of the formation of massive stars to investigate its\nimpact. We perform high resolution, MHD simulations of the collapse of hundred\nsolar masses, turbulent and magnetized clouds, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code RAMSES. We compute various quantities such as mass\ndistribution, magnetic field and angular momentum within the collapsing core\nand study the episodic outflows and the fragmentation that occurs during the\ncollapse. The magnetic field has a drastic impact on the cloud evolution. We\nfind that magnetic braking is able to substantially reduce the angular momentum\nin the inner part of the collapsing cloud. Fast and episodic outflows are being\nlaunched with typical velocities of the order of 3-5 km s$^{-1}$ although the\nhighest velocities can be as high as 30-40 km s$^{-1}$. The fragmentation in\nseveral objects, is reduced in substantially magnetized clouds with respect to\nhydrodynamical ones by a factor of the order of 1.5-2. We conclude that\nmagnetic fields have a significant impact on the evolution of massive clumps.\nIn combination with radiation, magnetic fields largely determine the outcome of\nmassive core collapse. We stress that numerical convergence of MHD collapse is\na challenging issue. In particular, numerical diffusion appears to be important\nat high density therefore possibly leading to an over-estimation of the number\nof fragments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2011 08:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 17:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

There is a variation of about a factor\nof two between the two clouds. We find evidence for a modest decrease of\nSigma_CO/Sigma_SMF with increasing mass surface density, which may be due to a\nsystematic decrease in temperature, increase in importance of high 13CO opacity\ncores, increase in dust opacity, or decrease in 13CO abundance due to depletion\nin regions of higher column density. We perform ellipsoidal and filamentary\nvirial analyses of the clouds, finding that the surface pressure terms are\ndynamically important and that globally the filaments may not yet have reached\nvirial equilibrium.
