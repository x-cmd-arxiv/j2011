Degassing of CO2 at mid-ocean ridges may\ngive information on the source region but the very low solubility of CO2 in\ntholeitic basalts has for consequence that near all Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts\nglasses exsolve their CO2 rich vapor at shallow depth as they approach the\nocean floor. Hence their CO2 contents mostly represent the pressure at eruption\nand not the source region. Recent petrological investigations have shown that\nthe presence of carbonates at depth in the upper mantle has a large effect on\nthe solidus of carbonated silicates by inducing incipient melting at much lower\ntemperature. So the role of carbon-rich melts at great depth is now becoming a\ncredible scenario to explain the extraction of CO2 from the source region to\nthe surface. During the last three decades many studies have been devoted to\nmeasure the solubility of CO2 in silicate melts of various composition. But due\nto experimental difficulties these studies were generally restricted to low and\nmoderate pressures (below ~20 kbar). By performing a series of molecular\ndynamics simulation where a supercritical CO2 phase is in contact with a\nsilicate melt of various composition (from felsic to ultrabasic) at different\ntemperatures (1473-2273K) and pressures (20-150kbar), we have been able to\nevaluate the solubility of CO2, the population of molecular and carbonate\nspecies, their diffusivity through the melt and the local structure. We show\nthat this kind of molecular simulation is a useful theoretical guide to better\nunderstand the behavior of CO2 in magmas at depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 16:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The effect is widely used to separate\nmacromolecules, to assemble colloidal structures, to transport particles in\nnano- and micro-fluidic devices and displays. Typically, the fluid is isotropic\n(for example, water) and the electrophoretic velocity is linearly proportional\nto the electric field. In linear electrophoresis, only a direct current (DC)\nfield can drive the particles. An alternate current (AC) field is more\ndesirable because it allows one to overcome problems such as electrolysis and\nabsence of steady flows. Here we show that when the electrophoresis is\nperformed in a nematic fluid, the effect becomes strongly non-linear with a\nvelocity component that is quadratic in the applied voltage and has a direction\nthat generally differs from the direction of linear velocity. The new\nphenomenon is caused by distortions of the LC orientation around the particle\nthat break the fore-aft (or left-right) symmetry.

It has been recently shown that because there\nare not enough magnetic channels, classical interpolation methods fail to\nderive reliable measurements at the positions of the test masses, while neural\nnetwork interpolation can provide the required measurements at the desired\naccuracy. In this paper we expand these studies and we assess the reliability\nand robustness of the neural network interpolation scheme for variations of the\nlocations and possible offsets of the magnetometers, as well as for changes in\nenvironmental conditions. We find that neural networks are robust enough to\nderive accurate measurements of the magnetic field at the positions of the test\nmasses in most circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 16:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In this work, we relied on the fact that the Dyson-Schwinger\nequations used by the authors stem from a variational principle and tried to\nreproduce their results by a mere variational algorithm. We were able to\nreproduce exactly their results by the employment of two different variational\ncalculations of the vacuum energy in the proposed theory. We showed that the\ntwo vacuum solutions obtained by the authors of the commented letter correspond\nto two non-degenerate vacuum energies except for the $d=0$ space-time\ndimensions where the vacuum states are degenerate. Since any variational\ncalculation of the vacuum energy should be higher than the true (exact) vacuum\nenergy, the most accurate result will correspond to the vacuum that lowers the\nvacuum energy. We showed that the vacuum with unbroken $Z_{2}$ symmetry has\nlower energy than the vacuum with broken $Z_{2}$ symmetry.

These reactions proceed through the same 61Ni\nnucleus at the same excitation energy, thus allowing the difference in reaction\nmechanism to be studied. It is shown that spectra from the first reaction\nmeasured at backward angles are due to emission from a traditional compound\nnucleus reaction, in which the intermediate nucleus has reached statistical\nequilibrium; the spectra from the second reaction contain a significant\nfraction of pre-equilibrium emission at all angles. Level density pa- rameters\nof the residual nucleus 60Co have been obtained from the first reaction. Both\nemission spectra and angular distributions have been measured for the second\nreaction. It was found that the pre-equilibrium component exhibits a\nforward-peaked angular distribution, as expected, but with a steeper slope than\npredicted and with an unusual slight rise at angles above 120\\deg.

In fact, the strategy decision system becomes a key component\nof a game engine. Determining the way in which decisions are taken (online,\nbatch or simulated) and the consumed resources in decision making (e.g.\nexecution time, memory) will influence, in mayor degree, the game performance.\nWhen classical search algorithms such as A* can be used, they are the very\nfirst option. Nevertheless, such methods rely on precise and complete models of\nthe search space, and there are many interesting scenarios where their\napplication is not possible. Then, model free methods for sequential decision\nmaking under uncertainty are the best choice. In this paper, we propose a\nheuristic planning strategy to incorporate the ability of heuristic-search in\npath-finding into a Dyna agent. The proposed Dyna-H algorithm, as A* does,\nselects branches more likely to produce outcomes than other branches. Besides,\nit has the advantages of being a model-free online reinforcement learning\nalgorithm. The proposal was evaluated against the one-step Q-Learning and\nDyna-Q algorithms obtaining excellent experimental results: Dyna-H\nsignificantly overcomes both methods in all experiments.

In contrast if one is scattering\nwaves (whether we are dealing with either purely classical waves or quantum\nSchrodinger wavefunctions) each sub-barrier contributes phase information (as\nwell as a transmission probability), and these phases can lead to either\nconstructive or destructive interference, with the transmission probability\noscillating between nontrivial upper and lower bounds.

Our\nmodels are rooted in the microscopic description of a random (discrete)\npopulation of individuals characterized by one or several adaptive traits and\ncells characterized by their type. The population is modeled as a stochastic\npoint process whose generator captures the probabilistic dynamics over\ncontinuous time of birth, mutation and death for individuals and birth and\ndeath for cells.

Precision weak lensing measurements\nrequire an understanding of the intrinsic alignment of galaxy ellipticities,\nwhich can in turn inform models of galaxy formation. It is hypothesized that\nelliptical galaxies align with the background tidal field and that this\nalignment mechanism dominates the correlation between ellipticities on\ncosmological scales (in the absence of lensing). We use recent large-scale\nstructure measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to test this picture\nwith several statistics: (1) the correlation between ellipticity and galaxy\noverdensity, w_{g+}; (2) the intrinsic alignment auto-correlation functions;\n(3) the correlation functions of curl-free, E, and divergence-free, B, modes\n(the latter of which is zero in the linear tidal alignment theory); (4) the\nalignment correlation function, w_g(r_p,theta), a recently developed statistic\nthat generalizes the galaxy correlation function to account for the angle\nbetween the galaxy separation vector and the principle axis of ellipticity. We\nshow that recent measurements are largely consistent with the tidal alignment\nmodel and discuss dependence on galaxy luminosity. In addition, we show that at\nlinear order the tidal alignment model predicts that the angular dependence of\nw_g(r_p,theta) is simply w_{g+}*cos(2*theta) and that this dependence is\nconsistent with recent measurements. We also study how stochastic nonlinear\ncontributions to galaxy ellipticity impact these statistics. We find that a\nsignificant fraction of the observed LRG ellipticity can be explained by\nalignment with the tidal field on scales >~10 h^-1 Mpc.

However, until now there has been no\nastrophysical motivation for considering a source highly enriched in heavy\nelements. Here we demonstrate that the outflows from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)\nmay indeed be composed primarily of nuclei with masses A ~ 40-200, which are\nsynthesized as hot material expands away from the central engine. In\nparticular, if the jet is magnetically-dominated (rather than a\nthermally-driven fireball) its low entropy enables heavy elements to form\nefficiently. Adopting the millisecond proto-magnetar model for the GRB central\nengine, we show that heavy nuclei are both synthesized in proto-magnetar winds\nand can in principle be accelerated to energies >1e20 eV in the shocks or\nregions of magnetic reconnection that are responsible for powering the GRB.\nSimilar results may apply to accretion-powered GRB models if the jet originates\nfrom a magnetized disk wind. Depending on the precise distribution of nuclei\nsynthesized, we predict that the average primary mass may continue to increase\nbeyond Fe group elements at the highest energies, possibly reaching the A ~ 90\n(Zirconium), A ~ 130 (Tellurium), or even A ~ 195 (Platinum) peaks. Future\nmeasurements of the UHECR composition at energies >~ 1e20 eV can thus confirm\nor constrain our model and, potentially, probe the nature of GRB outflows. The\nlonger attenuation length of ultra-heavy nuclei through the extragalactic\nbackground light greatly expands the volume of accesible sources and alleviates\nthe energetic constraints on GRBs as the source of UHECRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 17:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

A solution to the puzzle has been suggested to be that the neutral\nelements that experience the radiation force also are rapidly ionized, and so\nare only able to accelerate to an average limiting velocity v_ion. Once\nionized, the elements are rapidly braked by C II, which is observed to be at\nleast 20x overabundant in the disk with respect to other species. A prediction\nfrom this scenario is that different neutral elements should reach different\nv_ion, depending on the ionization thresholds and strengths of driving line\ntransitions. In particular, neutral Fe and Na are predicted to reach the radial\nvelocities 0.5 and 3.3 km/s, respectively, before being ionized. In this paper\nwe study the absorption profiles of Fe and Na from the circumstellar gas disk\naround beta Pic, as obtained by HARPS at the ESO 3.6m telescope. We find that\nthe Fe and Na velocity profiles are indeed shifted with respect to each other,\nconfirming the model. The absence of an extended blue wing in the profile of\nNa, however, indicates that there must be some additional braking on the\nneutrals. We explore the possibility that the ion gas (dominated by C II) can\nbrake the neutrals, and conclude that about 2-5x more C than previously\nestimated is needed for the predicted line profile to be consistent with the\nobserved one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 21:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Vertex corrections are expected\nto be important because of strongly momentum dependent self-energies. We use\nthe Two-Particle Self-Consistent approach that satisfies crucial constraints\nsuch as the Mermin-Wagner theorem, the Pauli principle and sum rules in order\nto reach non-perturbative regimes. This approach is reliable from weak to\nintermediate coupling. A functional derivative approach ensures that vertex\ncorrections are included in a way that satisfies the f sum-rule. The two types\nof vertex corrections that we find are the antiferromagnetic analogs of the\nMaki-Thompson and Aslamasov-Larkin contributions of superconducting\nfluctuations to the conductivity but, contrary to the latter, they include\nnon-perturbative effects. The resulting analytical expressions must be\nevaluated numerically. The calculations are impossible unless a number of\nadvanced numerical algorithms are used. A maximum entropy approach is specially\ndeveloped for analytical continuation of our results. The numerical results are\nfor nearest neighbor hoppings. In the pseudogap regime induced by\ntwo-dimensional antiferromagnetic fluctuations, the effect of vertex\ncorrections is dramatic. Without vertex corrections the resistivity increases\nas we enter the pseudogap regime. Adding vertex corrections leads to a drop in\nresistivity, as observed in some high temperature superconductors. At high\ntemperature, the resistivity saturates at the Ioffe-Regel limit. At the quantum\ncritical point and beyond, the resistivity displays both linear and quadratic\ntemperature dependence and there is a correlation between the linear term and\nthe superconducting transition temperature.

The probability that a random polygon of length $n$ has knot\ntype $K$ is $p_n(K)/p_n$ and is known to decay exponentially with length.\nLittle is known rigorously about the asymptotics of $p_n(K)$, but there is\nsubstantial numerical evidence that $p_n(K)$ grows as $p_n(K) \\simeq \\, C_K \\,\n\\mu_\\emptyset^n \\, n^{\\alpha-3+N_K}$, as $n \\to \\infty$, where $N_K$ is the\nnumber of prime components of the knot type $K$. It is believed that the\nentropic exponent, $\\alpha$, is universal, while the exponential growth rate,\n$\\mu_\\emptyset$, is independent of the knot type but varies with the lattice.\nThe amplitude, $C_K$, depends on both the lattice and the knot type.\n  The above asymptotic form implies that the relative probability of a random\npolygon of length $n$ having prime knot type $K$ over prime knot type $L$ is\n$\\frac{p_n(K)/p_n}{p_n(L)/p_n} = \\frac{p_n(K)}{p_n(L)} \\simeq [ \\frac{C_K}{C_L}\n]$.

It is found that the evolution of $E_{0,p}$\nalone can produce the observed lags. When $E_{0,p}$ varies from hard to soft\nonly the positive lags can be observed. The negative lags would occur in the\ncase of $E_{0,p}$ varying from soft to hard. When the evolution of $E_{0,p}$\nand the low-energy spectral index $\\alpha_{0}$ varying from soft to hard then\nto soft we can find the aforesaid two sorts of lags. We then examine the\ncombined case of the spectral evolution and the curvature effect of fireball\nand find the observed spectral lags would increase. A sample including 15\nsingle pulses whose spectral evolution follows hard to soft has been\ninvestigated. All the lags of these pulses are positive, which is in good\nagreement with our theoretical predictions. Our analysis shows that only the\nintrinsic spectral evolution can produce the spectral lags and the observed\nlags should be contributed by the intrinsic spectral evolution and the\ncurvature effect. But it is still unclear what cause the spectral evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 01:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The MOPI scheme uses channel sounding\nand physical-layer network coding (PNC) to prevent eavesdroppers from learning\nthe channel state information (CSI). Nevertheless, due to the use of multiple\nantennas for PNC at transmitter and beamforming at receiver, it is not possible\nto have spatial multiplexing nor use space-time codes in our previous MOPI\nscheme. In this paper, we propose a variant of the MOPI scheme, called P-MOPI,\nthat works with a cryptographic cipher and utilizes precoding matrix index\n(PMI) as an efficient key-exchange mechanism.

A simple scheme to obtain\ncircular polarization control with crossed undulators has been proposed so far.\nIn its simplest configuration the crossed undulators consist of pair of short\nplanar undulators in crossed position separated by an electromagnetic phase\nshifter. An advantage of this configuration is a fast helicity switching. A\ndrawback is that a high degree of circular polarization (over 90%) can only be\nachieved for lengths of the insertion devices significantly shorter than the\ngain length, i.e. at output power significantly lower than the saturation power\nlevel. The obvious and technically possible extension considered in this paper,\nis to use a setup with two or more crossed undulators separated by phase\nshifters. This cascade crossed undulator scheme is distinguished, in\nperformance, by a fast helicity switching, a high degree of circular\npolarization (over 95%) and a high output power level, comparable with the\nsaturation power level in the baseline undulator at fundamental wavelength.

We consider that individuals tend to move according to a desired, or\nspontanous, velocity.

We develop those principles in the microscopic and\nmacroscopic settings, and we present how the framework of Wasserstein distance\nbetween measures allows to recover the sweeping process nature of the problem\non the macroscopic level, which makes it possible to obtain existence results\nin spite of the non-smooth character of the evolution process.

In\ncontrast, biological systems operate in a highly flexible manner; learn quickly\nadequate responses to novel conditions, and evolve new routines/traits to\nremain competitive under persistent environmental change. A recent theory on\nthe origins of biological flexibility has proposed that degeneracy - the\nexistence of multi-functional components with partially overlapping functions -\nis a primary determinant of the robustness and adaptability found in evolved\nsystems. While degeneracy's contribution to biological flexibility is well\ndocumented, there has been little investigation of degeneracy design principles\nfor achieving flexibility in systems engineering. Actually, the conditions that\ncan lead to degeneracy are routinely eliminated in engineering design.\n  With the planning of transportation vehicle fleets taken as a case study,\nthis paper reports evidence that degeneracy improves robustness and\nadaptability of a simulated fleet without incurring costs to efficiency. We\nfind degeneracy dramatically increases robustness of a fleet to unpredicted\nchanges in the environment while it also facilitates robustness to anticipated\nvariations. When we allow a fleet's architecture to be adapted in response to\nenvironmental change, we find degeneracy can be selectively acquired, leading\nto faster rates of design adaptation and ultimately to better designs. Given\nthe range of conditions where favorable short-term and long-term performance\noutcomes are observed, we propose that degeneracy design principles\nfundamentally alter the propensity for adaptation and may be useful within\nseveral engineering and planning contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 10:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-24"}

This cluster appears\nto be much more relaxed than Coma, but is embedded in a large scale filament of\ngalaxies. Our aim is to compare the properties of fLSBs in these two very\ndifferent clusters, to search for environmental effects. Based on deep\nCFHT/Megacam images in the u*, g', r' and i' bands, we selected galaxies with\nr'>21 and surface brightness > 24 mag/arcsec-2.

In a\ng'-i' versus i' color-magnitude diagram, we find that a large part of these\nfLSBs follow the red sequence (RS) of brighter galaxies. The fLSBs within\n+-1sigma of the RS show a homogeneous spatial distribution, while those above\nthe RS appear to be concentrated along the large scale filament of galaxies.\nThese properties are interpreted as agreeing with the idea that RS fLSBs are\nformed in groups prior to cluster assembly.
