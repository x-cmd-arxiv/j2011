From the H-alpha\nluminosity of the spiral, we obtain an ionized gas mass of the order of one\nmillion solar masses. One possibility is that the nuclear spiral represents a\ngas inflow triggered by a recent accretion event which has replenished the\naccretion disk, giving rise to the double-peaked emission-line profiles\ncharacteristic of Arp102B. However, the radio images show a one-sided curved\njet which correlates with the eastern spiral arm observed in the H-alpha image.\nA published milliarcsecond radio image also shows one-sided structure at\nposition angle about 40 degrees, approximately aligned with the inner part of\nthe eastern spiral arm. The absence of a radio counter-part to the western\nspiral arm is tentatively interpreted as indicating that the jet is\nrelativistic, with an estimated speed of 0.45c. Estimates of the jet kinetic\nenergy and the ionizing luminosity of the active nucleus indicate that both are\ncapable of ionizing the gas along the spiral arms.

Therefore, we propose a new measure,\nwhich extends the AUC index for identifying variables with good potential to be\nused in a diagnostic scheme. In addition, we propose a threshold gradient\ndescent based algorithm for finding the best linear combination of variables\nthat maximizes this new measure, which is applicable even when the number of\nvariables is huge.

This optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emerging\nafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to X-ray\nlight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireball\nmodel. The intrinsic extinction toward GRB 080603A is high (A_V,z = 0.8 mag),\nand the well-sampled X-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution is\ninteresting in requiring an LMC2 extinction profile, in contrast to the\nmajority of GRBs. Comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected optical\nflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-Compton origin for the prompt\ngamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from the\ninhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. In this scenario, a large velocity\nirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milder\ninternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. Flat\ngamma-ray spectra, roughly F propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many GRBs. If the\nflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in GRB 080603A, the optical\nflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. If\nthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding the\nnature of the emission process in the prompt phase of GRBs and highlights the\nimportance of deep (R> 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable of\ndetecting faint, prompt optical emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2011 07:33:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 12:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

V5558 Sgr shows a pre-maximum halt and then several\nflare-like rebrightenings, which is similar to another very slow nova V723 Cas.\nIn our observations, the spectral type of V5558 Sgr evolved from the He/N type\ntoward the Fe II type during the pre-maximum halt, and then toward the He/N\ntype again. This course of spectral transition was observed for the first time\nin the long history of the nova research. In the rebrightening stage after the\ninitial brightness maximum, we could identify many emission lines accompanied\nby a stronger absorption component of the P-Cygni profile at the brightness\nmaxima.

This problem has been devoted a lot of attention in the last decade but\nthere are still some open issues. First, the control flow graph (CFG) of a\nbinary program is needed to compute the WCET and this CFG is built using some\ninternal knowledge of the compiler that generated the binary code; moreover\nonce constructed the CFG has to be manually annotated with loop bounds. Second,\nthe algorithms to compute the WCET (combining Abstract Interpretation and\nInteger Linear Programming) are tailored for specific architectures: changing\nthe architecture (e.g. replacing an ARM7 by an ARM9) requires the design of a\nnew ad hoc algorithm. Third, the tightness of the computed results (obtained\nusing the available tools) are not compared to actual execution times measured\non the real hardware. In this paper we address the above mentioned problems. We\nfirst describe a fully automatic method to compute a CFG based solely on the\nbinary program to analyse. Second, we describe the model of the hardware as a\nproduct of timed automata, and this model is independent from the program\ndescription. The model of a program running on a hardware is obtained by\nsynchronizing (the automaton of) the program with the (timed automata) model of\nthe hardware. Computing the WCET is reduced to a reachability problem on the\nsynchronised model and solved using the model-checker UPPAAL.

The results show that the nature of adhesion between\ngraphene and its substrate is qualitatively dependent on the surface defect\ntype. In particular, the interaction between graphene and silicon-terminated\nSiO$_2$ originates exclusively from the vdW interaction, whereas the\noxygen-terminated surface provides additional ionic contribution to the binding\narising from interfacial charge transfer ($p$-type doping of graphene). Strong\ndoping contrast for the different surface terminations provides a mechanism for\nthe charge inhomogeneity of graphene on amorphous SiO$_2$ observed in\nexperiments.

It is further assumed\nthe presence of a (public) rate-limited link between Alice and Bob. In this\nsetting, Eve perfectly observes the information bits sent by Alice to Bob and\nhas also access to a correlated source which can be used as side information. A\nsecond encoder (referred to as Charlie) helps Bob in estimating Alice's source\nby sending a compressed version of its own correlated observation via a\n(private) rate-limited link, which is only observed by Bob. For instance, the\nproblem at hands can be seen as the unification between the Berger-Tung and the\nsecure source coding setups.

There are 26\nmatches between the catalog of spectroscopic binary orbits (SB9) and the whole\nRAVE sample for which the given periastron time and the time of RAVE\nobservation were close enough to yield a reliable comparison. RAVE measurements\nof radial velocities of known spectroscopic binaries are consistent with their\npublished radial velocity curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2011 14:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We also prove that\nthose pseudo-Anosov maps $f$ on $S_n$ with the minimum dilatations can never\ndefine a trivial mapping class as any puncture $x_i$ of $S_n$ is filled in. The\nmain tool is to give both lower and upper bounds estimations for dilatations\n$\\lambda(f)$ of those pseudo-Anosov maps $f$ on $S_n$ isotopic to the identity\nas a puncture $x_i$ of $S_n$ is filled in.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2011 15:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-10"}

In this paper we study the natural\nself-maps defined the following way: $F$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree\n$d$ in $(N+1)$ variables $X_i$ defining a smooth hypersurface. Suppose the\ncharacteristic of the field does not divide $d$ and define the map of partial\nderivatives $\\phi_F = (F_{X_0},...,F_{X_N})$.

The source detection limit varies across the\nsurvey field but the typical 50% completion limit is ~17th mag (Vega System) in\nthe 1.90 micron band. A comparison with the expected stellar magnitude\ndistribution shows that these sources are primarily Main-Sequence massive stars\n(>7M) and evolved lower mass stars at the distance of the GC. In particular,\nthe observed source magnitude distribution exhibits a prominent peak, which\ncould represent the Red Clump stars within the GC.

The flux ratios of our detected sources in the two bands also allow for\nan adaptive and statistical estimate of extinction across the field.
