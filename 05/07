Much of this\nexcitement has centred on the claim that a certain class of quantum dimer\nmodel, defined on a bipartite lattice, can support a quantum U(1)-liquid phase\nwith deconfined fractional excitations in three dimensions. These fractional\nmonomer excitations are quantum analogues of the magnetic monopoles found in\nspin ice. In this article we use extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations to\nestablish the ground-state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on the\nthree-dimensional, bipartite, diamond lattice as a function of the ratio {\\mu}\nof the potential to kinetic energy terms in the Hamiltonian. We find that, for\n{\\mu}_c = 0.75 +/- 0.04, the model undergoes a first-order quantum phase\ntransition from an ordered \"R-state\" into an extended quantum U(1)-liquid\nphase, which terminates in a quantum critical \"RK point\" for {\\mu}=1. This\nconfirms the published field-theoretical scenario. We present detailed evidence\nfor the existence of the U(1)-liquid phase, and indirect evidence for the\nexistence of its photon and monopole excitations. We also explore some of the\ntechnical ramifications of this analysis, benchmarking quantum Monte Carlo\nagainst a variety of exact and perturbative results, comparing different\nvariational wave functions. The ergodicity of the quantum dimer model on a\ndiamond lattice is discussed in detail. These results complete and extend the\nanalysis previously published in [O. Sikora et al., Phys. Rev.

Using these data, which span about 225 days, we studied the\nlong-term spectral and timing characteristics of SGR 1833-0832.

To obtain this result, we use connections between basic\nFourier analysis and spectral graph theory to show that one can reduce testing\nodd-cycle-freeness of Boolean functions to testing bipartiteness of dense\ngraphs. Our work forms part of a recent sequence of works that shows\nconnections between testability of properties of Boolean functions and of graph\nproperties.

It is notable that this implied\nrotation rate is lower than that attributed to the solar radiative zone,\nsuggestive of a slowly rotating solar core. This leads us to hypothesize that\nthere may be an \"inner tachocline\" separating the core from the radiative zone,\nanalogous to the \"outer tachocline\" that separates the radiative zone from the\nconvection zone. The Rieger periodicity (which has a period of about 154 days,\ncorresponding to a frequency of 2.37 year^{-1}) may be attributed to an r-mode\noscillation with spherical-harmonic indices l=3, m=1, located in the outer\ntachocline. This suggests that we may test the hypothesis of a solar influence\non nuclear decay rates by searching BNL and PTB data for evidence of a\n\"Rieger-like\" r-mode oscillation, with l=3, m=1, in the inner tachocline. The\nappropriate search band for such an oscillation is estimated to be 2.00-2.28\nyear^{-1}. We find, in both datasets, strong evidence of a periodicity at 2.11\nyear^{-1}.

The primary subject of this thesis is the theory of entropic\nquantum dynamics (EQD), which seeks to avoid these conceptual problems by\ninterpreting quantum theory from an informational perspective.\n  We begin by reviewing probability theory as a means of rationally quantifying\nuncertainties. We then discuss how probabilities can be updated with the method\nof maximum entropy (ME). We then review some motivating difficulties in quantum\nmechanics before discussing Caticha's work in deriving quantum theory from the\napproach of entropic dynamics.\n  After entropic dynamics is introduced, we develop the concepts of symmetries\nand transformations from an informational perspective. The primary result is\nthe formulation of a symmetry condition that any transformation must satisfy in\norder to qualify as a symmetry in EQD. We then proceed to apply this condition\nto the extended Galilean transformation. This transformation is of interest as\nit exhibits features of both special and general relativity.

Combining our multi-band light curves spanning 40 yr with previous light\ncurve data from the literature, we fit a model light curve that for the first\ntime includes the effects of apsidal motion of the system. We measure an\napsidal period of 33.48+0.10-0.06 yr. As a consequence of incorporating the\napsidal motion into the modeling of the system's orbital parameters, we\ndetermine an updated eccentricity of e = 0.07755+0.00022-0.00027, which differs\nsignificantly from the value previously reported in the literature. Evidently,\nthe inclusion of apsidal motion in the light curve modeling significantly\naffects the eccentricity determination. Incorporating these key parameters into\na comprehensive model of the system's physical parameters-including internal\nstructure constraints- will bring V578 Mon to the next level of benchmark\nprecision and utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 21:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 16:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In this paper, we show that this apparent contradiction may be solved\nby simultaneously taking into account both the effect due to the density\nenhancement in the QSO near zones and that due to the obscuration of the tori\nassociated with the QSOs, using a large number of Monte-Carlo generated\nsynthetic Lyman alpha forest spectra. We demonstrate that the QSO properties\nand environment can be constrained simultaneously by the transverse PE and the\nline of sight PE of bright type 1 QSOs together. The current available\nmeasurements on the PEs of type 1 QSOs suggest that (1) the density is\nsignificantly enhanced in the vicinity of the QSOs; (2) the QSO lifetime is\nconsistent with being as large as a few 10^7 yr and a substantially shorter\nlifetime (e.g., <~10^6 yr) is not required; and (3) the half opening angle of\nthe tori associated with QSOs is ~60 deg, consistent with some other\nindependent estimates.

It is a well-known planning problem, which has been studied for a\nlong time. Yet many simple properties remain unknown. This paper studies\nwhether modern SAT solvers are applicable to this puzzle. To our best\nknowledge, we are the first to translate Rubik's Cube to a SAT problem. To\nreduce the number of variables and clauses needed for the encoding, we replace\na naive approach of 6 Boolean variables to represent each color on each facelet\nwith a new approach of 3 or 2 Boolean variables. In order to be able to solve\nquickly Rubik's Cube, we replace the direct encoding of 18 turns with the layer\nencoding of 18-subtype turns based on 6-type turns. To speed up the solving\nfurther, we encode some properties of two-phase algorithm as an additional\nconstraint, and restrict some move sequences by adding some constraint clauses.\nUsing only efficient encoding cannot solve this puzzle. For this reason, we\nimprove the existing SAT solvers, and develop a new SAT solver based on\nPrecoSAT, though it is suited only for Rubik's Cube. The new SAT solver\nreplaces the lookahead solving strategy with an ALO (\\emph{at-least-one})\nsolving strategy, and decomposes the original problem into sub-problems. Each\nsub-problem is solved by PrecoSAT. The empirical results demonstrate both our\nSAT translation and new solving technique are efficient. Without the efficient\nSAT encoding and the new solving technique, Rubik's Cube will not be able to be\nsolved still by any SAT solver. Using the improved SAT solver, we can find\nalways a solution of length 20 in a reasonable time. Although our solver is\nslower than Kociemba's algorithm using lookup tables, but does not require a\nhuge lookup table.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2011 12:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-10"}

We employ the pi- and rho-meson Regge\ntrajectories in the t-channel, in addition to the proton- and Delta-pole, in\nthe s- and u-channels respectively, and the contact-interaction contributions.\nA specific scheme for the form factor which satisfies the Ward-Takahashi\nidentity, crossing symmetry, and on-shell condition, is taken into account. To\ndiscuss the validity of the Regge approach within the Effective Lagrangian\nmethod, we also consider a smooth interpolation between the Regge- and\nFeynman-propagators for the t-channel meson exchanges as a function of sqrt(s).\nWe present the numerical results for the energy and angular dependences of the\ncross sections, and double-polarization observable. It turns out that the\npresent framework shows the significance of the pi-exchange and contact\ninteraction terms to reproduce the experimental data qualitatively well.\nEspecially, the interpolation between the two propagators plays a crucial role\nto reproduce the high-energy experimental data. The pi^+ decay-angle\ndistribution is also studied using the Delta^++ decay frame, i.e. the\nGottfried-Jackson frame. The present results will be a useful guide for future\nhigh-energy photon-beam experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2011 14:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-02"}

Indeed, the ability to manipulate quantum states of\nlight by integrated devices may open new perspectives both for fundamental\ntests of quantum mechanics and for novel technological applications. However,\nthe technology for handling polarization encoded qubits, the most commonly\nadopted approach, is still missing in quantum optical circuits. Here we\ndemonstrate the first integrated photonic Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate for\npolarization encoded qubits.
