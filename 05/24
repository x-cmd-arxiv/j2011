We model the channel as a propagation graph in which vertices represent\ntransmitters, receivers, and scatterers, while edges represent propagation\nconditions between vertices. The recursive structure of the graph accounts for\nthe exponential power decay and the avalanche effect. We derive a closed form\nexpression for the graph's transfer matrix. This expression is valid for any\nnumber of interactions and is straightforward to use in numerical simulations.\nWe discuss an example where time dispersion occurs only due to propagation in\nbetween vertices.

Motivated by this gap, in the\nfirst part of the paper, we present two adaptive steplength schemes for\nstrongly convex differentiable stochastic optimization problems, equipped with\nconvergence theory. The first scheme, referred to as a recursive steplength\nstochastic approximation scheme, optimizes the error bounds to derive a rule\nthat expresses the steplength at a given iteration as a simple function of the\nsteplength at the previous iteration and certain problem parameters. This rule\nis seen to lead to the optimal steplength sequence over a prescribed set of\nchoices. The second scheme, termed as a cascading steplength stochastic\napproximation scheme, maintains the steplength sequence as a piecewise-constant\ndecreasing function with the reduction in the steplength occurring when a\nsuitable error threshold is met. In the second part of the paper, we allow for\nnondifferentiable objective and we propose a local smoothing technique that\nleads to a differentiable approximation of the function. Assuming a uniform\ndistribution on the local randomness, we establish a Lipschitzian property for\nthe gradient of the approximation and prove that the obtained Lipschitz bound\ngrows at a modest rate with problem size. This facilitates the development of\nan adaptive steplength stochastic approximation framework, which now requires\nsampling in the product space of the original measure and the artificially\nintroduced distribution. The resulting adaptive steplength schemes are applied\nto three stochastic optimization problems. We observe that both schemes perform\nwell in practice and display markedly less reliance on user-defined parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 16:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Using Wade-Mingos rule well known for describing the stability of\ncloso-boranes (BnHn2-) and state of the art theoretical method we show that a\nnew class of super and hyperhalogens, guided by this rule, can be formed by\ntailoring the size and composition of borane derivatives. Unlike conventional\nsuperhalogens which have a metal atom at the core surrounded by halogen atoms,\nthe superhalogens formed using the Wade-Mingos rule do not have to have either\nhalogen or metal atoms. We demonstrate this by using B12H13 and its\nisoelectronic cluster, CB11H12 as examples. We also show that while\nconventional superhalogens containing alkali atoms require at least two halogen\natoms, only one borane-like moiety is sufficient to render M(B12H12) (M=Li, Na,\nK, Rb, Cs) clusters superhalogen properties. In addition, hyperhalogens can be\nformed by using the above superhalogens as building blocks. Examples include\nM(B12H13)2 and M(C-B11H12)2 (M=Li - Cs).

In this paper we develop a general\nframework that allows us to derive a number of new results, in particular when\n$f$ may be a non-monotone function. Our algorithms are based on (approximately)\nmaximizing the multilinear extension $F$ of $f$ over a polytope $P$ that\nrepresents the constraints, and then effectively rounding the fractional\nsolution. Although this approach has been used quite successfully, it has been\nlimited in some important ways. We overcome these limitations as follows.\n  First, we give constant factor approximation algorithms to maximize $F$ over\na down-closed polytope $P$ described by an efficient separation oracle.\nPreviously this was known only for monotone functions. For non-monotone\nfunctions, a constant factor was known only when the polytope was either the\nintersection of a fixed number of knapsack constraints or a matroid polytope.\nSecond, we show that contention resolution schemes are an effective way to\nround a fractional solution, even when $f$ is non-monotone. In particular,\ncontention resolution schemes for different polytopes can be combined to handle\nthe intersection of different constraints. Via LP duality we show that a\ncontention resolution scheme for a constraint is related to the correlation gap\nof weighted rank functions of the constraint. This leads to an optimal\ncontention resolution scheme for the matroid polytope.\n  Our results provide a broadly applicable framework for maximizing linear and\nsubmodular functions subject to independence constraints. We give several\nillustrative examples.

This enables us to measure CO intensities with high\nsignificance as low as Ico = 0.3 K km/s (H2_SD = 1 Msun/pc2), an improvement of\nabout one order of magnitude over previous studies. We detect CO out to radii\nRgal = R25 and find the CO radial profile to follow a uniform exponential\ndecline with scale length of 0.2 R25. Comparing our sensitive CO profiles to\nmatched profiles of HI, Halpha, FUV, and IR emission at 24um and 70um, we\nobserve a tight, roughly linear relation between CO and IR intensity that does\nnot show any notable break between regions that are dominated by molecular (H2)\ngas (H2_SD > HI_SD) and those dominated by atomic gas (H2_SD < HI_SD).

These galaxy-to-galaxy\nvariations dominate the scatter in relations between CO and SFR tracers\nmeasured at large scales. The variations have the sense that less massive\ngalaxies exhibit larger ratios of SFR-to-CO than massive galaxies.

We used the\nChandra ACIS-I instrument to search for diffuse X-ray emission around an ideal\ncandidate galaxy: the isolated giant spiral NGC 1961. We observed four\nquadrants around the galaxy for 30 ks each, carefully subtracting background\nand point source emission, and found diffuse emission that appears to extend to\n40-50 kpc. We fit $\\beta$-models to the emission, and estimate a hot halo mass\nwithin 50 kpc of $5\\times10^9 M_{\\odot}$. When this profile is extrapolated to\n500 kpc (the approximate virial radius), the implied hot halo mass is\n$1-3\\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. These mass estimates assume a gas metallicity of\n$Z = 0.5 Z_{\\odot}$. This galaxy's hot halo is a large reservoir of gas, but\nfalls significantly below observational upper limits set by pervious searches,\nand suggests that NGC 1961 is missing 75% of its baryons relative to the cosmic\nmean, which would tentatively place it below an extrapolation of the baryon\nTully-Fisher relationship of less massive galaxies. The cooling rate of the gas\nis no more than 0.4 $M_{\\odot}$/year, more than an order of magnitude below the\ngas consumption rate through star formation.

We find that halo clouds do not develop from linear isobaric\nperturbations. This is a regime where the cooling time is longer than the\nBrunt-Vaisala time, confirming previous linear analysis. We extend the analysis\ninto the nonlinear regime by considering mildly or strongly nonlinear\nperturbations with overdensities up to 100, also varying the initial height,\nthe cloud size, and the metallicity of the gas. Here, the result depends on the\nratio of cooling time to the time required to accelerate the cloud to the sound\nspeed (similar to the dynamical time). If the ratio exceeds a critical value\nnear unity, the cloud is accelerated without further cooling and gets disrupted\nby Kelvin-Helmholtz and/or Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. If it is less than\nthe critical value, the cloud cools and condenses before disruption. Accreting\ngas with overdensities of 10-20 is expected to be marginally unstable; the\ncooling fraction will depend on the metallicity, the size of the incoming\ncloud, and the distance to the galaxy.

Quantum mechanics provides us with a new resource, called quantum\nentanglement, which can be exploited to achieve novel tasks such as\nteleportation and superdense coding. Current technologies allow the\ntransmission of entangled photon pairs across distances up to roughly 100\nkilometers. For longer distances, noise arising from various sources degrade\nthe transmission of entanglement to the point that it becomes impossible to use\nthe entanglement as a resource for future tasks. A strategy for dealing with\nthis difficulty is to employ quantum repeaters, stations intermediate between\nthe sender and receiver which participate in the process of entanglement\ndistillation, thereby improving on what the sender and receiver could do on\ntheir own. In this work, we study entanglement distillation between two\nrecipients sharing a mixed state and with the help of repeater stations. We\nextend the notion of entanglement of assistance to arbitrary states and give a\nprotocol for extracting pure entanglement. We also study quantum communication\nprotocols in a more general context. We give a new protocol for the task of\nmultiparty state merging. The previous multiparty state merging protocol\nrequired the use of time-sharing. Our protocol does not require time-sharing\nfor distributed compression of two senders. In the one-shot regime, we achieve\nmultiparty state merging with entanglement costs not restricted to corner\npoints of the entanglement cost region. Our analysis of the entanglement cost\nis performed using (smooth) min- and max-entropies. We illustrate the benefits\nof our approach by looking at different examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 23:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-25"}

This offers a fascinating arena to\nstudy the physics of broken gauge symmetry. However, the important symmetries\nin superconductors are not only the gauge invariance. Especially, the symmetry\nproperties of the pairing, i.e., the parity and spin-singlet/spin-triplet,\ndetermine the physical properties of the superconducting state. Recently it has\nbeen recognized that there is the important third symmetry of the pair\namplitude, i.e., even or odd parity with respect to the frequency. The\nconventional uniform superconducting states correspond to the even-frequency\npairing, but the recent finding is that the odd-frequency pair amplitude arises\nin the spatially non-uniform situation quite ubiquitously. Especially, this is\nthe case in the Andreev bound state (ABS) appearing at the surface/interface of\nthe sample. The other important recent development is on the nontrivial\ntopological aspects of superconductors. As the band insulators are classified\nby topological indices into (i) conventional insulator, (ii) quantum Hall\ninsulator, and (iii) topological insulator, also are the gapped\nsuperconductors. The influence of the nontrivial topology of the bulk states\nappears as the edge or surface of the sample. In the superconductors, this\nleads to the formation of zero energy ABS (ZEABS). Therefore, the ABSs of the\nsuperconductors are the place where the symmetry and topology meet each other\nwhich offer the stage of rich physics.

While initially a\ncuriosity, it was quickly realized that these vacuum fluctuations had\nmeasurable consequences, for instance producing the Lamb shift of atomic\nspectra and modifying the magnetic moment for the electron. This type of\nrenormalization due to vacuum fluctuations is now central to our understanding\nof nature. However, these effects provide indirect evidence for the existence\nof vacuum fluctuations. From early on, it was discussed if it might instead be\npossible to more directly observe the virtual particles that compose the\nquantum vacuum. 40 years ago, Moore suggested that a mirror undergoing\nrelativistic motion could convert virtual photons into directly observable real\nphotons. This effect was later named the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE). Using\na superconducting circuit, we have observed the DCE for the first time. The\ncircuit consists of a coplanar transmission line with an electrical length that\ncan be changed at a few percent of the speed of light. The length is changed by\nmodulating the inductance of a superconducting quantum interference device\n(SQUID) at high frequencies (~11 GHz). In addition to observing the creation of\nreal photons, we observe two-mode squeezing of the emitted radiation, which is\na signature of the quantum character of the generation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 09:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-20"}

For instance, we express the spin-$s$ XXZ\ncorrelation function of an arbitrary entry at zero temperature in terms of a\nsum of multiple integrals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 10:11:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 11:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

But what are the modes of sequence evolution leading to\nrapid formation and loss of regulatory sites? Here, we show that a large\nfraction of neighboring transcription factor binding sites in the fly genome\nhave formed from a common sequence origin by local duplications. This mode of\nevolution is found to produce regulatory information: duplications can seed new\nsites in the neighborhood of existing sites. Duplicate seeds evolve\nsubsequently by point mutations, often towards binding a different factor than\ntheir ancestral neighbor sites. These results are based on a statistical\nanalysis of 346 cis-regulatory modules in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,\nand a comparison set of intergenic regulatory sequence in Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae. In fly regulatory modules, pairs of binding sites show\nsignificantly enhanced sequence similarity up to distances of about 50 bp.

The model assumes that the instantaneous SFR\nis given by the mass above a certain density threshold divided by its free-fall\ntime. The instantaneous number of massive stars is computed assuming a Kroupa\nIMF. These stars feed back on the cloud through ionizing radiation, eroding it.\nThe main controlling parameter of the evolution turns out to be the maximum\ncloud mass, $\\Mmax$. This allows us to compare various properties of the model\nclouds against their observational counterparts. A giant molecular cloud (GMC)\nmodel ($\\Mmax \\sim 10^5 \\Msun$) adheres very well to the evolutionary scenario\nrecently inferred by Kawamura et al. (2009) for GMCs in the Large Magellanic\nCloud. A model cloud with $\\Mmax \\approx 2000 \\Msun$ evolves in the\nKennicutt-Schmidt diagram first passing through the locus of typical low-\nto-intermediate mass star-forming clouds, and then moving towards the locus of\nhigh-mass star-forming ones over the course of $\\sim 10$ Myr. Also, the stellar\nage histograms for this cloud a few Myr before its destruction agree very well\nwith those observed in the $\\rho$-Oph stellar association, whose parent cloud\nhas a similar mass, and imply that the SFR of the clouds increases with time.\nOur model thus agrees well with various observed properties of star-forming\nMCs, suggesting that the scenario of gravitationally collapsing MCs, with their\nSFR regulated by stellar feedback, is entirely feasible and in agreement with\nkey observed properties of molecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 14:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 02:46:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 19:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

After\nthe baseline undulator, the electron beam is transported through a drift by a\nFODO focusing system, and through a short helical radiator. The microbunching\nstructure can be preserved, and intense coherent radiation is emitted in the\nhelical undulator at fundamental harmonic. The driving idea of this proposal is\nthat the background linearly-polarized radiation from the baseline undulator is\nsuppressed by spatial filtering. Filtering is achieved by letting radiation and\nelectron beam through Be slits upstream of the helical radiator, where the\nradiation spot size is about ten times larger than the electron beam transverse\nsize. Several changes considered in the present paper were made to improve the\nprevious design. Slits are now placed immediately behind the helical radiator.\nThe advantage is that the electron beam can be spoiled by the slits, and\nnarrower slits width can be used for spatial filtering. Due to this fundamental\nreason, the present setup is shorter than the previous one. The helical\nradiator is now placed immediately behind the SHAB undulator. It is thus\nsufficient to use the existing FODO focusing system of the SHAB undulator for\ntransporting the modulated electron beam.

A structural order parameter inside the material will yield a\ncontribution to stick-slip friction that is nonmonotonic as temperature crosses\nthe phase transition, peaking at the critical Tc where critical fluctuations\nare strongest, and the sliding-induced order parameter local flips from one\nvalue to another more numerous. Accordingly, the friction below Tc is larger\nwhen the order parameter orientation is such that flips are more effectively\ntriggered by the slider. The observability of these effects and their use for\nfriction control are discussed, for future application to sliding on the\nsurface of and ferro- or antiferro-distortive materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 15:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
