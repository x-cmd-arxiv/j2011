First, a\nlogic (system of reasoning) is employed which is compatible with the\nHilbert-space structure of quantum mechanics as understood by von Neumann:\nquantum properties and their negations correspond to subspaces and their\northogonal complements. It employs a special (single framework) syntactical\nrule to construct meaningful quantum expressions, quite different from the\nquantum logic of Birkhoff and von Neumann. Second, quantum time development is\ntreated as an inherently stochastic process under all circumstances, not just\nwhen measurements take place. The time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation\nprovides probabilities, not a deterministic time development of the world. The\nresulting interpretive framework has no measurement problem and can be used to\nanalyze in quantum terms what is going on before, after, and during physical\npreparation and measurement processes. In particular, appropriate measurements\ncan reveal quantum properties possessed by the measured system before the\nmeasurement took place. There are no mysterious superluminal influences:\nquantum systems satisfy an appropriate form of Einstein locality. This ontology\nprovides a satisfactory foundation for quantum information theory, since it\nsupplies definite answers as to what the information is about. The formalism of\nclassical (Shannon) information theory applies without change in suitable\nquantum contexts, and this suggests the way in which quantum information theory\nextends beyond its classical counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 17:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 17:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-13"}

For a qualitative\nestimate, we model the body with a homogeneous sphere and express the tidal\nphase lag through the lag in a sample of material. Although simplistic, our\nmodel is sufficient to understand that the lags are not identical. The\ndifference emerges because self-gravitation pulls the tidal bulge down. At low\nfrequencies, this reduces strain and makes tidal damping less efficient in\nlarger bodies. At high frequencies, competition between self-gravitation and\nrheology becomes more complex, though for sufficiently large superearths the\nsame rule works: the larger the body, the weaker tidal damping in it. Being\nnegligible for small terrestrial planets and moons, the difference between the\nseismic and tidal lagging (and likewise between the seismic and tidal damping)\nbecomes very considerable for superearths. In those, it is much lower than what\none might expect from using a seismic quality factor. The tidal damping rate\ndeviates from the seismic damping rate especially in the zero-frequency limit,\nand this difference takes place for bodies of any size. So the equal in\nmagnitude but opposite in sign tidal torques, exerted on one another by the\nprimary and the secondary, go smoothly through zero as the secondary crosses\nthe synchronous orbit. We describe the mantle rheology with the Andrade model,\nallowing it to lean towards the Maxwell model at the lowest frequencies. To\nimplement this additional flexibility, we reformulate the Andrade model by\nendowing it with a free parameter which is the ratio of the anelastic timescale\nto the viscoelastic Maxwell time of the mantle. Some uncertainty in this\nparameter's frequency-dependence does not influence our principal conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 17:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 23:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 03:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 03:02:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2011 00:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 01:27:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 22:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2011 19:06:36 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 17:34:48 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 16:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2011 00:28:20 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 23:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-03"}

Our motivation is to improve the understanding of open\nstring theory at finite \\alpha' as a model of gauge theories.

It can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary redshift\nranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, and\nnaturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelength\nphotometry. We build models of quasars in flux-redshift space by applying the\nextreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. By\nintegrating this density over redshift one can obtain quasar flux-densities in\ndifferent redshift ranges. This approach allows for efficient, consistent, and\nfast classification and photometric redshift estimation.

However, since the measurements are also consistent with astrophysical\ninterpretations, the message is unclear. In this paper, we point out that dark\nmatter can have a more distinct signal in cosmic rays, that of a charge\nasymmetry. Such charge asymmetry can result if the dark matter's abundance is\ndue to a relic asymmetry, allowing its decay to generate an asymmetry in\npositrons and electrons. This is analogous to the baryon asymmetry, where\ndecaying neutrons produce electrons and not positrons. We explore benchmark\nscenarios where the dark matter decays into a leptophilic charged Higgs boson\nor electroweak gauge bosons. These models have observable signals in gamma rays\nand neutrinos, which can be tested by Fermi and IceCube. The most powerful test\nwill be at AMS-02, given its ability to distinguish electron and positron\ncharge above 100 GeV. Specifically, an asymmetry favoring positrons typically\npredicts a larger positron ratio and a harder (softer) high energy spectrum for\npositrons (electrons) than charge symmetric sources. We end with a brief\ndiscussion on how such scenarios differ from the leading astrophysical\nexplanations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 21:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-05"}

We calculate the critical size\nspectrum of energy-density fluctuations that allows deconfinement as well as\nthe nucleation rate of each critical bubble. We find that drops with any radii\nsmaller than 800 fm can be formed at a huge rate when matter achieves the bulk\ntransition limit of 5-6 times the nuclear saturation density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 21:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-24"}

In particular TV-based reconstruction is very well suited for\nimages with piecewise nearly constant regions. Computationally, however,\nTV-based reconstruction is much more demanding, especially for 3D imaging, and\nthe reconstruction from clinical data sets is far from being close to\nreal-time. This is undesirable from a clinical perspective, and thus there is\nan incentive to accelerate the solution of the underlying optimization problem.\nThe TV reconstruction can in principle be found by any optimization method, but\nin practice the large-scale systems arising in CT image reconstruction preclude\nthe use of memory-demanding methods such as Newton's method. The simple\ngradient method has much lower memory requirements, but exhibits slow\nconvergence. In the present work we consider the use of two accelerated\ngradient-based methods, GPBB and UPN, for reducing the number of gradient\nmethod iterations needed to achieve a high-accuracy TV solution in CT image\nreconstruction. The former incorporates several heuristics from the\noptimization literature such as Barzilai-Borwein (BB) step size selection and\nnonmonotone line search. The latter uses a cleverly chosen sequence of\nauxiliary points to achieve a better convergence rate.

Massive planets will likely be formed as a\nconsequence of rapid migration of planetesimals and low mass cores into\nspecific trapping sites in protoplanetary discs. We present analytical modeling\nof inhomogeneities in protoplanetary discs around a variety of young stars, -\nfrom Herbig Ae/Be to classical T Tauri and down to M stars, - and show how they\ngive rise to planet traps. The positions of these traps define the initial\norbital distribution of multiple protoplanets.

We\ndemonstrate that up to three traps (heat transitions, ice lines and dead zones)\ncan exist in a single disc, and that they move differently as the disc\naccretion rate $\\dot{M}$ decreases with time. The interaction between the giant\nplanets which grow in such traps may be a crucial ingredient for establishing\nplanetary systems. We also demonstrate that the position of planet traps\nstrongly depends on stellar masses and disc accretion rates.

Our basic assumption is\nthat the antiferromagnetic (AF) state in the parent compounds can be described\nby the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, and that the electrons in these orbitals\nhave relatively strong electron correlation in the vicinity of the AF state. In\norder to study the physical origin of the structure-sensitive SC transition\ntemperature, the effect of orthorhombic distortion is taken into account as the\nenergy-splitting, $\\Delta_{\\textrm{ortho.}}$, between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$\norbitals. We find that the eigenvalue of the linearized gap equation decreases\naccompanied with the reduction of the partial density of states for the\n$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals as $\\Delta_{\\textrm{ortho.}}$ increases, and\nthat the dominant pairing symmetry is an unconventional fully gapped\n$s_{+-}$-wave pairing. We also find large anisotropy of the SC gap function in\nthe orthorhombic phase. We propose that the CEF energy plays an important role\nin controlling $T_{\\textrm{c}}$ and the SC gap function, and that\norbital-selective superconductivity is a key feature in iron-based\nsuperconductors, which causes the structure-sensitive $T_{\\textrm{c}}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 07:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We begin by\nintroducing the notion of criticality of the ASM for limits of finite graphs in\nlocal convergence, which naturally leads to the question about criticality of\nthe ASM in the random weak limit. Our main technical ingredient is a sufficient\ncondition for almost sure criticality of the ASM on sequences of finite cacti\n(i.e., separable graphs whose blocks are cycles or single edges) under the\nassumption that the random weak limit is almost surely 1-ended. Examples that\nallow explicit computations of the critical exponents come from actions of\nfinitely generated groups on regular rooted trees, by automorphisms.\nRestricting the action to the consecutive levels of the tree defines a sequence\nof finite graphs whose limits in the local convergence are orbital Schreier\ngraphs for the action of the group on the boundary of the tree. In the case of\niterated monodromy groups of complex polynomials, these graphs are cacti, and\nwe show that for 1-ended ones, the critical exponent for the decay of the mass\nof avalanches depends on the growth of the graph. The well-known Basilica group\nrelated to $z^2-1$ gives rise to uncountably many 4-regular one-ended graphs of\nquadratic growth with the critical exponent for the mass of avalanches equal to\n1; as well as uncountably many new non-critical examples of quadratic growth\n(thus not quasi-isometric to $\\mathbb{Z}$).

We obtain a lower bound on the output\nstate fidelity valid for any pure input state. We define number-diagonal signal\n(NDS) states to be input states whose density operator in the signal modes is\ndiagonal in the multimode number basis. For such input states, we derive series\nformulas for the optimal error probability, the output state fidelity, and the\nChernoff-type upper bounds on the error probability. For the special cases of\nquantum reading of a classical digital memory and target detection (for which\nthe reflectivities are real valued), we show that for a given input signal\nphoton probability distribution, the fidelity is minimized by the NDS states\nwith that distribution and that for a given average total signal energy N_s,\nthe fidelity is minimized by any multimode Fock state with N_s total signal\nphotons. For reading of an ideal memory, it is shown that Fock state inputs\nminimize the Chernoff bound.

We, in particular, use them to identify and delineate\nbiological tissues found in histology images obtained via digital microscopy.\nIn this paper, we introduce a mathematical formalism that rigorously justifies\nthe use of local histograms for such purposes. We begin by discussing how local\nhistograms can be computed as systems of convolutions. We then introduce\nprobabilistic image models that can emulate textures one routinely encounters\nin histology images.

We further provide several\nmethods for creating models that meet these conditions; the textures generated\nby some of these models resemble those found in histology images. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that histology textures can be analyzed by\ndecomposing their local histograms into more basic components.

We have obtained a lower bound on the magnetic field strength\nand showed this value to be higher than the upper limit following from an\nestimate of the magnetic dipole losses for the magnetars being analyzed in a\nwide range of magnetar model parameters. Thus, it is problematic to explain the\nobserved energy release at the long tail stage of an SGR giant flare in terms\nof the magnetar model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 13:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Although X-ray emission\nseems to originate from shocks internal to jets, the mechanism forming these\nshocks remains controversial. One of the best studied X-ray jet is HH 154 that\nhas been observed by Chandra over a time base of about 10 years. We analyze the\nChandra observations of HH 154 by investigating the evolution of its X-ray\nsource. We show that the X-ray emission consists of a bright stationary\ncomponent and a faint elongated component. We interpret the observations by\ndeveloping a hydrodynamic model describing a protostellar jet originating from\na nozzle and compare the X-ray emission synthesized from the model with the\nX-ray observations. The model takes into account the thermal conduction and\nradiative losses and shows that the jet/nozzle leads to the formation of a\ndiamond shock at the nozzle exit. The shock is stationary over the period\ncovered by our simulations and generates an X-ray source with luminosity and\nspectral characteristics in excellent agreement with the observations. We\nconclude that the X-ray emission from HH 154 is consistent with a diamond shock\noriginating from a nozzle through which the jet is launched into the ambient\nmedium. We suggest that the physical origin of the nozzle could be related to\nthe dense gas in which the HH 154 driving source is embedded and/or to the\nmagnetic field at the jet launching/collimation region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 13:23:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 13:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

An analysis of the\ntwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by the\ndata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 Mpc and r_0~6.7 Mpc,\nrespectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo masses\nM>~10^{12.4} M_sun. Objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,\nwith r_0~19 Mpc and r_0~17 Mpc in the two considered PACS channels. This\ndramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connected\nwith the presence of a wide, M>~10^{14} M_sun, filamentary structure which\nincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2.

We find that the peak of the probability distribution function of\nthe most massive halo is well suited to test the validity of the fiducial LCDM\nmodel, once we are able to establish a sufficiently complete large-area survey\nwith M_lim=10^14.5 M_sun/h (M_lim=10^14 M_sun/h) at redshifts above z=1\n(z=1.5). Being of cumulative nature the proposed measure is robust and an\naccuracy of 20-30% in the cluster masses would be sufficient to test for\nalternative models. Since one only needs the most massive system in each\nangular patch, this method would be ideally suited as a first fast consistency\ncheck before going into a more complex statistical analysis of the observed\nhalo sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 14:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 11:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-14"}

We know of around 180 high\nvelocity impact craters on the Earth with ages up to 2400Myr and diameters up\nto 300km. Some studies have identified a periodicity in their age distribution,\nwith periods ranging from 13 to 50Myr. It has further been claimed that such\nperiods may be causally linked to a periodic motion of the solar system through\nthe Galactic plane. However, many of these studies suffer from methodological\nproblems, for example misinterpretation of p-values, overestimation of\nsignificance in the periodogram or a failure to consider plausible alternative\nmodels. Here I develop a Bayesian method for this problem in which impacts are\ntreated as a stochastic phenomenon. Models for the time variation of the impact\nprobability are defined and the evidence for them in the geological record is\ncompared using Bayes factors. This probabilistic approach obviates the need for\nad hoc statistics, and also makes explicit use of the age uncertainties. I find\nstrong evidence for a monotonic decrease in the recorded impact rate going back\nin time over the past 250Myr for craters larger than 5km. The same is found for\nthe past 150Myr when craters with upper age limits are included. This is\nconsistent with a crater preservation/discovery bias modulating an otherwise\nconstant impact rate. The set of craters larger than 35km (so less affected by\nerosion and infilling) and younger than 400Myr are best explained by a constant\nimpact probability model. A periodic variation in the cratering rate is\nstrongly disfavoured in all data sets. There is also no evidence for a\nperiodicity superimposed on a constant rate or trend, although this more\ncomplex signal would be harder to distinguish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 14:13:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 13:26:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 11:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The selected plan is then made VMAT\ndeliverable by a fluence map merging and sequencing algorithm, which combines\nneighboring fluence maps based on a similarity score and then delivers the\nmerged maps together, simplifying delivery.

Star\nformation histories (SFHs) derived from resolved stars give us the unique\nopportunity to study past star forming events that may have helped shape the\ncurrently visible H I distribution. Our sample of five nearby dwarf irregular\ngalaxies spans over an order of magnitude in both total H I mass and absolute\nB-band magnitude and is at the low mass end of previously studied systems. We\nuse Very Large Array H I line data to estimate the energy required to create\nthe centrally dominant hole in each galaxy. We compare this energy estimate to\nthe past energy released by the underlying stellar populations computed from\nSFHs derived from data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The inferred\nintegrated stellar energy released within the characteristic ages exceeds our\nenergy estimates for creating the holes in all cases, assuming expected\nefficiencies. Therefore, it appears that stellar feedback provides sufficient\nenergy to produce the observed holes. However, we find no obvious signature of\nsingle star forming events responsible for the observed structures when\ncomparing the global SFHs of each galaxy in our sample to each other or to\nthose of dwarf irregular galaxies reported in the literature. We also fail to\nfind evidence of a central star cluster in FUV or Halpha imaging. We conclude\nthat large H I holes are likely formed from multiple generations of star\nformation and only under suitable interstellar medium conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 15:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
