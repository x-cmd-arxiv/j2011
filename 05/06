Our present\nunderstanding of social rules in animal collectives is mainly based on\nempirical fits to observations, with less emphasis in obtaining\nfirst-principles approaches that allow their derivation. Here we show that\npatterns of collective decisions can be derived from the basic ability of\nanimals to make probabilistic estimations in the presence of uncertainty. We\nbuild a decision-making model with two stages: Bayesian estimation and\nprobabilistic matching. In the first stage, each animal makes a Bayesian\nestimation of which behavior is best to perform taking into account personal\ninformation about the environment and social information collected by observing\nthe behaviors of other animals. In the probability matching stage, each animal\nchooses a behavior with a probability equal to the Bayesian-estimated\nprobability that this behavior is the most appropriate one. This model derives\nvery simple rules of interaction in animal collectives that depend only on two\ntypes of reliability parameters, one that each animal assigns to the other\nanimals and another given by the quality of the non-social information. We test\nour model by obtaining theoretically a rich set of observed collective patterns\nof decisions in three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a shoaling\nfish species.

However, lacking a local GRBs\nsample, calibrating the scaling relations proposed as an equivalent to the\nPhillips law to standardize GRBs is not an easy task because of the need to\nestimate the GRBs luminosity distance in a model independent way. We consider\nhere three different calibration methods based on the use of a fiducial\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, on cosmographic parameters and on the local regression on\nSNeIa. We find that the calibration coefficients and the intrinsic scatter do\nnot significantly depend on the adopted calibration procedure. We then\ninvestigate the evolution of these parameters with the redshift finding no\nstatistically motivated improvement in the likelihood so that the no evolution\nassumption is actually a well founded working hypothesis. Under this\nassumption, we then consider possible systematics effects on the HDs introduced\nby the calibration method, the averaging procedure and the homogeneity of the\nsample arguing against any significant bias.

The dominant work over the last\ndecade has focused on massive, luminous starburst galaxies (submm galaxies and\nAGN host galaxies). The far infrared luminosities are ~ 1e13 Lsun, implying\nstar formation rates, SFR > 1e3 Msun/year. Molecular gas reservoirs are found\nwith masses: M(H_2) > 1e10 (alpha/0.8}) Msun.

Density functional studies are performed\nwith the all-electron spin-polarized linear augmented plane wave (LAPW) method.\nThe three $sp^2 \\sigma$ dangling bonds adjacent to the vacancy introduce\nlocalized states (V$\\sigma$) in the mid-gap region, which split due to the\ncrystal field and a Jahn-Teller distortion, while the $p_z \\pi$ states\nintroduce a sharp resonance state (V$\\pi$) in the band structure. For a planar\nstructure, symmetry strictly forbids hybridization between the $\\sigma$ and the\n$\\pi$ states, so that these bands are clearly identifiable in the calculated\nband structure. As for the magnetic moment of the vacancy, the Hund's-rule\ncoupling aligns the spins of the four localized V$\\sigma_1 \\uparrow\n\\downarrow$, V$\\sigma_2 \\uparrow $, and the V$\\pi \\uparrow$ electrons resulting\nin a S=1 state, with a magnetic moment of $2 \\mu_B$, which is reduced by about\n$0.3 \\mu_B$ due to the anti-ferromagnetic spin-polarization of the $\\pi$ band\nitinerant states in the vicinity of the vacancy. This results in the net\nmagnetic moment of $1.7 \\mu_B$. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, we\nreproduce the well-known $\\sim 1/r$ decay of the localized V$\\pi$ wave function\nwith distance and in addition find an interference term coming from the two\nDirac points, previously unnoticed in the literature. The long-range nature of\nthe V$\\pi$ wave function is a unique feature of the graphene vacancy and we\nsuggest that this may be one of the reasons for the widely varying relaxed\nstructures and magnetic moments reported from the supercell band calculations\nin the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 17:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 19:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 20:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2012 19:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

Nevertheless,\nscaling up of these methods and techniques to achieve large scale universal\nQIP, or more specialized quantum simulations remains challenging. The use of\neasily controllable and stable microwave sources instead of complex laser\nsystems on the other hand promises to remove obstacles to scalability.\nImportant remaining drawbacks in this approach are the use of magnetic field\nsensitive states, which shorten coherence times considerably, and the\nrequirement to create large stable magnetic field gradients. Here, we present\ntheoretically a novel approach based on dressing magnetic field sensitive\nstates with microwave fields which addresses both issues and permits fast\nquantum logic. We experimentally demonstrate basic building blocks of this\nscheme to show that these dressed states are long-lived and coherence times are\nincreased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to bare magnetic field\nsensitive states. This changes decisively the prospect of microwave-driven ion\ntrap QIP and offers a new route to extend coherence times for all systems that\nsuffer from magnetic noise such as neutral atoms, NV-centres, quantum dots, or\ncircuit-QED systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 19:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In order to distinguish between these two theories, I present UV\nspectroscopy and find a metallicity consistent with halo origin. Systems close\nto Pmin are expected to have low accretion rates. Some of these CVs show\nabsorption in their spectra, implying that the underlying WD is exposed. This\nyields a rare opportunity to study the WD in a CV. I introduce two new systems\nshowing WD signatures in their light curves and spectra, SDSS J1457+51 and BW\nScl. Despite the fact that CVs close to Pmin should be faint, we find systems\nthat are much too bright for their Porb. Such a system is T Pyx - a recurrent\nnova with an unusually high accretion rate and a photometrically determined\nPorb < 2 hr. T Pyx is about 2 times brighter than any other CV at its period.\nHowever, to confirm its evolutionary status, a more reliable period\ndetermination is needed. Here, I present a spectroscopic study, confirming T\nPyx as a short-period CV. In this thesis, I discuss what implications these\nsystems may have on the current understanding of CV evolution, and the\nimportance of studying individual systems in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 20:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-09"}

The subsequent evolution of Triton's\npost-capture orbit could have proceeded through gravitational tides. The study\nby Agnor & Hamilton (2006) is repeated in the framework of the Nice model to\ndetermine the post-capture orbit of Triton. After capture it is then subjected\nto tidal evolution. The perturbations from the Sun and the figure of Neptune\nare included. The perturbations from the Sun acting on Triton cause it to spend\na long time in its high-eccentricity phase, usually of the order of 10 Myr,\nwhile the typical time to circularise to its current orbit is some 200 Myr. The\ncurrent orbit of Triton is consistent with an origin through binary capture and\ntidal evolution, even though the model prefers Triton to be closer to Neptune\nthan it is today. The probability of capturing Triton in this manner is\napproximately 0.7%. Since the capture of Triton was at most a 50% event --\nsince only Neptune has one, but Uranus does not -- we deduce that in the\nprimordial trans-Neptunian disc there were 100 binaries with at least one\nTriton-sized member. Morbidelli et al. (2009) concludes there were some 1000\nTriton-sized bodies in the trans-Neptunian proto-planetary disc, so the\nprimordial binary fraction with at least one Triton-sized member is 10%. This\nvalue is consistent with theoretical predictions, but at the low end. If Triton\nwas captured at the same time as Neptune's irregular satellites, the far\nmajority of these, including Nereid, would be lost. This suggests either that\nTriton was captured on an orbit with a small semi-major axis a < 50 R_N (a rare\nevent), or that it was captured before the dynamical instability of the Nice\nmodel, or that some other mechanism was at play.

However, little effort has been devoted to the\nformal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms,\ne.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to\nfill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of\nthe solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of\nsamples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing\nexisting algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the\ncost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms\nconverges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the\npaper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are\nprovably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned\nsolution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the\ncomputational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of\nthat of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal)\ncounterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between\nstochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random\ngeometric graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 22:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-09"}

So yes, in a\ncomputational sense, the aTAM is quite powerful! However, if one completely\nremoves this cooperativity condition (a.k.a., temperature 1 self-assembly),\nthen the computational \"power\" of the aTAM (i.e., its ability to support Turing\nuniversal computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \\times N$ squares)\nbecomes unknown.

We first consider the worst case setting and study optimal\nblock computation strategies for computing symmetric Boolean functions. We\nstudy three classes of functions: threshold functions, delta functions and\ninterval functions. We provide exactly optimal strategies for the first two\nclasses, and a scaling law order-optimal strategy with optimal preconstant for\ninterval functions. We also extend the results to the case of integer\nmeasurements and certain integer-valued functions. We use lower bounds from\ncommunication complexity theory, and provide an achievable scheme using\ninformation theoretic tools.\n  Next, we consider the case where nodes measurements are random and drawn from\nindependent Bernoulli distributions. We address the problem of optimal function\ncomputation so as to minimize the expected total number of bits that are\ntransmitted. In the case of computing a single instance of a Boolean threshold\nfunction, we show the surprising result that the optimal order of transmissions\ndepends in an extremely simple way on the values of previously transmitted\nbits, and the ordering of the marginal probabilities of the Boolean variables.\n  The approach presented can be generalized to the case where each node has a\nblock of measurements, though the resulting problem is somewhat harder, and we\nconjecture the optimal strategy. We further show how to generalize to a pulse\nmodel of communication. One can also consider the related problem of\napproximate computation given a fixed number of bits. In this case, the optimal\nstrategy is significantly different, and lacks an elegant characterization.\nHowever, for the special case of the parity function, we show that the greedy\nstrategy is optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 08:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-09"}

We studied\nthree well-observed type II bursts in an attempt to place tighter constraints\non their origins.\n  Methods: The type II bursts were observed by the ARTEMIS radio spectrograph\nand imaged by the Nan\\c{c}ay Radioheliograph (NRH) at least at two frequencies.\nTo take advantage of projection effects, we selected events that occurred away\nfrom disk center.\n  Results: In all events, both flares and CMEs were observed. In the first\nevent, the speed of the shock was about 4200 km/s, while the speed of the CME\nwas about 850 km/s. This discrepancy ruled out the CME as the primary shock\ndriver. The CME may have played a role in the ignition of another shock that\noccurred just after the high speed one. A CME driver was excluded from the\nsecond event as well because the CMEs that appeared in the coronagraph data\nwere not synchronized with the type II burst. In the third event, the\nkinematics of the CME which was determined by combining EUV and white light\ndata was broadly consistent with the kinematics of the type II burst, and,\ntherefore, the shock was probably CME-driven.\n  Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the diversity of conditions that may lead\nto the generation of coronal shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 12:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We\npropose and investigate a wireless switching framework in which a multi-antenna\nrelay is responsible for switching traffic among a set of $N$ stations. We\nrefer to such a relay as a MIMO switch. With beamforming and linear detection,\nthe MIMO switch controls which stations are connected to which other stations.\nEach beamforming matrix realizes a permutation pattern among the stations. We\nrefer to the corresponding permutation matrix as a switch matrix. By scheduling\na set of different switch matrices, full connectivity among the stations can be\nestablished. In this paper, we focus on \"fair switching\" in which equal amounts\nof traffic are to be delivered for all $N(N-1)$ ordered pairs of stations. In\nparticular, we investigate how the system throughput can be maximized. In\ngeneral, for large $N$ the number of possible switch matrices (i.e.,\npermutations) is huge, making the scheduling problem combinatorially\nchallenging. We show that for the cases of N=4 and 5, only a subset of $N-1$\nswitch matrices need to be considered in the scheduling problem to achieve good\nthroughput. We conjecture that this will be the case for large $N$ as well.\nThis conjecture, if valid, implies that for practical purposes, fair-switching\nscheduling is not an intractable problem. We also investigate MIMO switching\nwith physical-layer network coding in this paper. We find that it can improve\nthroughput appreciably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 13:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-09"}

We combine multi-instrument\nco-observations obtained with the SUMER/SoHO and with the EIS/SOT/XRT/Hinode.\nThe analysed three large spicules were found to be comprised of numerous thin\nspicules which rise, rotate and descend simultaneously forming a bush-like\nfeature. Their rotation resembles the untwisting of a large flux rope. They\nshow velocities ranging from 50 to 250 km/s. We clearly associated the red- and\nblue-shifted emissions in transition region lines with rotating but also with\nrising and descending plasmas, respectively. Our main result is that these\nspicules although very large and dynamic, show no presence in spectral lines\nformed at temperatures above 300 000 K. The present paper brings out the\nanalysis of three Ca II H large spicules which are composed of numerous dynamic\nthin spicules but appear as macrospicules in EUV lower resolution images. We\nfound no coronal counterpart of these and smaller spicules. We believe that the\nidentification of phenomena which have very different origins as macrospicules\nis due to the interpretation of the transition region emission, and especially\nthe He II emission, wherein both chromospheric large spicules and coronal X-ray\njets are present. We suggest that the recent observation of spicules in the\ncoronal AIA/SDO 171 A and 211 A channels is probably due to the existence of\ntransition region emission there.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 15:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Short bursts (with durations of less than ~2 s)\nare less frequently observed, technically more difficult to localize, and\nexhibit significantly fainter afterglows. Aims: It is of critical importance to\nestablish whether the burst duration can reliably distinguish the different GRB\npopulation models of collapsars and compact stellar mergers. The Swift GRB\n090426 provides an unique opportunity to address this question. Its duration\n(T_90=1.28 s) places GRB 090426 firmly in the short burst population, while the\nhigh redshift (z=2.609), host galaxy properties, and prompt emission spectral\ncharacteristics are more similar to those of long-duration GRBs. Methods: On\nthe basis of data obtained with the Tautenburg 2m telescope (Germany) and the\n7-channel imager GROND (La Silla, Chile), we compiled the most finely sampled\nlight curve available for a short burst optical/NIR afterglow. The light curve\nwas then analysed in a standard fashion. GROND and XRT data were used to\ndetermine the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the afterglow across\nmore than three orders of magnitude. Results: Our data show that a light curve\nbreak exists at 0.4 days, which is followed by a steep decay. This light curve\ndecay is achromatic in the optical/NIR bands, and interpreted as a post-jet\nbreak phase. The X-ray data do not disagree with this interpretation.\nConclusions: The half-opening angle of the suspected jet as well as the\nluminosity of the optical afterglow provide additional evidence that GRB 090426\nis probably linked to the death of a massive star rather than to the merger of\ntwo compact objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 15:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We numerically study dynamical collapses of\ncharged matter fields in an anti de Sitter background and note the formation of\nblack holes using the double-null formalism. Moreover, we include re-normalized\nenergy-momentum tensors assuming the S-wave approximation to determine\nthermodynamical back-reactions to the internal structures. If there is no\nsemi-classical effects, the amount of charge determines the causal structures.\nIf the charge is sufficiently small, the causal structure has a space-like\nsingularity. However, as the charge increases, an inner Cauchy horizon appears.\nIf we have sufficient charge, we see a space-like outer horizon and a time-like\ninner horizon, and if we give excessive charge, black hole horizons disappear.\nWe have some circumstantial evidences that weak cosmic censorship is still\nsatisfied, even for such excessive charge cases. Also, we confirm that there is\nmass inflation along the inner horizon, although the properties are quite\ndifferent from those of four-dimensional cases. Semi-classical back-reactions\nwill not affect the outer horizon, but they will affect the inner horizon. Near\nthe center, there is a place where negative energy is concentrated. Thus,\ncharged black holes in three dimensions have two types of curvature\nsingularities in general: via mass inflation and via a concentration of\nnegative energy. Finally, we classify possible causal structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 14:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 06:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
