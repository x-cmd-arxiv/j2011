Our target list included a\nsignificant number of very late-type stars, but in fact the majority of the\nsources was without spectral classification.\n  A LO event requires the sampling of the light curve at millisecond rates in\norder to permit a detailed study of the diffraction fringes. For this, we used\nthe so-called burst mode of the ISAAC instrument at the Melipal telescope. Our\nobserving efficiency was ultimately limited by overheads for telescope pointing\nand data storage, to about one event every three minutes.\n  We could record useful light curves for 184 sources.

Additionally we could establish, also for the first time,\nthe resolved nature of at least two more stars, with indication of\ncircumstellar emission.

It can therefore serve as\na tracer of dust processing and disk evolution, which can lead to a better\nunderstanding of the physical processes occurring in the disk, and possibly\nplanet formation. However, the connection of these processes with the overall\ndisk crystallinity remains unclear. We aim to characterize the forsterite\nabundance and spatial distribution in the disk of the Herbig Be star HD 100546,\nto investigate if a connection exists with the large disk gap. We use a 2D\nradiative transfer code, MCMax, to model the circumstellar dust around HD\n100546. We use VISIR Q-band imaging to probe the outer disk geometry and\nmid-infrared features to model the spatial distribution of forsterite. The\ntemperature-dependent shape of the 69 micron feature observed with Herschel\nPACS is used as a critical tool to constrain this distribution. We find a\ncrystalline mass fraction of 40 - 60 %, located close to the disk wall between\n13 and 20 AU, and possibly farther out at the disk surface. The forsterite is\nin thermal contact with the other dust species. We put an upper limit on the\niron content of forsterite of 0.3 %. Optical depth effects play a key role in\nexplaining the observed forsterite features, hiding warm forsterite from view\nat short wavelengths. The disk wall acts as a showcase: it displays a localized\nhigh abundance of forsterite, which gives rise to a high observed\ncrystallinity, while the overall mass fraction of forsterite is a factor of ten\nlower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 16:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Thus R and I are Lorentz-invariant and |v|<=c, with\nequality if and only if R=0. The exceptional fields with |v|=c were called\n\"coherent\" because their energy moves in complete harmony with the field,\nleaving no inertia or reactive energy behind. Generic electromagnetic fields\nbecome coherent only in the far zone. Elsewhere, their energy flows at speeds\n|v|<c. The purpose of this paper is to confirm and clarify this statement by\nstudying the local energy flow in several common systems: a time-harmonic\nelectric dipole field, a time-dependent electric dipole field, and a standing\nplane wave. For these fields, the energy current (Poynting vector) is too weak\nto carry away all of the energy, thus leaving reactive energy in its wake. For\nthe time-dependent dipole field, we find that the energy can flow both\ntransversally and inwards, back to the source. Neither of these phenomena show\nup in the usual computation of the energy transport velocity which considers\nonly averages over one period in the time-harmonic case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 17:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In molecular dynamics simulations, the traditional way\nof constructing work distributions is to perform as many pulling simulations as\npossible. But reliable work distributions are not always produced in a finite\nnumber of simulations. The computational cost of using JE is not less than\nother commonly used methods such as Thermodynamic Integration and Umbrella\nSampling methods. Here we first show a different proof of JE based on the idea\nof step-wise pulling procedures that is efficient in computing free energies by\nusing JE. The key point in our proof is that the processes of turning-on/off a\nharmonic potential to perform work are described by double Heaviside functions\nof time. We then show that the distributions of work performed by the potential\ncan be easily generated from the distributions of a reaction coordinate along a\npathway. Based on the proof, we propose sequential and parallel step-wise\npulling protocols for generating work distributions that require suitable\nrelaxation time at each pulling step. The criterion for reliable work\ndistributions is that there must be sufficient mutual overlaps between the\nadjacent distributions of the reaction coordinate along the pathway. We arrive\nat an alternative formula (besides JE) to compute free energy differences from\nthe averaged values of the reaction coordinate. The combination of JE and the\nalternative formula provides a viable way to determine the accuracy of computed\nfree energy differences.

This work aims to\nexplore ways to make explicit and available the tacit knowledge hidden in the\ncollective intelligence of a collaborative environment within organizations.\nThe environment was defined by folksonomies supported by a faceted semantic\nsearch. Vector space model which incorporates an analogy with the mathematical\napparatus of quantum theory is adopted for the representation and manipulation\nof the meaning of folksonomy. Vector space retrieval has been proven efficiency\nwhen there isn't a data behavioural because it bears ranking algorithms\ninvolving a small number of types of elements and few operations. A solution to\nfind what the user has in mind when posing a query could be based on \"joint\nmeaning\" understood as a joint construal of the creator of the contents and the\nreader of the contents. The joint meaning was proposed to deal with vagueness\non ontology of folksonomy indeterminacy, incompleteness and inconsistencies on\ncollective intelligence. A proof-of concept prototype was built for\ncollaborative environment as evolution of the actual social networks (like\nFacebook, LinkedIn,..) using the information visualization on a RIA application\nwith Semantic Web techniques and technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 19:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-25"}

Archival HST\nACS imaging shows evidence for tidal disruption of the stellar component. This\nV=27 galaxy appears to give us unprecedented insights into two fundamental\nstages in the formation of structure at high redshift: the inflow of gas into\nordinary galaxies, and the escape of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic\nmedium. Neutral hydrogen, falling in partly in form of a narrow filament,\nappears to emit fluorescent Lyman alpha photons induced by the stellar ionizing\nflux escaping from the disturbed galaxy. The in-falling material may represent\nprimary cold accretion or an interaction-triggered inflow. The rate of ionizing\nphotons required by the observed Lyman alpha emission is consistent with the\nrate of photons produced by the observed stellar population, with roughly 50\npercent of ionizing photons escaping from the immediate galaxy and encountering\nthe in-falling gas. The observational properties of the galaxy lend support to\na picture where galaxy interactions facilitate the escape of both Lyman alpha\nand ionizing radiation.

The 33GHz free-free emission is assumed to provide the most accurate\nmeasure of the current SFR. Among the extranuclear star-forming regions, the\n24um, H\\alpha+24um and UV+IR SFR calibrations are in good agreement with the\n33GHz free-free SFRs. However, each of the SFR calibrations relying on some\nform of dust emission overestimate the nuclear SFR by a factor of ~2. This is\nmore likely the result of excess dust heating through an accumulation of\nnon-ionizing stars associated with an extended episode of star formation in the\nnucleus rather than increased competition for ionizing photons by dust. SFR\ncalibrations using the non-thermal radio continuum yield values which only\nagree with the free-free SFRs for the nucleus, and underestimate the SFRs from\nthe extranuclear star-forming regions by a factor of ~2. This result likely\narises from the CR electrons decaying within the starburst region with\nnegligible escape compared to the young extranuclear star-forming regions.\nFinally, we find that the SFRs estimated using the total 33GHz emission agree\nwell with the free-free SFRs due to the large thermal fractions present at\nthese frequencies even when local diffuse backgrounds are not removed. Thus,\nrest-frame 33GHz observations may act as a reliable method to measure the SFRs\nof galaxies at increasingly high redshift without the need of ancillary radio\ndata to account for the non-thermal emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

All lines show\nstrong emission in the \"bullets\" at |v| > 50 km/s from the source velocity, in\naddition to a broad, central component and narrow absorption. The bullets are\nseen much more prominently in H$_2$O than in CO with respect to the central\ncomponent, and show little variation with excitation in H2O profile shape.\nExcitation conditions in the bullets derived from CO lines imply a temperature\n>150 K and density >10^5 cm^-3, similar to that of the broad component. The\nH2O/CO abundance ratio is similar in the \"bullets\" and the broad component, ~\n0.05-1.0, in spite of their different origins in the molecular jet and the\ninteraction between the outflow and the envelope. The high H2O abundance\nindicates that the bullets are H2 rich. The H2O cooling in the \"bullets\" and\nthe broad component is similar and higher than the CO cooling in the same\ncomponents.

We use the most\nrecent calibrations to derive virial black hole masses for samples of radio\nloud QSOs for which relatively small masses (M_BH<10^8 M_sun) have been\nestimated in the literature. We take into account the effect of radiation\npressure on the BLR which reduces the effective gravitational potential\nexperienced by the broad-line clouds and affects the mass estimates of bright\nquasars. We show that in well defined samples of nearby low luminosity AGNs,\nQSOs and AGNs from the SDSS, radio-loud (RL) AGN invariably host SMBHs\nexceeding ~10^8 M_sun. On the other hand, radio-quiet (RQ) AGNs are associated\nwith a much larger range of black hole masses. The overall result still holds\neven without correcting the BH mass estimates for the effects of radiation\npressure. We present a conjecture based on these results, which aims at\nexplaining the origin of radio-loudness in terms of two fundamental parameters:\nthe spin of the black hole and the black hole mass. We speculate that in order\nto produce a RL AGN both of the following requirements must be satisfied: 1)the\nblack hole mass M_BH has to be larger than ~10^8 M_sun; 2)the spin of the BH\nmust be significant, in order to satisfy theoretical requirements. Taking into\naccount the most recent observations, we envisage a scenario in which the\nmerger history of the host galaxy plays a fundamental role in accounting for\nboth the properties of the AGN and the galaxy morphology, which in our picture\nare strictly linked.

This population of massive, initial black hole seeds form at these\nearly epochs from the direct collapse of pre-galactic gas discs. Populating\ndark matter halos with seeds formed in this fashion, we follow their mass\nassembly history to the present time using a Monte-Carlo merger tree approach.\nUsing this formalism, we predict the black hole mass function at the present\ntime; the integrated mass density of black holes in the Universe; the\nluminosity function of accreting black holes as a function of redshift and the\nscatter in observed, local Mbh{\\sigma}s relation. Signatures of these massive\nseed models appear predominantly at the low mass end of the present day black\nhole mass function. In fact, our prediction of the shape of the Mbh{\\sigma}s\nrelation at the low mass end and increased scatter has recently been\ncorroborated by observations. These models predict that low surface brightness,\nbulge-less galaxies with large discs are least likely to be sites for the\nformation of massive seed black holes at high redshifts. The efficiency of seed\nformation at high redshifts also has a direct influence on the black hole\noccupation fraction in galaxies at z = 0. This effect is more pronounced for\nlow mass galaxies today as we predict the existence of a population of low mass\ngalaxies that do not host nuclear black holes. This is the key discriminant\nbetween the models studied here and the Population-III remnant seed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 21:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The importance of grain size distribution for the grain growth is\ndemonstrated in this paper. First, we derive an analytical formula that gives\nthe grain size distribution after the grain growth in individual clouds for any\ninitial grain size distribution. The time-scale of the grain growth is very\nsensitive to grain size distribution, since the grain growth is mainly\nregulated by the surface to volume ratio of grains. Next, we implement the\nresults of grain growth into dust enrichment models of entire galactic system\nalong with the grain formation and destruction in the interstellar medium,\nfinding that the grain growth in clouds governs the dust content in nearby\ngalaxies unless the grain size is strongly biased to sizes larger than $\\sim\n0.1 \\micron$ or the power index of the grain size distribution is shallower\nthan $\\sim -2.5$. The grain growth in clouds contributes to the rapid increase\nof dust-to-gas ratio at a certain metallicity level (called critical\nmetallicity in Asano et al. 2011 and and Inoue 2011), which we find to be\nsensitive to grain size distribution. Thus, the grain growth efficiently\nincrease the dust mass not only in nearby galaxies but also in high-redshift\nquasars, whose metallicities are larger than the critical value. Our recipe for\nthe grain growth is applicable for any grain size distribution and easily\nimplemented into any framework of dust enrichment in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 04:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

It is also\nfound that the spatial redistribution of the atoms over a finite size results\nin nonorthogonality of the collective bosonic modes. This nonorthogonality\nleads to the super-bunching effect that the correlations of photons of the\nindividual cavity modes and of different modes are stronger than those of a\nthermal field. However, we find that the correlations are not strong enough to\nviolate the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and to produce squeezing and entanglement\nbetween the modes. Therefore, we investigate the spectral distributions of the\nlogarithmic negativity and the variances of the output fields. These functions\ndetermine squeezing and entanglement properties of the output cavity fields and\ncan be measured by a homodyne technique.

In\nthis context, an original approach for generating machining process based on\nmachining knowledge is proposed in this paper. The core of this approach is to\ndecompose a CAD model of complex forging die in geometric features.\nTechnological data and topological relations are aggregated to a geometric\nfeature in order to create machining features. Technological data, such as\nmaterial, surface roughness and form tolerance are defined during forging\nprocess and dies design. These data are used to choose cutting tools and\nmachining strategies. Topological relations define relative positions between\nthe surfaces of the die CAD model. After machining features identification\ncutting tools and machining strategies currently used in HSM of forging die,\nare associated to them in order to generate machining sequences. A machining\nprocess model is proposed to formalize the links between information imbedded\nin the machining features and the parameters of cutting tools and machining\nstrategies. At last machining sequences are grouped and ordered to generate the\ncomplete die machining process. In this paper the identification of geometrical\nfeatures is detailed. Geometrical features identification is based on machining\nknowledge formalization which is translated in the generation of maps from STL\nmodels. A map based on the contact area between cutting tools and die shape\ngives basic geometrical features which are connected or not according to the\ncontinuity maps. The proposed approach is illustrated by an application on an\nindustrial study case which was accomplished as part of collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 07:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-26"}

The\ncoexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law motivates different\nunderstandings on the dependence between these two scalings, which is still\nhardly been clarified.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this article, we observe an evolution\nprocess of the scalings: the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law are naturally shaped\nto coexist at the initial time, while the crossover comes with the emergence of\ntheir inconsistency at the larger time before reaching a stable state, where\nthe Heaps' law still exists with the disappearance of strict Zipf's law. Such\nfindings are illustrated with a scenario of large-scale spatial epidemic\nspreading, and the empirical results of pandemic disease support a universal\nanalysis of the relation between the two laws regardless of the biological\ndetails of disease. Employing the United States(U.S.) domestic air\ntransportation and demographic data to construct a metapopulation model for\nsimulating the pandemic spread at the U.S. country level, we uncover that the\nbroad heterogeneity of the infrastructure plays a key role in the evolution of\nscaling emergence.\n  Conclusions/Significance: The analyses of large-scale spatial epidemic\nspreading help understand the temporal evolution of scalings, indicating the\ncoexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law depends on the collective\ndynamics of epidemic processes, and the heterogeneity of epidemic spread\nindicates the significance of performing targeted containment strategies at the\nearly time of a pandemic disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 08:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-26"}

Electronic band structures and\nfield-induced charge densities are compared with related literature data as\nwell as with own results on (AB) stacks. It is found, that the undoped\nAB-bilayer has a tiny Fermi line consisting of one electron pocket around the\nK-point and one hole pocket on the line K-$\\Gamma$. In contrast to (AB) stacks,\nthe breaking of translational symmetry by the surface of finite (ABC) stacks\nproduces a gap in the bulk-like states for slabs up to a yet unknown critical\nthickness $N^{\\rm semimet} \\gg 10$, while ideal (ABC) bulk ($\\beta$-graphite)\nis a semi-metal. Unlike in (AB) stacks, the ground state of (ABC) stacks is\nshown to be topologically non-trivial in the absence of external electric\nfield. Consequently, surface states crossing the Fermi level must unavoidably\nexist in the case of (ABC)-type stacking, which is not the case in (AB)-type\nstacks. These surface states in conjunction with the mentioned gap in the\nbulk-like states have two major implications. First, electronic transport\nparallel to the slab is confined to a surface region up to the critical layer\nnumber $N^{\\rm semimet}$. Related implications are expected for stacking domain\nwalls and grain boundaries. Second, the electronic properties of (ABC) stacks\nare highly tunable by an external electric field. In particular, the dielectric\nresponse is found to be strongly nonlinear and can e.g. be used to discriminate\nslabs with different layer numbers. Thus, (ABC) stacks rather than (AB) stacks\nwith more than two layers should be of potential interest for applications\nrelying on the tunability by an electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 10:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The\nARDF is defined as the minimum mutual information over an additive test channel\nfollowed by estimation.

In practice, WPT\nis implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic\nresonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for\nshort-/mid-/long-range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider\nthe EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry\nenergy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous\nwireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this\npaper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system\nconsisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another\nreceiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common\ntransmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with\nmultiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information\nreceiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from\nthe transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the\ntransmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal\ntransmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information\nrate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a\nso-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we\nshow an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential\nlimitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to\ndecode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two\npractical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and\npower splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to\nthe outer bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 12:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 11:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 06:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-18"}

This is especially the case in\nBayesian hierarchical models, where several decision theoretic frameworks can\nbe deployed. The estimation of these parameter ensembles may substantially vary\ndepending on which inferential goals are prioritised by the modeller. Since one\nmay wish to satisfy a range of desiderata, it is therefore of interest to\ninvestigate whether some sets of point estimates can simultaneously meet\nseveral inferential objectives. In this thesis, we will be especially concerned\nwith identifying ensembles of point estimates that produce good approximations\nof (i) the true empirical quantiles and empirical quartile ratio (QR) and (ii)\nprovide an accurate classification of the ensemble's elements above and below a\ngiven threshold. For this purpose, we review various decision-theoretic\nframeworks, which have been proposed in the literature in relation to the\noptimisation of different aspects of the empirical distribution of a parameter\nensemble. This includes the constrained Bayes (CB), weighted-rank squared error\nloss (WRSEL), and triple-goal (GR) ensembles of point estimates. In addition,\nwe also consider the set of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and the\nensemble of posterior means --the latter being optimal under the summed squared\nerror loss (SSEL). Firstly, we test the performance of these different sets of\npoint estimates as plug-in estimators for the empirical quantiles and empirical\nQR under a range of synthetic scenarios encompassing both spatial and\nnon-spatial simulated data sets. Performance evaluation is here conducted using\nthe posterior regret. Secondly, two threshold classification losses (TCLs)\n--weighted and unweighted-- are formulated and formally optimised.

[7,\n8, 10, 11] Reducing the recombination by surface passivation is crucial for the\nrealization of high performance nanosized optoelectronic devices, but remains\nlargely unexplored. [7, 12-14] Here we show that a thin layer of amorphous\nsilicon (a-Si) coated on a single-crystalline silicon nanowire (sc-SiNW),\nforming a core-shell structure in-situ in the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process,\nreduces the surface recombination nearly two orders of magnitude.

We also briefly discuss the connection to\nthe Moore-Read Pfaffian quantum Hall state, and extensions to the spinful case\nand to three-dimensonal topological superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 14:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 10:09:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 May 2012 14:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-12"}

It has recently been noted that many of these problems fall into\npolynomial time if the electorate is single-peaked (i.e., is polarized along\nsome axis/issue). However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked.\nThere are usually some mavericks, and so real-world electorates tend to merely\nbe nearly single-peaked. This paper studies the complexity of\nmanipulative-action algorithms for elections over nearly single-peaked\nelectorates, for various notions of nearness and various election systems.

Here, we present a formal method to assess the semantic capacity of\na chemical reaction network. The semantic capacity of a network can be measured\nby analyzing the capability of the network to implement molecular codes. We\nanalyzed models of real chemical systems (Martian atmosphere chemistry and\nvarious combustion chemistries), bio-chemical systems (gene expression, gene\ntranslation, and phosphorylation signaling cascades), as well as an artificial\nchemistry and random networks. Our study suggests that different chemical\nsystems posses different semantic capacities. Basically no semantic capacity\nwas found in the atmosphere chemistry of Mars and all studied combustion\nchemistries, as well as in highly connected random networks, i.e., with these\nchemistries molecular codes cannot be implemented. High semantic capacity was\nfound in the bio-chemical systems, as well as in random networks where the\nnumber of second order reactions is at the number of species. Hypotheses\nconcern the origin and evolution of life. We conclude that our approach can be\napplied to evaluate the information processing capabilities of a chemical\nsystem and may thus be a useful tool to understand the origin and evolution of\nmeaningful information, e.g., at the origin of life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 14:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-26"}

The dielectric properties of human blood are\nstudied using broadband dielectric spectroscopy, systematically investigating\nthe dependence on temperature and hematocrit value. By covering a frequency\nrange from 1 Hz to 40 GHz, information on all the typical dispersion regions of\nbiological matter is obtained. We find no evidence for a low-frequency\nrelaxation (alpha-relaxation) caused, e.g., by counterion diffusion effects as\nreported for some types of biological matter. The analysis of a strong\nMaxwell-Wagner relaxation arising from the polarization of the cell membranes\nin the 1-100 MHz region (beta-relaxation) allows for the test of model\npredictions and the determination of various intrinsic cell properties. In the\nmicrowave region beyond 1 GHz, the reorientational motion of water molecules in\nthe blood plasma leads to another relaxation feature (gamma-relaxation).\nBetween beta- and gamma-relaxation, significant dispersion is observed, which,\nhowever, can be explained by a superposition of these relaxation processes and\nis not due to an additional delta-relaxation often found in biological matter.\nOur measurements provide dielectric data on human blood of so far unsurpassed\nprecision for a broad parameter range.

The Cloud\nprovider offers its resources to two classes of customers: `premium' and\n`basic'. Premium customers pay upfront fees to reserve servers for a specified\nperiod of time (e.g. a year). Premium customers can submit jobs for their\nreserved servers at any time and pay a fee for the server-hours they use. The\nprovider is liable to pay a penalty every time a `premium' job can not be\nexecuted due to lack of resources. On the other hand, `basic' customers are\nserved on a best-effort basis, and pay a server-hour fee that may be higher\nthan the one paid by premium customers. The provider incurs energy costs when\nrunning servers. Hence, it has an incentive to turn off idle servers. The\nquestion of how to choose the number of servers to allocate to each pool (basic\nand premium) is answered by analyzing a suitable queuing model and maximizing a\nrevenue function.

Then, using the ratio of exponential sum rules where the QCD PT\nseries is more convergent, we study the correlation between the gluon\ncondensates <\\alpha_s G^2> and < g^3f_{abc} G^3>. From charmonium systems and\nusing the charm quark mass as input, we deduce:< g^3f_{abc} G^3>\n=(8.2+-1.0)GeV^2 <\\alpha_s G^2> corresponding to < \\alpha_s G^2>=(7.5+- 2.0)\n10^{-2} GeV^4. Using these results for the bottomium systems, we obtain:\nm_b(m_b)= 4212(32) MeV, which is slightly higher but consistent within the\nerrrors with the ones from Q^2-moments and their ratios: m_b(m_b)= 4172(12)\nMeV. We are tempted to consider as a final result from the sum rules\napproaches, the average m_b(m_b)= 4177(11) MeV of the two previous\ndeterminations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 15:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 18:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 11:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In\nthis paper, an interference network consisting of a point-to-point channel\ninterfering with a multiple access channel (MAC) is considered, with focus on\nthe weak interference scenario. Naive TIN in this network is performed by using\nGaussian codes at the transmitters, joint decoding at the MAC receiver while\ntreating interference as noise, and single user decoding at the point-to-point\nreceiver while treating both interferers as noise. It is shown that this naive\nTIN scheme is never optimal in this scenario. In fact, a scheme that combines\nboth time division multiple access and TIN outperforms the naive TIN scheme. An\nupper bound on the sum-capacity of the given network is also derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 15:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 07:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-27"}

In this context,\nparallel proximal algorithms and related alternating direction methods of\nmultipliers have become popular optimization techniques to approximate\niteratively the desired solution. Until now, in most of these methods, either\nLipschitz differentiability properties or tight frame representations were\nassumed. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to relax these\nassumptions by considering a class of non necessarily tight frame\nrepresentations, thus offering the possibility of addressing a broader class of\nsignal restoration problems. In particular, it is possible to use non\nnecessarily maximally decimated filter banks with perfect reconstruction, which\nare common tools in digital signal processing. The proposed approach allows us\nto solve both frame analysis and frame synthesis problems for various noise\ndistributions. In our simulations, it is applied to the deconvolution of data\ncorrupted with Poisson noise or Laplacian noise by using (non-tight) discrete\ndual-tree wavelet representations and filter bank structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 15:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 00:41:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 16:15:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 17:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
