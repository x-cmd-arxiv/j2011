In the first approach, an\nadditional time delay has to be assumed, because the frequency of the beam\nbounced from the accelerated reflector differs at the point of reflection from\nthat at the point of interference. The retarded times formalism is equivalent\nto a single Doppler shift, but results in the same correction as the beat\nfrequency approach, even though the latter is explicitly combines two Doppler\nshifts.

Best understood is neutral genetic variation at a single\nlocus, but additional insights can be gained by investigating genetic variation\nat multiple loci. The corresponding patterns of variation reflect linkage\ndisequilibrium and provide information about the underlying multi-locus gene\ngenealogies. The statistical properties of two-locus genealogies have been\nintensively studied for populations of constant census size, as well as for\nsimple demographic histories such as exponential population growth, and single\nbottlenecks. By contrast, the combined effect of recombination and sustained\ndemographic fluctuations is poorly understood. Addressing this issue, we study\na two-locus Wright-Fisher model of a population subject to recurrent\nbottlenecks. We derive coalescent approximations for the covariance of the\ntimes to the most recent common ancestor at two loci. We find, first, that an\neffective population-size approximation describes the numerically observed\nlinkage disequilibrium provided that recombination occurs either much faster or\nmuch more slowly than the population size changes. Second, when recombination\noccurs frequently between bottlenecks but rarely within bottlenecks, we observe\nlong-range linkage disequilibrium. Third, we show that in the latter case, a\ncommonly used measure of linkage disequilibrium, sigma_d^2 (closely related to\nr^2), fails to capture long-range linkage disequilibrium because constituent\nterms, each reflecting long-range linkage disequilibrium, cancel. Fourth, we\nanalyse a limiting case in which long-range linkage disequilibrium can be\ndescribed in terms of a Xi-coalescent process allowing for simultaneous\nmultiple mergers of ancestral lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 16:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-13"}

Our goal is to obtain bounds on the\nsteady state performance metrics such as the number of customers waiting in the\nqueue $Q^r(\\infty)$. While there is a rich literature on deriving process level\n(transient) scaling limits for such systems, the results for steady state are\nprimarily limited to the single class case.\n  This paper is the first one to address the case of heterogeneity in the\nsteady state regime. Moreover, our results hold for any service policy which\ndoes not admit server idling when there are customers waiting in the queue.

POLARIX is a mission dedicated to X-ray polarimetry.

Three Gas Pixel Detectors are coupled with three X-ray optics\nwhich are the heritage of JET-X mission. POLARIX will measure time resolved\nX-ray polarization with an angular resolution of about 20 arcsec in a field of\nview of 15 arcmin $\\times$ 15 arcmin and with an energy resolution of 20 % at 6\nkeV. The Minimum Detectable Polarization is 12 % for a source having a flux of\n1 mCrab and 10^5 s of observing time. The satellite will be placed in an\nequatorial orbit of 505 km of altitude by a Vega launcher.The telemetry\ndown-link station will be Malindi. The pointing of POLARIX satellite will be\ngyroless and it will perform a double pointing during the earth occultation of\none source, so maximizing the scientific return. POLARIX data are for 75 % open\nto the community while 25 % + SVP (Science Verification Phase, 1 month of\noperation) is dedicated to a core program activity open to the contribution of\nassociated scientists.

The interaction\nin this multiparameter BTBS-PDEs connection is novel, leads to an\nintimately-connected linear system variant of the celebrated\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE, and is not shared with its one-time-parameter\ncounterpart. It also means that these PDEs systems are to be solved for a\nfamily of functions, a feature exhibited in well known fluids dynamics models.\nOn the other hand, the memory-preserving interaction between the PDE solution\nand the initial data is common to both the single and the multi parameter\nBrownian-time PDEs. Here, we introduce a new---even in the one parameter\ncase---proof that judiciously combines stochastic analysis with analysis and\nfractional calculus to simultaneously link BTBS to a new system of temporally\nhalf-derivative interacting PDEs as well as to the fourth order system proved\nearlier and differently by Allouba.

Which\nmethods are best suited to verify the bulk of these models? The first step is\nto select a formal language which fixes the semantics of the models. We adopt\nthe language of Boolean systems as reference language for Boolean process\nmodels. Boolean systems form a simple subclass of coloured Petri nets. Their\ncharacteristics are low tokens to model explicitly states with a subsequent\nskipping of activations and arbitrary logical rules of type AND, XOR, OR etc.\nto model the split and join of the control flow. We apply model checking as a\nverification method for the safeness and liveness of Boolean systems. Model\nchecking of Boolean systems uses the elementary theory of propositional logic,\nno modal operators are needed. Our verification builds on a finite complete\nprefix of a certain T-system attached to the Boolean system. It splits the\nprocesses of the Boolean system into a finite set of base processes of bounded\nlength. Their behaviour translates to formulas from propositional logic. Our\nverification task consists in checking the satisfiability of these formulas. In\naddition we have implemented our model checking algorithm as a java program.\nThe time needed to verify a given Boolean system depends critically on the\nnumber of initial tokens. Because the algorithm has to solve certain\nSAT-problems, polynomial complexity cannot be expected. The paper closes with\nthe model checking of some Boolean process models which have been designed as\nEvent-driven Process Chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 18:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-04"}

The incidence of such LLSs per unit\nredshift, l(z)=dn/dz, at these redshifts is well described by a single power\nlaw, l(z) = C1 (1+z)^gamma, with gamma=1.33 +/- 0.61 at z<2.6, or with\ngamma=1.83 +/- 0.21 over the redshift range 0.2 < z < 4.9. The incidence of\nLLSs per absorption distance, l(X), decreases by a factor of ~1.5 over the ~0.6\nGyr from z=4.9 to 3.5; l(X) evolves much more slowly at low redshifts,\ndecreasing by a similar factor over the ~8 Gyr from z=2.6 to 0.25.

The LOFAR radio telescope is different, and uses tens of thousands of\nfixed, non-movable antennas instead, a novel design that promises\nground-breaking research in astronomy. The antennas observe omnidirectionally,\nand sky sources are observed by signal-processing techniques that combine the\ndata from all antennas.\n  Another new feature of LOFAR is the elaborate use of software to do signal\nprocessing in real time, where traditional telescopes use custom-built\nhardware. The use of software leads to an instrument that is inherently more\nflexible. However, the enormous data rate (198 Gb/s of input data) and\nprocessing requirements compel the use of a supercomputer: we use an IBM Blue\nGene/P.\n  This paper presents a collection of new processing pipelines, collectively\ncalled the beam-forming pipelines, that greatly enhance the functionality of\nthe telescope. Where our first pipeline could only correlate data to create sky\nimages, the new pipelines allow the discovery of unknown pulsars, observations\nof known pulsars, and (in the future), to observe cosmic rays and study\ntransient events. Unlike traditional telescopes, we can observe in hundreds of\ndirections simultaneously. This is useful, for example, to search the sky for\nnew pulsars. The use of software allows us to quickly add new functionality and\nto adapt to new insights that fully exploit the novel features and the power of\nour unique instrument. We also describe our optimisations to use the Blue\nGene/P at very high efficiencies, maximising the effectiveness of the entire\ntelescope.

Using an hybrid scheme that couples numerical three-body\nscatterings to an analytical formalism for the cusp-binary interaction, we\nverify this hypothesis by evolving the MBHB in spherically symmetric cusps with\ndifferent fractions F of co-rotating stars. Consistently with previous works,\nbinaries in isotropic cusps (F=0.5) tend to increase their eccentricity, and\nwhen F approaches zero (counter-rotating cusps) the eccentricity rapidly\nincreases to almost unity. Conversely, binaries in cusps with a significant\ndegree of co-rotation (F>0.7) tend to become less and less eccentric,\ncircularising quite quickly for F approaching unity.

It is determined\nusing the protostellar mass function (PMF) in combination with a stellar\nevolutionary model that provides the luminosity as a function of instantaneous\nand final stellar mass. As in McKee & Offner (2010), we consider three main\naccretion models: the Isothermal Sphere model, the Turbulent Core model, and an\napproximation of the Competitive Accretion model. We also consider the effect\nof an accretion rate that tapers off linearly in time and an accelerating star\nformation rate. For each model, we characterize the luminosity distribution\nusing the mean, median, maximum, ratio of the median to the mean, standard\ndeviation of the logarithm of the luminosity, and the fraction of very low\nluminosity objects. We compare the models with bolometric luminosities observed\nin local star forming regions and find that models with an approximately\nconstant accretion time, such as the Turbulent Core and Competitive Accretion\nmodels, appear to agree better with observation than those with a constant\naccretion rate, such as the Isothermal Sphere model. We show that observations\nof the mean protostellar luminosity in these nearby regions of low-mass star\nformation suggest a mean star formation time of 0.3$\\pm$0.1 Myr. Such a\ntimescale, together with some accretion that occurs non-radiatively and some\nthat occurs in high-accretion, episodic bursts, resolves the classical\n\"luminosity problem\" in low-mass star formation, in which observed protostellar\nluminosities are significantly less than predicted. An accelerating star\nformation rate is one possible way of reconciling the observed star formation\ntime and mean luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 00:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Here we\naddress this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly,\nthis setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus,\nchallenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also\nfrom the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length\nrestriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design\nthat was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such\nconstraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to\noccur given the constraints of this new environment.

This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic\nstyle accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real\nworld setting.

We start with a number of\nknown techniques allowing for analytic calculation of the propagation of small\nperturbations on top of the expanding fireball. The simplest approximation is\nthe \"geometric acoustics\", which substitutes the wave equation by mechanical\nequations for the propagating \"phonons\". Next we turn to the case in which\nvariables can be separated, in which case one can obtain not only the eikonal\nphases but also amplitudes of the perturbation. Finally, we focus on the so\ncalled Gubser flow, a particular conformal analytic solution for the fireball\nexpansion, on top of which one can derive closed equations for small\nperturbations. Perfect hydrodynamics allows all variables to be separated and\nall equations to be solved in terms of known special functions. We can thus\ncollect the analytical expression for all the harmonics and reconstruct the\ncomplete Green function of the problem. In the viscous case the equations still\nallow for variable separation, but one of the equations has to be solved\nnumerically. We still can collect all the harmonics and show real-time\nperturbation evolution, observing viscosity-induced changes in the spectra and\nthe correlation functions of secondaries.

In each\nmodel, the condensation mass increases linearly with radius on small scales,\nand more rapidly on large scales, as in \"thermal-nonthermal\" models. Spherical\ncondensations with this structure form protostars which match the IMF if their\ninfall is subject to equally likely stopping. However such spherical models do\nnot match the filamentary nature of cluster gas, and they are too extended to\nform protostars having high mass and short spacing. Two hybrid models are\npresented, which are spherical on small scales and filamentary on large scales.\nIn and around clusters, cores embedded in linear filaments match the elongation\nof cluster gas, and the central concentration of low-mass stars. In cluster\ncenters, condensations require a low volume filling factor to produce massive\nstars with short spacing. These may have stellate shape, where cores are nodes\nof filamentary networks, as seen in some simulations of colliding flows and of\ncollapsing turbulent clumps. A dense configuration of such stellate\ncondensations may be indistinguishable from a clump forming multiple protostars\nvia filamentary flow paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 20:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The\nproposed mixed formulation is tested using a wide variety of numerical\nexamples. The proposed formulation is also implemented in a parallel setting,\nand the performance of the formulation for large-scale problems is illustrated\nusing a representative problem. Two practical and technologically important\nproblems, one each on enhanced oil recovery and geological carbon-dioxide\nsequestration, are solved using the proposed formulation. The numerical\nexamples show that the predictions based on Darcy model are qualitatively and\nquantitatively different from that of the predictions based on the modified\nDarcy model, which takes into account the dependence of the viscosity on the\npressure. In particular, the numerical example on the geological carbon-dioxide\nsequestration shows that Darcy model over-predicts the leakage into an\nabandoned well when compared to that of the modified Darcy model. On the other\nhand, the modified Darcy model predicts higher pressures and higher pressure\ngradients near the injection well.

I. The synchrotron peak luminosities (L_{s})\nsignificantly inverse correlate with the synchrotron peak frequencies\n(\\nu_{s}), L_{s}\\propto\\nu_{s}^{-0.44}, which is consistent with the blazar\nsequence. In addition to the correlation, there are some blazars showing low\n\\nu_{s} and low L_{s}. To study the relation between these low \\nu_{s} low\nL_{s} blazars and the blazar sequence, we present correlations of the parameter\nL_{s}\\nu_{s}^{1/4} with the ratio of Compton to synchrotron peak frequencies\n(r_{Cs}\\equiv\\nu_{C}/\\nu_{s}) and with the ratio of Compton to synchrotron\nluminosities (CD\\equiv L_{C}/L_{s}). The results indicate that both\ncorrelations are significant with a Pearson's probability for null correlation\nof p=0.0218 and p=0.0286 respectively. This does not support the idea that the\nlow \\nu_{s} low L_{s} blazars are sources with less beaming. Another\npossibility, as suggested by Ghisellini & Tavecchio, is that these blazars have\nrelative lower black hole masses. To test this, we collect the black hole\nmasses of 30 blazars from archives, and find that the hole mass correlates with\nthe parameter L_{s}\\nu_{s}^{0.44} (p=0.0344). Therefore, the black hole masses\nof low \\nu_{s} low L_{s} blazars are statistically small. The NLS1s are thought\nto have lower black hole masses. We find that the four NLS1s detected by Fermi\nhave low \\nu_{s} and low L_{s}. This supports the above result. II. The ratio\nr_{Cs} correlates with CD significantly (p=0.00375). The external Compton (EC)\nmodel can naturally explain this correlation, while synchrotron self Compton\n(SSC) model can not. This agrees with the findings of many authors that the EC\nprocess dominates the gamma-ray emission of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 01:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In a second, fixed filter configuration, cascaded\nfour-wave mixing simultaneously broadens and smoothes comb spectra, resulting\nin Gaussian RF filter lineshapes exhibiting extremely high (>60 dB) main lobe\nto sidelobe suppression ratio and (>70 dB) stopband attenuation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 02:19:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 03:09:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 20:41:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 18:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

In such a heterogeneous environment, the role of\ninterference management (IM) becomes of more importance, but technical\nchallenges also increase, since the number of cell-edge users, suffering from\nsevere interference from the neighboring cells, will naturally grow. In order\nto overcome low performance and/or high complexity of existing static and other\ndynamic IM algorithms, we propose a novel low-complex and fully distributed IM\nscheme, called REFIM, in the downlink of heterogeneous multi-cell networks. We\nfirst formulate a general optimization problem that turns out to require\nintractable computation complexity for global optimality. To have a practical\nsolution with low computational and signaling overhead, which is crucial for\nlow-cost small-cell solutions, e.g., femto cells, in REFIM, we decompose it\ninto per-BS problems based on the notion of reference user and reduce feedback\noverhead over backhauls both temporally and spatially. We evaluate REFIM\nthrough extensive simulations under various configurations, including the\nscenarios from a real deployment of BSs. We show that, compared to the schemes\nwithout IM, REFIM can yield more than 40% throughput improvement of cell-edge\nusers while increasing the overall performance by 10~107%. This is equal to\nabout 95% performance of the existing centralized IM algorithm that is known to\nbe near-optimal but hard to implement in practice due to prohibitive\ncomplexity.

Adopting a solid-body rotation model\nwith a simple gravity darkening prescription, we modeled the stellar geometric\nproperties and surface temperature distributions, confirming both stars are\nrapidly rotating and show gravity darkening anomalies. We estimate the masses\nand ages of these rapid rotators on L-Rpol and HR diagrams constructed for\nnon-rotating stars by tracking their non-rotating equivalents. The unexpected\nfast rotation of the evolved subgiant {\\beta} Cas offers a unique test of the\nstellar core-envelope coupling, revealing quite efficient coupling over the\npast ~ 0.5 Gyr. Lastly we summarize all our interferometric determinations of\nthe gravity darkening coefficient for rapid rotators, finding none match the\nexpectations from the widely used von Zeipel gravity darkening laws.

However, some recent observations showed that the expected number\nof the mass-accreting WD is much lower than that predicted from theory,\nwhatever in spiral or elliptical galaxies. In this paper, we did a binary\npopulation synthesis study on the relative duration of the SSS phase to their\nwhole mass-increasing phase of WDs leading to SNe Ia. We found that for about\n40% progenitor systems, the relative duration is shorter than 2% and the\nevolution of the mean relative duration shows that it is always smaller than\n5%, whatever for young or old SNe Ia. In addition, before SNe Ia explosion,\nmore than 55% progenitor systems are experiencing a dwarf novae phase, and only\nno more than 10% is staying SSS phase.

In online games, usually\na human user competes with others, so the fairness of the game system to all\nusers is of great importance not to lose interests of users on the game.\nFurthermore, the emergence and success of electronic sports (e-sports) and\nprofessional gaming which specially talented gamers compete with others draws\nmore attention on whether they are competing in the fair environment. No matter\nhow fierce the debates are in the game-design community, it is rarely the case\nthat one employs statistical analysis to answer this question seriously. But\nconsidering the fact that we can easily gather large amount of user behavior\ndata on games, it seems potentially beneficial to make use of this data to aid\nmaking decisions on design problems of games. Actually, modern games do not aim\nto perfectly design the game at once: rather, they first release the game, and\nthen monitor users' behavior to better balance the game. In such a scenario,\nstatistical analysis can be particularly helpful. Specifically, we chose to\nanalyze the balance of StarCraft II, which is a very successful\nrecently-released real-time strategy (RTS) game.

We imaged the continuum emission at 3 mm and\n1.3 mm of the Herbig Ae/Be stars BD+61154, RR Tau, VY Mon and LkHa 198 using\nthe Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). These stars are in the upper end of\nthe stellar mass range of the Herbig Ae stars (stellar mass greater than 3\nsolar masses). Our measurements were used to complete the Spectral Energy\nDistribution (SED). The modelling of the SED, in particular the FIR-mm part,\nallow us to determine the masses and dust properties of these disks. We\ndetected the disks associated with BD+61154, RR Tau and VY Mon with disk masses\nof 0.35 Msun, 0.05 Msun and 0.40 Msun respectively. The disk around LkHa 198\nwas not detected with an upper limit to the disk mass of 0.004 Msun. We\ndetected, however, the disks associated with the younger stellar objects LkHa\n198--IR and LkHa 198-mm that are located in the vicinity of LkHa 198. The\nfitting of the mm part of the SED reveal that the grains in the mid-plane of\nthe disks around BD+61154, RR Tau and VY Mon have sizes of 1--1000 microns.\nTherefore, grains have not grown to centimetre sizes in these disks yet. These\nmassive (M>3 Msun) and young (about 1 Myr) HAe stars are surrounded by massive\n(>0.04 Msun) disks with grains of micron-millimetre sizes. Although grain\ngrowth is proceeding in these disks, their evolutionary stage is prior to the\nformation of planetesimals. These disks are less evolved than those detected\naround T Tauri and Herbig Be stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 08:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The temporary trapping of the atoms' scattering\nwavefunction corresponds to an enhanced atom pair density at low interatomic\nseparations. This leads to larger overlap of the wavefunctions involved in a\nmolecule formation process such as photoassociation, rendering the process more\nefficient. However, for an ensemble of atoms, the atom pair density will only\nbe enhanced if the energy of the resonance comes close to the temperature of\nthe atomic ensemble.

We prove two maximum entropy theorems that strengthen\npreviously known results. The proof of the former theorem is based on the\nso-called circular analog of a given complex-valued random vector. Its\nintroduction is supported by a characterization theorem that employs a minimum\nKullback-Leibler divergence criterion.

Furthermore, we address the capacity of multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) channels. Regardless of the specific distribution of the\nchannel parameters (noise vector and channel matrix, if modeled as random), we\nshow that the capacity-achieving input vector is circular for a broad range of\nMIMO channels (including coherent and noncoherent scenarios). Finally, we\ninvestigate the situation of an improper and Gaussian distributed noise vector.\nWe compute both capacity and capacity-achieving input vector and show that\nimproperness increases capacity, provided that the complementary covariance\nmatrix is exploited.

In this paper we present an investigation into the nature\nof the dusty Wolf-Rayet star and candidate binary W239. We determined an\norbital period of only 5.05 days - making it one of the most compact WC\nbinaries yet identified - while we interpret a significant near-IR flare\nbetween 2004-6 as evidence for a third massive stellar component in the system\nin a wide eccentric orbit. The presence of a near-IR excess characteristic of\nhot dust at every epoch is consistent with the expectation that the subset of\npersistent dust forming WC stars are short period binaries. In conjunction with\nprevious results, the simultaneous presence of both short period Wolf-Rayet\nbinaries and cool hypergiants within Wd 1 provides compelling evidence for a\nbifurcation in the post-Main Sequence evolution of massive stars due to\nbinarity. Short period O+OB binaries will evolve directly to the Wolf-Rayet\nphase, either due to an episode of binary mediated mass loss or via chemically\nhomogenous evolution. Conversely, long period binaries and single stars will\ninstead undergo a red loop across the HR diagram via a cool hypergiant phase.\nFuture analysis of the full spectroscopic dataset for Wd 1 will constrain the\nproportion of massive stars experiencing each pathway; hence quantifying the\nimportance of binarity in massive stellar evolution up to and beyond supernova\nand the resultant production of relativistic remnants and X-ray binaries.\n[ABRIDGED]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 09:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Excluded volume interactions due to chain stacking and spatial\ndistribution also has a bearing on the stress response. The bond length\ndistribution along the chain is not uniform. Rather, the bond lengths at the\nend of the chains are larger and uniformly decrease towards the middle of the\nchain from both ends. The effect is due to the presence of cross-linkers. As\nwith linear polymers, at high density values, changes in mean-square bond\nlength dominates over changes in radius of gyration and end-to-end length. That\nis, bond deformations dominate over changes in size and shape. A large change\nin the mean-square bond length reflects in a jump in the stress response.\nShort-chain polymers more or less behave like rigid molecules. Temperature has\na peculiar effect on the response in the sense that even though bond lengths\nincrease with temperature, stress response decreases with increasing\ntemperature. This is due to the dominance of excluded volume effects which\nresult in lower stresses at higher temperatures. At low strain rates, some\nrelaxation in the bond stretch is observed from $\\epsilon=0.2$ to\n$\\epsilon=0.5$. At high strain rates, internal deformation of the chains\ndominate over their uncoiling leading to a rise in the stress levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 12:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

The bistability mechanism is also related to the\ndifferent wind parameters during visual minima: the wind terminal velocity was\n2-3 times higher and the mass-loss rate roughly two times smaller in 1985-1990\nthan in 2000-2003. We obtain a projected rotational velocity of 220 +- 50 km/s\nduring 1985-1990 which, combined with the high luminosity (L=1.5x10^6 Lsun),\nputs AG Car extremely close to the Eddington limit modified by rotation\n(Omega-Gamma limit): for an inclination angle of 90 deg, Gamma_Omega > 1.0 for\nM< 60 Msun. Based on evolutionary models and mass budget, we obtain an initial\nmass of ~ 100 Msun and a current mass of 60-70 Msun for AG Car. Therefore, AG\nCar is close to, if not at, the Omega-Gamma limit during visual minimum.\nAssuming M=70 Msun, we find that Gamma_Omega decreases from 0.93 to 0.72 as AG\nCar expands toward visual maximum, suggesting that the star is not above the\nEddington limit during maximum phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 13:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such\nlarge-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation\noffers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available\nimputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or\ncategorical. For mixed-type data the different types are usually handled\nseparately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable\ntypes. We propose a nonparametric method which can cope with different types of\nvariables simultaneously. We compare several state of the art methods for the\nimputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation\nmethod (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned\nclassification or regression trees random forest intrinsically constitutes a\nmultiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of\nrandom forest we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of\na test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple data sets coming from a diverse\nselection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values\nranging from 10% to 30%. We show that missForest can successfully handle\nmissing values, particularly in data sets including different types of\nvariables. In our comparative study missForest outperforms other methods of\nimputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and nonlinear\nrelations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of\nmissForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest\nexhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 13:53:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 14:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-03"}

Our experiments validate this theory showing that our T-statistic\nbased greedy feature selection is more robust at avoiding overfitting than the\nclassical greedy procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 15:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

More generally, we prove a\nsimilar result for the Galois groups associated with elements in any connected\nsemisimple linear algebraic group defined and simple over a number field $F$.\nOur method is based on the abstract large sieve method developed by Kowalski,\nand the study of Galois groups via reductions modulo primes developed by Jouve,\nKowalski and Zywina. The two key ingredients are a uniform quantitative lattice\npoint counting result, and a non-concentration phenomenon for lattice points in\nalgebraic subvarieties of the group variety, both established previously by the\nauthors. The results answer a question posed by Rivin and by Jouve, Kowalski\nand Zywina, who have considered Galois groups of random products of elements in\nalgebraic groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 15:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

The RGB of NGC 288 is\nclearly split into two in the hk [=(Ca - b) - (b - y)] index, while the split\nis not shown in the b - y color. Unlike other globular clusters with multiple\npopulations reported thus far, the horizontal branch of NGC 288 is only mildly\nextended. Our stellar population models show that this and the presence of two\ndistinct RGBs in NGC 288 can be reproduced if slightly metal-rich (\\Delta [m/H]\n$\\approx$ 0.16) second generation stars are also enhanced in helium by small\namount (\\Delta Y $\\approx$ 0.03) and younger by ~ 1.5 Gyrs. The RGB split in hk\nindex is most likely indicating that the second generation stars were affected\nby supernovae enrichment, together with the pollutions of lighter elements by\nintermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars or fast-rotating massive stars.\nIn order to confirm this, however, spectroscopy of stars in the two distinct\nRGB groups is urgently required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 20:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We have considered a model of the universe filled with\nmodified Chaplygin gas and barotropic fluid. The role of dynamical cosmological\nconstant has been explored with Modified Chaplygin Gas as the background fluid.\nVarious phenomenological models for \\Lambda have been studied in presence of\nthe gravitational constant G to be constant or time dependent. A new form of\nthe well known Chaplygin gas model has been presented by introducing\ninhomogeneity in the EOS. This model explains w=-1 crossing. An interaction of\nthis model with the scalar field has also been investigated through a\nphenomenological coupling function. Tachyonic field has been depicted as dark\nenergy model to represent the present acceleration of the Universe. A mixture\nof the tachyonic fluid has been considered with Generalized Chaplygin Gas to\nshow the role of the later as a dark energy candidate in presence of tachyonic\nmatter. A model of interaction has been studied with scalar field and the\ninhomogeneous ideal fluid. Two forms of the ideal fluid have been analysed. A\npower law expansion for the scale factor has been assumed to solve the\nequations for the energy densities. Brans-Dicke theory has been used to\ninvestigate the possibility of obtaining cosmic acceleration. For this purpose\na constant and a variable \\omega (Brans-Dicke parameter) have been considered.\nA self-interacting potential has been introduced to show its role in the\nevolution of the Universe.
