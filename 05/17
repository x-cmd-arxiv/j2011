One of the reasons for this is that the identification of the quantum\nof gravity is still very elusive.

On the other hand, information theory has at its base the unit of\ninformation, the bit, and relies upon this entity that has no clear or\ndefinitely identified physical properties either.

That is,\nsymbols transmitted by different transmitters could arrive at the receiver with\nsymbol misalignment as well as relative carrier-phase offset. A second\nimportant issue is how to integrate channel coding with PNC to achieve reliable\ncommunication. This paper investigates these two issues and makes the following\ncontributions: 1) We propose and investigate a general framework for decoding\nat the receiver based on belief propagation (BP). The framework can effectively\ndeal with symbol and phase asynchronies while incorporating channel coding at\nthe same time. 2) For unchannel-coded PNC, we show that for BPSK and QPSK\nmodulations, our BP method can significantly reduce the asynchrony penalties\ncompared with prior methods. 3) For unchannel-coded PNC, with half symbol\noffset between the transmitters, our BP method can drastically reduce the\nperformance penalty due to phase asynchrony, from more than 6 dB to no more\nthan 1 dB. 4) For channel-coded PNC, with our BP method, both symbol and phase\nasynchronies actually improve the system performance compared with the\nperfectly synchronous case. Furthermore, the performance spread due to\ndifferent combinations of symbol and phase offsets between the transmitters in\nchannel-coded PNC is only around 1 dB. The implication of 3) is that if we\ncould control the symbol arrival times at the receiver, it would be\nadvantageous to deliberately introduce a half symbol offset in unchannel-coded\nPNC. The implication of 4) is that when channel coding is used, symbol and\nphase asynchronies are not major performance concerns in PNC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 16:48:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 07:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 May 2011 12:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2011 13:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Here we demonstrate that the linear slow-fast coupling with the\ntotal energy conservation property promotes the suppression of chaos at the\nslow variables through the rapid mixing at the fast variables, both\ntheoretically and through numerical simulations. A suitable mathematical\nframework is developed, connecting the slow dynamics on the tangent subspaces\nto the infinite-time linear response of the mean state to a constant external\nforcing at the fast variables. Additionally, it is shown that the uncoupled\ndynamics for the slow variables may remain chaotic while the complete\nmultiscale system loses chaos and becomes completely predictable at the slow\nvariables through increasing chaos and turbulence at the fast variables.

The methods to\ndetect extrasolar moons, or \"exomoons\" are more subtle than their planetary\ncounterparts and in this thesis I aim to provide a method to find such bodies\nin transiting systems, which offer the greatest potential for detection. Before\none can search for the tiny perturbations to the planetary signal, an\nunderstanding of the planetary transit must be established. Therefore, in\nChapters 3 to 5 I discuss the transit model and provide several new insights.\nChapter 4 presents new analytic expressions for the times of transit minima and\nthe transit duration, which will be critical in the later search for exomoons.\nChapter 5 discusses two sources of distortion to the transit signal, namely\nblending (with a focus on the previously unconsidered self-blending scenario)\nand light curve smearing due to long integration times. I provide methods to\ncompensate for both of these effects, thus permitting for the accurate\nmodelling of the planetary transit light curve. In Chapter 6, I discuss methods\nto detect exomoons through their gravitational influence on the host planet,\ngiving rise to transit timing and duration variations (TTV and TDV). The\npreviously known TTV effect is updated with a new model and the associated\ncritical problems are outlined. I then predict a new effect, TDV, which solves\nthese problems, making exomoon detection viable.

Due to the no-hair theorem,\nhowever, such spacetimes cannot be regular everywhere outside the event\nhorizons, if they are solutions to the Einstein field equations; they are often\ncharacterized by naked singularities or closed time-like loops in the regions\nof the spacetime that are accessible to an external observer. For observational\ntests of the no-hair theorem that involve phenomena in the vicinity of the\ncircular photon orbit or the innermost stable circular orbit around a black\nhole, these pathologies limit the applicability of the metrics only to compact\nobjects that do not spin rapidly.

We derive\nexpressions for the energy and angular momentum of a particle on a circular\nequatorial orbit around the black hole and compute the locations of the\ninnermost stable circular orbit and the circular photon orbit. We demonstrate\nthat these orbits change significantly for even moderate deviations from the\nKerr metric.

The astrometric coincidence of the\nsource with the center of its host galaxy, together with other considerations,\nmotivated the interpretation that Sw 1644+57 was produced by an outburst from a\n10^{6-7} M_sun black hole at the center of the galaxy.

Both neutron star (magnetar) spindown and black hole accretion can power\nsuch events. The requirements for producing low-power, very long-duration GRBs\nby magnetar spindown are similar to those for powering extremely luminous\nsupernovae by magnetar spindown, suggesting a possible connection between these\ntwo unusual types of transients. Alternatively, Sw 1644+57 be associated with\nthe faintest core-collapse explosions: the collapse of a rotating red\nsupergiant in a nominally failed supernova can power accretion onto a\nsolar-mass black hole for up to ~ 100 days; the jet produced by black hole\naccretion inevitably unbinds the outer envelope of the progenitor, leading to a\nweak ~ 10^{49} erg explosion.

The fundamental plane suggests that, at\nlow-accretion rates, the physical processes regulating the conversion of an\naccretion flow into radiative energy could be universal across the entire black\nhole mass scale. However, there is still a need to further refine the\nfundamental plane in order to better discern the radiative processes and their\ngeometry very close to the black hole, in particular the source of hard X-rays.\nFurther refinement is necessary because error bars on the best-fit slopes of\nthe fundamental plane are generally large, and also the inferred coefficients\ncan be sensitive to the adopted sample of black holes. In this work, we regress\nthe fundamental plane with a Bayesian technique. Our approach shows that\nsub-Eddington black holes emit X-ray emission that is predominantly optically\nthin synchrotron radiation from the jet, provided that their radio spectra are\nflat or inverted. X-ray emission dominated by very radiatively inefficient\naccretion flows are excluded at the >3\\sigma\\ level. We also show that it is\ndifficult to place FR I galaxies onto the fundamental plane because their X-ray\njet emission is highly affected by synchrotron cooling. On the other hand, BL\nLac objects fit onto the fundamental plane.

Also, present work\nproposes the implementation of the so-called SCYL program (Supersymmetric\nCosmology at Yonder Locals), an attempt to apply supergravity as a meta-field\ntheory to solve problems on astrophysical cosmology. The SCYL program is an\neffort directed to search convergence between the knowledge brought by\ncosmology and by supersymmetry to attain more clearness about the structure and\nevolution of the Universe. As an additional motivation, there are some\nexercises in the final part of the work to aid fixing of the main concepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 20:34:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 18:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 20:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

Ganalyzer works by separating the galaxy pixels from\nthe background pixels, finding the center and radius of the galaxy, generating\nthe radial intensity plot, and then computing the slopes of the peaks detected\nin the radial intensity plot to measure the spirality of the galaxy and\ndetermine its morphological class. Unlike algorithms that are based on machine\nlearning, Ganalyzer is based on measuring the spirality of the galaxy, a task\nthat is difficult to perform manually, and in many cases can provide a more\naccurate analysis compared to manual observation. Ganalyzer is simple to use,\nand can be easily embedded into other image analysis applications. Another\nadvantage is its speed, which allows it to analyze ~10,000,000 galaxy images in\nfive days using a standard modern desktop computer. These capabilities can make\nGanalyzer a useful tool in analyzing large datasets of galaxy images collected\nby autonomous sky surveys such as SDSS, LSST or DES.

Since then, a great deal of evidence has been accumulated which\nsuggests that the ABJM theory is integrable in the planar limit. Integrability\nis a very useful property that allows many physical observables, such as\nanomalous dimensions and scattering amplitudes, to be computed efficiently. In\nthe first half of this thesis, we will explain how to use integrabilty to\ncompute the anomalous dimensions of long, single-trace operators in the ABJM\ntheory. In particular, we will describe how to compute them at weak coupling\nusing a Bethe Ansatz, and how to compute them at strong coupling using string\ntheory. The latter approach involves using algebraic curve and world-sheet\ntechniques to compute the energies of string states dual to gauge theory\noperators. In the second half of this thesis, we will discuss integrability\nfrom the point of view of on-shell scattering amplitudes in the ABJM theory.

ThinkAir exploits the concept of smartphone virtualization in the\ncloud and provides method level computation offloading. Advancing on previous\nworks, it focuses on the elasticity and scalability of the server side and\nenhances the power of mobile cloud computing by parallelizing method execution\nusing multiple Virtual Machine (VM) images. We evaluate the system using a\nrange of benchmarks starting from simple micro-benchmarks to more complex\napplications. First, we show that the execution time and energy consumption\ndecrease two orders of magnitude for the N-queens puzzle and one order of\nmagnitude for a face detection and a virus scan application, using cloud\noffloading. We then show that if a task is parallelizable, the user can request\nmore than one VM to execute it, and these VMs will be provided dynamically. In\nfact, by exploiting parallelization, we achieve a greater reduction on the\nexecution time and energy consumption for the previous applications. Finally,\nwe use a memory-hungry image combiner tool to demonstrate that applications can\ndynamically request VMs with more computational power in order to meet their\ncomputational requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 21:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Among all clusters/groups of a flux-limited X-ray sample, we predict\nVirgo, Fornax and M49 to be the brightest DM sources and find a particularly\nlow CR-induced background for Fornax. For a minimum substructure mass given by\nthe DM free-streaming scale, cluster halos maximize the substructure boost for\nwhich we find a factor above 1000. Since regions around the virial radius\ndominate the annihilation flux of substructures, the resulting surface\nbrightness profiles are almost flat.

Assuming cold dark\nmatter with a substructure mass distribution down to an Earth mass and using\nextended Fermi upper limits, we rule out the leptophilic models in their\npresent form in 28 clusters, and limit the boost from SFE in M49 and Fornax to\nbe < 5.

Using individual cluster\nobservations, it will be challenging for Fermi to constrain our selection of DM\nbenchmark models without SFE.

These new methods have largely been based on approximations that\nside-step the need for measurement-to-track association. Comparably, RFS\nmethods that incorporate data association, such as Morelande and Challa's (M-C)\nmethod, have received little attention. This paper provides a RFS algorithm\nthat incorporates data association similarly to the M-C method, but retains\ncomputational tractability via a recently developed approximation of marginal\nassociation weights. We describe an efficient method for resolving the track\ncoalescence phenomenon which is problematic for joint probabilistic data\nassociation (JPDA) and related methods (including M-C). The method utilises a\nnetwork flow optimisation, and thus is tractable for large numbers of targets.\nFinally, our derivation also shows that it is natural for the multi-target\ndensity to incorporate both a Poisson point process (PPP) component\n(representing targets that have never been detected) and a multi-Bernoulli\ncomponent (representing targets under track). We describe a method of\nrecycling, in which tracks with a low probability existence are transferred\nfrom the multi-Bernoulli component to the PPP component, effectively yielding a\nhybrid of M-C and PHD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2011 08:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The difficulty on treating the\nsystems is originated from the fact that the motion in time domain and the\nmotion in spatial domain are coupled together completely. Generally, for a\nHamilton dynamic system established by a set of general velocity functions,\nseveral abstract theories have been well established, such as Lie algebra,\nSymplectic manifold, Poisson brackets, and others. However, mathematically, to\nfind out a general Hamilton function is very difficult even for very simple\nproblems. Inspired by these abstract mathematic researches, the Hamilton\ndynamic system is studied by geometrical field theory of deformation. Firstly,\nreferring to the instant configuration, the deformation tensor in spatial\ndomain and the velocity transformation tensor in time domain are established\nfor a dynamic system defined by a set of general velocity functions. Secondly,\nthe general deformation tensor in velocity space domain is obtained. From\ncontinuum mechanics point, the stress tensor is defined through introducing\nbackground feature of space. Then, the general motion equations are\nestablished. Based on them, the simple motions are divided into two classes: 1)\nstable motion; and 2) radiating motion. Both of them have quantum solution\nstructures. The features of space-time continuum are studied to obtain some\nintrinsic understanding about basic physical facts.

(2008), made in a lobe further from the star,\nwhich was based on a much longer time span. The pattern of proper motion\nvectors is mostly radial and the origin is close to the position of the central\nstar directly detected by Szyszka et al. (2009). The results show that the\nlobes of NGC 6302 were ejected during a brief event 2250 \\pm 35yr ago. In the\ninner regions there is evidence for a subsequent acceleration of the gas by an\nadditional 9.2 km/s, possibly related to the onset of ionization. The dense and\nmassive molecular torus was ejected over 5000yr, ending about 2900yr ago. The\nlobes were ejected after a short interlude (the 'jet lag') of \\sim 600 yr\nduring a brief event. The torus and lobes orig- inate from separate mass-loss\nevents with different physical processes. The delay between the cessation of\nequatorial mass loss and the ejection of the lobes provides an important\nconstraint for explaining the final mass-loss stages of the progenitor stellar\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2011 14:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Namely, I studied the cut-off shape of the Crab pulsar spectrum to\ndistinguish between the leading scenarios for the pulsar models.\n  Pulsars are celestial objects, which emit periodic pulsed electromagnetic\nradiation (pulsation) from radio to high energy gamma-rays. Two major scenarios\nevolved in past 40 years to explain the pulsation mechanism: the inner\nmagnetosphere scenario and the outer magnetosphere scenario. Both scenarios\npredict a high energy cut-off in the gamma-ray energy spectrum, but with\ndifferent cut-off sharpness. An exponential cut-off is expected for the outer\nmagnetosphere scenario while a super-exponential cut-off is predicted for the\ninner magnetosphere scenario. Therefore, one of the best ways to confirm or\nrule out these scenarios is to measure the energy spectrum of a pulsar at\naround the cut-off energy, i.e., at energies between a few GeV and a few tens\nof GeV. All past attempts (>10) to measure pulsars with ground-based\ninstruments have failed while satellite-borne detectors had a too small area to\nstudy detailed spectra in the GeV domain.\n  In this thesis, the gamma-ray emission at around the cut-off energy from the\nCrab pulsar is studied with the MAGIC telescope.

The model is based on the balance\nequation for the momentum flux, averaged over the wave-field ensemble, which\ntakes place in the wave-zone located between troughs and crests of waves.\nDerivation of the balance equation is presented, and the following main\nfeatures of the model are formulated. First, the total momentum flux includes\nonly two physically different types of components: the \"wave\" part TAUw\nassociated with the energy transfer to waves, and the \"tangential\" part TAUt\nthat does not provide such transfer. Second, component TAUw is split into two\nconstituents having different mathematical representation: (a) for the\nlow-frequency (energy-containing) part of the wave spectrum, the analytical\nexpression of momentum flux TAUw is given directly via the local wind at the\nstandard horizon, W; (b) for the high-frequency part of the wave spectrum, flux\nTAUw is determined by friction velocity u*. Third, the tangential component of\nthe momentum flux TAUt is parameterized by using the similarity theory,\nassuming that the wave-zone is an analogue of the traditional friction layer,\nand in this zone the constant eddy viscosity is realized, inherent to the wave\nstate. The constructed model was verified on the basis of simultaneous\nmeasurements of two-dimensional wave spectrum S and friction velocity u*, done\nfor a series of fixed values of W.

To date, only a simplified\nversion of physical-layer network coding (PNC) method, called analog network\ncoding (ANC), has been successfully implemented. The advantage of ANC is that\nit is simple to implement; the disadvantage, on the other hand, is that the\nrelay amplifies the noise along with the signal before forwarding the signal.\nPNC systems in which the relay performs XOR or other denoising PNC mappings of\nthe received signal have the potential for significantly better performance.\nHowever, the implementation of such PNC systems poses many challenges. For\nexample, the relay must be able to deal with symbol and carrier-phase\nasynchronies of the simultaneous signals received from the two end nodes, and\nthe relay must perform channel estimation before detecting the signals. We\ninvestigate a PNC implementation in the frequency domain, referred to as FPNC,\nto tackle these challenges. FPNC is based on OFDM. In FPNC, XOR mapping is\nperformed on the OFDM samples in each subcarrier rather than on the samples in\nthe time domain. We implement FPNC on the universal soft radio peripheral\n(USRP) platform. Our implementation requires only moderate modifications of the\npacket preamble design of 802.11a/g OFDM PHY. With the help of the cyclic\nprefix (CP) in OFDM, symbol asynchrony and the multi-path fading effects can be\ndealt with in a similar fashion.
