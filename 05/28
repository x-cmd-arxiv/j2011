Several models have been\nproposed to study the turbulent flame speed, such as the G-equations, the\nF-equations (Majda-Souganidis model) and reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA)\nequations. In the first part of this paper, we show that flow induced strain\nreduces front speeds of G-equations in periodic compressible and shear flows.\nThe F-equations arise in asymptotic analysis of reaction-diffusion-advection\nequations and are quadratically nonlinear analogues of the G-equations. In the\nsecond part of the paper, we compare asymptotic growth rates of the turbulent\nflame speeds from the G-equations, the F-equations and the RDA equations in the\nlarge amplitude ($A$) regime of spatially periodic flows. The F and G equations\nshare the same asymptotic front speed growth rate; in particular, the same\nsublinear growth law $A\\over \\log(A)$ holds in cellular flows. Moreover, in two\nspace dimensions, if one of these three models (G-equation, F-equation and the\nRDA equation) predicts the bending effect (sublinear growth in the large flow),\nso will the other two. The nonoccurrence of speed bending is characterized by\nthe existence of periodic orbits on the torus and the property of their\nrotation vectors in the advective flow fields. The cat's eye flow is discussed\nas a typical example of directional dependence of the front speed bending.

If\nwe attempt to bring the system back to infinity for observation, then\nacceleration radiation destroys the information. All three considerations give\na critical distance from the horizon $d\\sim \\sqrt{r_H\\over \\Delta E}$, where\n$r_H$ is the horizon radius and $\\Delta E$ is the energy scale characterizing\nthe system. For systems in string theory where we pack information as densely\nas possible, this acceleration constraint is found to have a geometric\ninterpretation. These estimates suggest that in theories of gravity we should\nmeasure information not as a quantity contained inside a given system, but in\nterms of how much of that information can be reliably accessed by another\nobserver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 17:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The main goal is to\ninvestigate possible mechanisms to explain the observed dichotomy in radial\nstellar metallicity profiles of dwarf galaxies: dwarf irregulars (dIrr) and\nflat, rotating dwarf ellipticals (dE) generally possess flat metallicity\nprofiles, while rounder and non-rotating dEs show strong negative metallicity\ngradients. These simulations show that flattening by rotation is key to\nreproducing the observed characteristics of flat dwarf galaxies, proving\nparticularly efficient in erasing metallicity gradients. We propose a\n\"centrifugal barrier mechanism\" as an alternative to the previously suggested\n\"fountain mechanism\" for explaining the flat metallicity profiles of dIrrs and\nflat, rotating dEs. While only flattening the dark-matter halo has little\ninfluence, the addition of angular momentum slows down the infall of gas, so\nthat star formation (SF) and the ensuing feedback are less centrally\nconcentrated, occurring galaxy-wide. Additionally, this leads to more\ncontinuous SFHs by preventing large-scale oscillations in the SFR\n(\"breathing\"), and creates low density holes in the ISM, in agreement with\nobservations of dIrrs. Our general conclusion is that rotation has a\nsignificant influence on the evolution and appearance of dwarf galaxies, and we\nsuggest angular momentum as a second parameter (after galaxy mass as the\ndominant parameter) in dwarf galaxy evolution. Angular momentum differentiates\nbetween SF modes, making our fast rotating models qualitatively resemble dIrrs,\nwhich does not seem possible without rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 19:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We apply this method to infer the\nnumber of mergers during the evolution of MUSYC early-type galaxies (ETGs) from\nz~1 to the present-day. Methods: The method consists in using clustering\ninformation to infer the typical dark-matter halo mass of the hosts of the\nselected progenitor galaxies. Using LambdaCDM predictions, it is then possible\nto follow these haloes to a later time where the sample of descendants will be\nthat with the clustering of these descendant haloes. Results: This technique\nshows that ETGs at a given redshift evolve into brighter galaxies at lower\nredshifts (considering rest-frame, passively evolved optical luminosities).\nThis indicates that the stellar mass of these galaxies increases with time and\nthat, in principle, a stellar mass selection at different redshifts does not\nprovide samples of galaxies in a progenitor-descendant relationship.\nConclusions: The comparison between high redshift ETGs and their likely\ndescendants at z=0 points to a higher number density for the progenitors by a\nfactor 5.5+-4.0, implying the need for mergers to decrease their number density\nby today. Because the luminosity densities of progenitors and descendants are\nconsistent, our results show no need for significant star-formation in ETGs\nsince z=1, which indicates that the needed mergers are dry, i.e. gas free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We use this\nto constrain the mass assembly history of two apparently relaxed nearby\nEarly-Type Galaxies (ETGs) selected from the Atlas-3D sample, NGC 680 and NGC\n5557. Our ultra deep optical images obtained with MegaCam on the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope reach 29 mag/arcsec^2 in the g-band. They reveal\nvery low-surface brightness (LSB) filamentary structures around these\nellipticals. Among them, a gigantic 160 kpc long tail East of NGC 5557 hosts\ngas-rich star-forming objects. NGC 680 exhibits two major diffuse plumes\napparently connected to extended HI tails, as well as a series of arcs and\nshells. Comparing the outer stellar and gaseous morphology of the two\nellipticals with that predicted from models of colliding galaxies, we argue\nthat the LSB features are tidal debris, the star-forming objects near NGC 5557,\nlong lived Tidal Dwarf Galaxies and that each of the two ETGs was assembled\nduring a relatively recent, major wet merger, which likely occurred at a\nredshift below z = 0.5. The inner kinematics of NGC 680 is typical for fast\nrotators which make the bulk of nearby ETGs in the Atlas-3D sample. NGC 5557\nbelongs to the poorly populated class of massive, round, slow rotators that are\npredicted by semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations to be the\nend-product of a complex mass accretion history, involving ancient major\nmergers and more recent minor mergers. Our observations suggest that under\nspecific circumstances a single binary merger may dominate the formation\nhistory of such objects and thus that at least some massive ETGs may form at\nrelatively low redshift (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 20:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In this paper, we follow the path set out by Jaynes, including elements\nadded subsequently to that original work, to explore the consequences of the\npurely statistical point of view. We show how standard methods in the\nequilibrium theory could have been derived simply from a description of the\navailable problem information. In addition, our presentation leads to novel\ninsights into questions associated with symmetry and non-equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics. Two surprising consequences to be explored in further\nwork are that (in)distinguishability factors are automatically predicted from\nthe problem formulation and that a quantity related to the thermodynamic\nentropy production is found by considering information loss in non-equilibrium\nprocesses. Using the problem of ion channel thermodynamics as an example, we\nillustrate the idea of building up complexity by successively adding\ninformation to create progressively more complex descriptions of a physical\nsystem. Our result is that such statistical mechanical descriptions can be used\nto create transparent, computable, experimentally-relevant models that may be\ninformed by more detailed atomistic simulations. We also derive a theory for\nthe kinetic behavior of this system, identifying the nonequilibrium `process'\nfree energy functional. The Gibbs relation for this functional is a\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem applicable arbitrarily far from equilibrium,\nthat captures the effect of non-local and time-dependent behavior from\ntransient driving forces.

Each channel has two states,\nnamely, the 'good' and 'bad' states. In the 'bad' state, the channel is assumed\nto be in deep fade and the transmission fails with probability one, while in\nthe 'good' state, there is some positive success probability. We calculate the\nStability region with and without Multipacket Reception capability as well as\nthe average delay without MPR. Our results show that the stability region of\nthe controlled S-ALOHA is always a superset of the stability region of\nuncontrolled S-ALOHA. Moreover, if the channel tends to be in the 'bad' state\nfor long proportion of time, then the stability region is a convex Polyhedron\nstrictly containing the TDMA stability region and the optimal transmission\nstrategy is to transmit with probability one whenever the nodes have packets\nand it is shown that this strategy is delay optimal. On the other hand, if the\nchannel tends to be in the 'good' state more often, then the stability region\nis bounded by a convex curve and is strict subset of the TDMA stability region.\nWe also show that enhancing the physical layer by allowing MPR capability can\nsignificantly enhance the performance while simplifying the MAC Layer design by\nthe lack of the need of scheduling under some conditions. Furthermore, it is\nshown that transmission control not only allows handling higher stable arrival\nrates but also leads to lower delay for the same arrival rate compared with\nordinary S-ALOHA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2011 00:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2011 01:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-14"}

Surveys of older clusters (age >100 Myr) are not affected\nso severely by several problems encountered in young clusters, such as\nintra-cluster extinction and large uncertainties in brown dwarf models. We\npresent the results of a deep photometric survey to study the MF of the central\nregion of the old open cluster Praesepe (age~590$^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr, distance\n~190$^{+6.0}_{-5.8}$ pc), down to the substellar regime. We performed an\noptical ($riz$ and $Y$-band) photometric survey of Praesepe using the Large\nBinocular Telescope Camera covering an area of ~0.59 deg$^2$ in the cluster\ncentre from $i$~19.0 mag (~100 M_Jup) down to a 5$\\sigma$ detection limit at\n$i$~25.6mag (~40 M_Jup). The survey is approximately 95% complete at $i=23.8$\nmag and $z=22.0$ mag (~55 M_Jup). We identify 59 cluster member candidates, of\nwhich 37 are substellar, by comparing with the predictions of a dusty\natmosphere model. The MF of those candidates rises from the substellar boundary\nuntil ~67 M_Jup and then declines. This is quite different from the form\ninferred for other open clusters older than 50 Myr, but seems to be similar to\nthose found in very young open clusters, the MFs of which peak at ~10 M_Jup.\nEither Praesepe really does have a different MF from other clusters or they had\nsimilar initial MFs but a different dynamical evolution. Since most of the\ncandidates are faint, we lack astrometric or spectroscopic follow-ups to test\ntheir memberships.

Extremal importance\nof unitary disjointness of $N$-tuples and the way how it `tidies up' the\nstructure of $CDD_N$ are emphasized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2011 11:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-03"}

In order to give the neural network description of\nresource leveling problem, a new description method called Augmented permute\nmatrix is proposed by expending the ability of the traditional one. An Embedded\nHybrid Model combining Hopfield model and SA are put forward to improve the\noptimization in essence in which Hopfield servers as State Generator for the\nSA. The experiment results show that Augmented permute matrix is able to\ncompletely and appropriately describe the application. The energy function and\nhybrid model given in this study are also highly efficient in solving resource\nleveling problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2011 00:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-13"}
