We implement the no-double\noccupancy constraint with a (semionic) slave-particle formalism. The dopant\ngenerates a vortex-like quantum distortion of the AF background centered on the\nempty sites, with opposite chirality for cores on the two N\\'eel sublattices.\nEmpty sites are described in terms of spinless fermionic holons and the\nlong-range attraction between spin vortices on two opposite N\\'eel sublattices\nis the holon pairing force, leading eventually to SC. The spin fluctuations are\ndescribed by bosonic spinons with a gap generated by scattering on spin\nvortices. Due to the occupation constraint, there is a gauge attraction between\nholon and spinon, binding them into a physical hole. Through gauge interaction\nthe spin vortex attraction induces the formation of spin-singlet RVB pairs\nreducing the spinon gap. Lowering T, there are two crossovers as precursors of\nthe SC transition: at the higher one a gas of holon pairs appears, reducing the\nhole spectral weight, while at the lower one a gas of spinon pairs also\nappears, giving rise to a gas of incoherent preformed hole pairs with magnetic\nvortices in the plasma phase, supporting a Nernst signal. At an even lower T\nthe hole pairs become coherent and SC appears beyond a critical doping. The\nproposed SC mechanism is not of the BCS-type, because it involves a gain in\nkinetic energy (lowering of spinon gap) and it is \"almost\" of the classical 3D\nXY-type. Since both the spinon gap and the holon pairing originate from the\nsame term in the slave-particle representation of the t-J model, this approach\nincorporates a strong interplay between AF and SC, giving rise to a universal\nrelation between Tc and the energy of the resonance mode, as observed in\nneutron scattering experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 16:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We\ninvestigate a generalized Bianchi type I anisotropic cosmology in 5D BD theory,\nand by employing obtained formalism, we derive induced-matter on any 4D\nhypersurface in context of the MBDT. We illustrate that if the usual spatial\nscale factors are functions of time while scale factor of extra dimension is\nconstant, and scalar field depends on time and fifth coordinate, then in\ngeneral, one will encounter inconsistencies in field equations. Then, we assume\nthe scale factors and scalar field depend on time and extra coordinate as\nseparated variables in power law forms. Hence, we find a few classes of\nsolutions in 5D spacetime through which, we probe the one which leads to a\ngeneralized Kasner relations among Kasner parameters. The induced scalar\npotential is found to be in power law or in logarithmic form, however, for\nconstant scaler field and even when scalar field only depends on fifth\ncoordinate, it vanishes. The conservation law is indeed valid in this MBDT\napproach for derived induced energy momentum tensor (EMT). We proceed our\ninvestigations for a few cosmological quantities, where for simplicity we\nassume metric and scalar field are functions of time. Hence, the EMT satisfies\nbarotropic equation of state, and the model indicates that constant mean Hubble\nparameter is not allowed. Thus, by appealing to variation of Hubble parameter,\nwe assume a fixed deceleration parameter, and set evolution of quantities with\nrespect to the fixed deceleration, BD coupling and state parameters.

The most novel part of this paper is to use open-closed\nGromov-Witten theory (operator $\\frak q$ in [FOOO1] and its variant involving\nclosed orbits of periodic Hamiltonian system) to connect spectral invariants\n(with bulk deformation), symplectic quasi-states, quasimorphism to the\nLagrangian Floer theory (with bulk deformation). We use this open-closed\nGromov-Witten theory to produce new examples. Especially using the calculation\nof Lagrangian Floer homology with bulk deformation in [FOOO3,FOOO4], we produce\nexamples of compact toric manifolds $(M,\\omega)$ which admits uncountably many\nindependent quasimorphisms $\\widetilde{\\operatorname{Ham}}(M,\\omega) \\to\n\\mathbb R$. We also obtain a new intersection result of Lagrangian submanifolds\non $S^2 \\times S^2$ discovered in [FOOO6]. Many of these applications were\nannounced in [FOOO3,FOOO4,FOOO6].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 19:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 15:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 00:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

In this paper\nwe apply the available prompt optical emission data (both detections and upper\nlimits) to constrain such a scenario. We fit the shallow and normal decay\nsegments of the XRT light curves in our sample with a T_\\Delta-shifted single\npower law, and extrapolate the X-ray flux back to the time of the early optical\nobservations. We then use the synchrotron spectrum predicted by the standard\nexternal shock model to extrapolate from the X-ray flux to the optical band,\nand obtain the possible range of the predicted optical flux. Finally, we\ncompare the predictions with the observations. In the cases where later optical\ndata are available, we also compare the shapes of the optical light curves to\nthe predicted optical light curves from the external shock prior emission\nmodel. We find that for a good fraction of GRBs (4 out of 8; up to December\n2006), the available data already impose severe constraints on the hypothesis.\nIn particular, the expected optical flux from the prior external shock model is\nhigher than what the data allow. We conclude that if the shallow-decay X-ray\ncomponent were from a prior emission component, it would have to be of an\ninternal origin with optical flux suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 19:48:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 01:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

It's power spectrum is a sensitive\nprobe of the density fluctuations, and the bispectrum can be used to separate\nthe bias associated with pressure. The bispectrum is often probed with a\none-point real-space analogue, the skewness. In addition to the skewness the\nmorphological properties, as probed by the well known Minkowski Functionals\n(MFs), also require the generalized one-point statistics, which at the lowest\norder are identical to the skewness parameters. The concept of generalized\nskewness parameters can be extended to define a set of three associated\ngeneralized skew-spectra. We use these skew-spectra to probe the morphology of\nthe tSZ sky or the y-sky. We show how these power spectra can be recovered from\nthe data in the presence of arbitrary mask and noise templates using the well\nknown Pseudo-Cl (PCL) approach for arbitrary beam shape.

We consider the performance of an all-sky survey with Planck-type\nnoise and compare the results against a noise-free ideal experiment using a\nrange of smoothing angles. We find that the skew-spectra can be estimated with\nvery high signal-to-noise ratio from future frequency cleaned tSZ maps that\nwill be available from experiments such as Planck. This will allow their mode\nby mode estimation for a wide range of angular frequencies and will help us to\ndifferentiate them from various other sources of non-Gaussianity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-11"}

In simulations of the\nformation of the first stars, it has been shown that, due to the limited\nability of metal-free primordial gas to cool, the IMF of the first stars is a\nfew orders of magnitude more massive than the current IMF. The transition from\na high-mass IMF of the first stars to a lower-mass current IMF is thus\nimportant to understand. To study the underlying physics of this transition, we\nperformed several simulations using the cosmological hydrodynamic adaptive mesh\nrefinement code Enzo for metallicities of 10^{-4}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-2}, and\n10^{-1} Z_{\\odot}. In our simulations we include a star formation prescription\nthat is derived from a metallicity dependent multi-phase ISM structure, an\nexternal UV radiation field, and a mechanical feedback algorithm. We also\nimplement cosmic ray heating, photoelectric heating and gas-dust\nheating/cooling, and follow the metal enrichment of the ISM. It is found that\nthe interplay between metallicity and UV radiation leads to the co-existence of\nPop III and Pop II star formation in non-zero metallicity (Z/Z_{\\odot}\n\\geq10^{-2}) gas. A cold (T<100 K) and dense (\\rho>10^{-22} g cm^{-3}) gas\nphase is fragile to ambient UV radiation. In a metal-poor (Z/Z_{\\odot}\n\\leq10^{-3}) gas, the cold and dense gas phase does not form in the presence of\na radiation field of F_{0}\\sim10^{-5}-10^{-4} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. Therefore,\nmetallicity by itself is not a good indicator of the Pop III-Pop II transition.\nMetal-rich (Z/Z_{\\odot}\\geq10^{-2}) gas dynamically evolves two to three orders\nof magnitude faster than metal poor gas (Z/Z_{\\odot}\\leq10^{-3}).

In the Bose-Einstein\nCondensation model, dark matter can be described as a non-relativistic,\nNewtonian gravitational condensate, whose density and pressure are related by a\nbarotropic equation of state, with barotropic index equal to one. In the\npresent work, we study the Bose-Einstein Condensation process in a cosmological\ncontext, by assuming that this process can be described (at least\napproximately) as a first order phase transition. We analyze the evolution of\nthe physical quantities relevant for the physical description of the early\nuniverse, namely, the energy density, temperature and scale factor, before,\nduring and after the Bose-Einstein Condensation (phase transition). We also\nconsider in detail the epoch when the universe evolved through a mixed\ncondensate - normal dark matter phase, with a monotonically growing\nBose-Einstein dark matter component. An important parameter characterizing the\nBose-Einstein Condensation is the condensate dark matter fraction, whose time\nevolution describes the time dynamics of the conversion process. The behavior\nof this parameter during the cosmological condensation process is also analyzed\nin detail. To study the cosmological dynamics and evolution we use both\nanalytical and numerical methods. The presence of the condensate dark matter\nand of the Bose-Einstein phase transition could have modified drastically the\ncosmological evolution of the early universe, as well as the large scale\nstructure formation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 01:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

This result is surprising as it says that there is no\npenalty for not knowing the support region of the spreading function prior to\nidentification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 06:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We attend\nto a scenario where some of the routers are anonymous, and propose two\nfundamental axioms that model two basic assumptions on the traceroute data: (1)\neach trace corresponds to a real path in the network, and (2) the routing paths\nare at most a factor 1/alpha off the shortest paths, for some parameter alpha\nin (0,1]. In contrast to existing literature that focuses on the cardinality of\nthe set of (often only minimal) inferrable topologies, we argue that a large\nnumber of possible topologies alone is often unproblematic, as long as the\nnetworks have a similar structure. We hence seek to characterize the set of\ntopologies inferred with our axioms. We introduce the notion of star graphs\nwhose colorings capture the differences among inferred topologies; it also\nallows us to construct inferred topologies explicitly. We find that in general,\ninferrable topologies can differ significantly in many important aspects, such\nas the nodes' distances or the number of triangles. These negative results are\ncomplemented by a discussion of a scenario where the trace set is best\npossible, i.e., \"complete\".

In this paper, we show the effect of metallicity on the DTD\nof SNe Ia from single-degenerate models (including WD + MS and WD+RG channels).\nVia a binary population synthesis approach, we find that the DTD from a low\nmetallicity population is significantly delayed compared with that from a high\nmetallicity one.

These basins were\ndiscovered during the first and third MESSENGER flybys of Mercury,\nrespectively. One of the most interesting features of both basins is their\nrelatively fresh appearance. The young age of both basins is confirmed by our\nanalysis on the basis of age determination via crater chronology. The derived\nRachmaninoff and Raditladi basin model ages are about 3.6 Ga and 1.1 Ga,\nrespectively. Moreover, we also constrain the age of the smooth plains within\nthe basins' floors. This analysis shows that Mercury had volcanic activity\nuntil recent time, possibly to about 1 Ga or less. We find that some of the\ncrater size-frequency distributions investigated suggest the presence of a\nlayered target. Therefore, within this work we address the importance of\nconsidering terrain parameters, as geo-mechanical properties and layering, into\nthe process of age determination. We also comment on the likelihood of the\navailability of impactors able to form basins with the sizes of Rachmaninoff\nand Raditladi in relatively recent times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 16:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Each pair of particles occupying neighboring sites has a negative\nbinding energy provided their types are different, while each particle has a\npositive activation energy that depends on its type. There is no binding energy\nbetween particles of the same type. At the boundary of the box particles are\ncreated and annihilated in a way that represents the presence of an infinite\ngas reservoir. We start the dynamics from the empty box and are interested in\nthe transition time to the full box. This transition is triggered by a critical\ndroplet appearing somewhere in the box. In the first paper we identified the\nparameter range for which the system is metastable, showed that the first\nentrance distribution on the set of critical droplets is uniform, computed the\nexpected transition time up to and including a multiplicative factor of order\none, and proved that the nucleation time divided by its expectation is\nexponentially distributed, all in the limit of low temperature. These results\nwere proved under three hypotheses, and involve three model-dependent\nquantities: the energy, the shape and the number of critical droplets. In this\nsecond paper we prove the first and the second hypothesis and identify the\nenergy of critical droplets. The paper deals with understanding the geometric\nproperties of subcritical, critical and supercritical droplets, which are\ncrucial in determining the metastable behavior of the system. The geometry\nturns out to be considerably more complex than for Kawasaki dynamics with one\ntype of particle, for which an extensive literature exists. The main motivation\nbehind our work is to understand metastability of multi- type particle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 13:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

An inner bound on the GDOF is derived using a combination of\ntechniques such as treating interference as noise, zero forcing (ZF) at the\nreceivers, interference alignment (IA), and extending the Han-Kobayashi (HK)\nscheme to K users, as a function of the number of antennas and the log (INR) /\nlog (SNR) level. Three outer bounds are derived, under different assumptions of\ncooperation and providing side information to receivers. The novelty in the\nderivation lies in the careful selection of side information, which results in\nthe cancellation of the negative differential entropy terms containing signal\ncomponents, leading to a tractable outer bound. The overall outer bound is\nobtained by taking the minimum of the three outer bounds. The derived bounds\nare simplified for the MIMO Gaussian symmetric IC to obtain outer bounds on the\ngeneralized degrees of freedom (GDOF). Several interesting conclusions are\ndrawn from the derived bounds. For example, when K > N/M + 1, a combination of\nthe HK and IA schemes performs the best among the schemes considered. When N/M\n< K <= N/M + 1, the HK-scheme outperforms other schemes and is shown to be GDOF\noptimal.

This halo or torus is located within a few AU of the\nstar, but its origin has not yet been understood. A dynamically excited cloud\nof planetesimals colliding to eventually form dust could produce such a\nstructure. The cause of the dynamical excitation could be one or more planets.\nThis work investigates an inwardly migrating planet that is dynamically\nscattering planetesimals as a possible cause for the observed structures. If\nthis mechanism is responsible, the observed halo-like structure could be used\nto infer the existence of planets in these systems. We present analytical\nestimates on the maximum inclination reached owing to dynamical interactions\nbetween planetesimals and a migrating planet. A symplectic integrator is used\nto simulate the effect of a migrating planet on a population of planetesimals.\nIt is found that an inwardly migrating planet is only able to scatter the\nmaterial it encounters to highly-inclined orbits if the material is on an\neccentric orbit. Such eccentric orbits can be the result of resonance trapping\nand eccentricity pumping. Simulations show that for a certain range of\nmigration rates and planet masses, resonance capture combined with planetary\nmigration indeed causes the planetesimals to reach eccentric orbits and\nsubsequently get scattered to highly-inclined orbits. The size distribution of\nthe resulting dust is calculated determined to find the total mass and optical\ndepth, which are found to compare reasonably well with the observed structures.\nDynamical scattering of planetesimals caused by a planet migrating in, followed\nby the grinding down of these planetesimals to dust grains, appears to be a\npromising explanation for the inferred circumstellar dust clouds. Further study\nis needed to see if the haloes can be used to infer the presence of planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 15:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
