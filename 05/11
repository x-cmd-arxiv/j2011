These\ninclude the halo mass function, halo merger rates, halo formation times and\nmasses, halo clustering, analogous quantities for voids, and the distribution\nof dark matter counts in randomly placed cells. The approach assumes that all\nthese quantities can be mapped to problems involving the first crossing\ndistribution of a suitably chosen barrier by random walks. Most analytic\nexpressions for these distributions ignore the fact that, although different\nk-modes in the initial Gaussian field are uncorrelated, this is not true in\nreal space: the values of the density field at a given spatial position, when\nsmoothed on different real-space scales, are correlated in a nontrivial way. As\na result, the problem is to estimate first crossing distribution by random\nwalks having correlated rather than uncorrelated steps. In 1990, Peacock &\nHeavens presented a simple approximation for the first crossing distribution of\na single barrier of constant height by walks with correlated steps. We show\nthat their approximation can be thought of as a correction to the distribution\nassociated with what we call smooth completely correlated walks. We then use\nthis insight to extend their approach to treat moving barriers, as well as\nwalks that are constrained to pass through a certain point before crossing the\nbarrier. For the latter, we show that a simple rescaling, inspired by bivariate\nGaussian statistics, of the unconditional first crossing distribution,\naccurately describes the conditional distribution, independently of the choice\nof analytical prescription for the former.

However, the light field emitted by a single atom can exhibit\nmuch richer dynamics. A prominent example is the predicted ability for a single\natom to produce quadrature-squeezed light, with sub-shot-noise amplitude or\nphase fluctuations. It has long been foreseen, though, that such squeezing\nwould be \"at least an order of magnitude more difficult\" to observe than the\nemission of single photons. Squeezed beams have been generated using\nmacroscopic and mesoscopic media down to a few tens of atoms, but despite\nexperimental efforts, single-atom squeezing has so far escaped observation.\nHere we generate squeezed light with a single atom in a high-finesse optical\nresonator. The strong coupling of the atom to the cavity field induces a\ngenuine quantum mechanical nonlinearity, several orders of magnitude larger\nthan for usual macroscopic media. This produces observable quadrature squeezing\nwith an excitation beam containing on average only two photons per system\nlifetime. In sharp contrast to the emission of single photons, the squeezed\nlight stems from the quantum coherence of photon pairs emitted from the system.\nThe ability of a single atom to induce strong coherent interactions between\npropagating photons opens up new perspectives for photonic quantum logic with\nsingle emitters\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 17:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 10:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-28"}

In particular, we give a $(1.5 - 1/k)$-approximation for the\nhypergraph multiway partition problem. We also give a $\\min\\{2(1-1/k),\nH_{\\Delta}\\}$-approximation for the hypergraph multiway cut problem when\n$\\Delta$ is the maximum hyperedge size. Both problems generalize the multiway\ncut problem in graphs and the hypergraph cut problem is approximation\nequivalent to the node-weighted multiway cut problem in graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 20:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

The demand that nature be rational, in\nthe sense that it be compatible with the principle of sufficient reason,\nconflicts with a basic feature of contemporary orthodox physical theory, namely\nthe notion that nature's response to the probing action of an observer is\ndetermined by pure chance, and hence on the basis of absolutely no reason at\nall. This appeal to pure chance can be deemed to have no rational fundamental\nplace in reason-based Western science. It is argued here, on the basis of the\nother basic principles of quantum physics, that in a world that conforms to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, the usual quantum statistical rules will\nnaturally emerge at the pragmatic level, in cases where the reason behind\nnature's choice of response is unknown, but that the usual statistics can\nbecome biased in an empirically manifest way when the reason for the choice is\nempirically identifiable.

Furthermore, our\nresults show that the magnitude of the giant exciton splittings, specific to\ndilute magnetic semiconductors, is unusual: the magnetoreflectivity data is\ndescribed by an effective exchange energy N_0(beta-alpha)=+0.2+/-0.1 eV, what\npoints to small and positive N_0 beta.

Besides providing UV completeness, the\nphenomenology of these models is richer than vanilla large-dimensional models\nin several ways: (i) they are supersymmetric, with SUSY broken at sub-eV scales\nin the bulk but only nonlinearly realised in the SM sector, leading to no MSSM\nsuperpartners and many more bulk missing-energy channels, as in supersymmetric\nlarge extra dimensions (SLED); (ii) small cycles in the complicated\nextra-dimensional geometry allow some KK states to reside at TeV scales even if\nall 6 EDs are much larger; (iii) a rich spectrum of string and KK states at TeV\nscales; and (iv) an equally rich spectrum of light moduli having unusually\nsmall (but technically natural) masses, with potentially interesting\nimplications for cosmology and astrophysics that nonetheless evade new-force\nconstraints.

In the absence of the magnetic field,\nthe phase diagram is divided into four gapped regions. To determine what\nhappens by applying a transverse magnetic field, using the spinless fermion\napproach, critical fields are obtained as a function of exchanges. Our\nanalytical results show, the field-induced effects depend on in which one of\nthe four regions the system is. In two regions of the phase diagram, the\nIsing-type phase transition happens in a finite field. In another region, we\nhave identified two quantum phase transitions in the ground state magnetic\nphase diagram. These quantum phase transitions belong to the universality class\nof the commensurate-incommensurate phase transition.

Yet, even successful modeling approaches such as those inspired by\nNewtonian force models are still not fully consistent with empirical\nobservations and are sometimes hard to calibrate. Here, a novel cognitive\nscience approach is proposed, which is based on behavioral heuristics. We\nsuggest that, guided by visual information, namely the distance of obstructions\nin candidate lines of sight, pedestrians apply two simple cognitive procedures\nto adapt their walking speeds and directions. While simpler than previous\napproaches, this model predicts individual trajectories and collective patterns\nof motion in good quantitative agreement with a large variety of empirical and\nexperimental data. This includes the emergence of self-organization phenomena,\nsuch as the spontaneous formation of unidirectional lanes or stop-and-go waves.\nMoreover, the combination of pedestrian heuristics with body collisions\ngenerates crowd turbulence at extreme densities-a phenomenon that has been\nobserved during recent crowd disasters. By proposing an integrated treatment of\nsimultaneous interactions between multiple individuals, our approach overcomes\nlimitations of current physics-inspired pair interaction models. Understanding\ncrowd dynamics through cognitive heuristics is therefore not only crucial for a\nbetter preparation of safe mass events. It also clears the way for a more\nrealistic modeling of collective social behaviors, in particular of human\ncrowds and biological swarms. Furthermore, our behavioral heuristics may serve\nto improve the navigation of autonomous robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 10:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This paper\npresents an optimization framework that takes into account the information\ncollection (observation), estimation (regression), and optimization\n(maximization) aspects in a holistic and structured manner. Explicitly\nquantifying the information acquired at each optimization step using the\nentropy measure from information theory, the (nonconvex) objective function to\nbe optimized (maximized) is modeled and estimated by adopting a Bayesian\napproach and using Gaussian processes as a state-of-the-art regression method.\nThe resulting iterative scheme allows the decision maker to solve the problem\nby expressing preferences for each aspect quantitatively and concurrently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 13:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

This oscillation event had\na number of unusual features: (i) Excitation of kink-mode oscillations in\nvertical polarization (in the loop plane); (ii) Coupled cross-sectional and\ndensity oscillations with identical periods; (iii) no detectable kink amplitude\ndamping over the observed duration of four kink-mode periods ($P=6.3$ min);\n(iv) multi-loop oscillations with slightly ($\\approx 10%$) different periods;\nand (v) a relatively cool loop temperature of $T\\approx 0.5$ MK.

Methods: One\nimportant piece of information that has been neglected so far when determining\nthe evolutionary state is the presence of the radio-active s-process element\ntechnetium (Tc). We obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise-ratio\noptical spectra of a dozen prominent Mira variables with changing pulsation\nperiod to search for this indicator of TPs and dredge-up. We also use the\nspectra to measure lithium (Li) abundances. Furthermore, we establish the\nevolutionary states of our sample stars by means of their present-day periods\nand luminosities. Results: Among the twelve sample stars observed in this\nprogramme, five were found to show absorption lines of Tc. BH Cru is found to\nbe a carbon-star, its period increase in the past decades possibly having\nstopped by now. We report a possible switch in the pulsation mode of T UMi from\nMira-like to semi-regular variability in the past two years. R Nor, on the\nother hand, is probably a fairly massive AGB star, which could be true for all\nmeandering Miras. Finally, we assign RU Vul to the metal-poor thick disk with\nproperties very similar to the short-period, metal-poor Miras. Conclusions: We\nconclude that there is no clear correlation between period change class and Tc\npresence. The stars that are most likely to have experienced a recent TP are BH\nCru and R Hya, although their rates of period change are quite different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 14:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 16:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

High-level context information is typically obtained from context\nservices that aggregate raw context information sensed by various sensors and\nmobile devices. Given the massive amount of sensed data, traditional context\nservices are lacking the necessary resources to store and process these data,\nas well as to disseminate high-level context information to a variety of\npotential context consumers.

Moreover, we describe a\nmulti-attributes decision algorithm for the selection of potential context\nservices that can fulfill context consumers' requests for context information.\nThe algorithm calculates the score of each context service, per context\ninformation type, based on the quality-of-service (QoS) and quality-of-context\ninformation (QoC) requirements expressed by the context consumer. One of the\nbenefits of the approach is that context providers can scale up and down, in\nterms of cloud resources they use, depending on current demand for context\ninformation. Besides, the selection algorithm allows ranking context services\nby matching their QoS and QoC offers against the QoS and QoC requirements of\nthe context consumer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 18:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

We seek a comprehensive analysis of all the information provided by the\nXMM-Newton satellite of the four Seyfert 1 galaxies ESO 359-G19, HE 1143-1810,\nCTS A08.12, and Mrk 110, including the UV range, to characterize the different\ncomponents that are emitting and absorbing radiation in the vicinity of the\nactive nucleus.\n  Methods. The continuum emission was studied through the EPIC spectra by\ntaking advantage of the spectral range of these cameras. The high-resolution\nRGS spectra were analyzed to characterize the absorbing and emission line\nfeatures that arise in the spectra of the sources. All these data, complemented\nby information in the UV, are analyzed jointly in order to achieve a consistent\ncharacterization of the observed features in each object.\n  Results. The continuum emission of the sources can be characterized either by\na combination of a power law and a black body for the weakest objects or by two\npower law components for the brightest ones. The continuum is not absorbed by\nneutral or ionized material in the line of sight to any of these sources. In\nall of them we have identified a narrow Fe-Kalpha line at 6.4 keV. In ESO\n559-G19 we also find an FeXXVI line at about 7 keV. In the soft X-rays band, we\nidentify only one OVII line in the spectra of HE 1143-1810 and CTS A08.12, and\ntwo OVII-He alpha triplets and a narrow OVIII-Ly alpha emission line in Mrk\n110.\n  Conclusions. Not detecting warm material in the line of sight to the low\nstate objects is due to intrinsically weaker or absent absorption in the line\nof sight and not to a low signal-to-noise ratio in the data. Besides this, the\nabsence of clear emission lines cannot be fully attributed to dilution of those\nlines by a strong continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 15:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

In coalitional games without externalities, it allows\nto compute a unique payoff division that meets certain desirable fairness\naxioms. However, in many realistic applications where externalities are\npresent, Shapley's axioms fail to indicate such a unique division.\nConsequently, there are many extensions of Shapley value to the environment\nwith externalities proposed in the literature built upon additional axioms. Two\nimportant such extensions are \"externality-free\" value by Pham Do and Norde and\nvalue that \"absorbed all externalities\" by McQuillin. They are good reference\npoints in a space of potential payoff divisions for coalitional games with\nexternalities as they limit the space at two opposite extremes.

The\nmain motivation is to address the yet poorly understood size variation-induced\neffect on power-aware buffering schemes. Our theoretical analysis elucidates\nthe fundamental differences between the fixed-size and fixed-interval buffering\nschemes in the presence of data size variation. It shows that data size\nvariation has detrimental effects on the power expenditure of the fixed-size\nbuffering in general, and reveals that the size variation induced effects can\nbe either mitigated by a positive skewness or promoted by a negative skewness\nin size distribution. By contrast, the fixed-interval buffering scheme has an\nobvious advantage of being eminently immune to the data-size variation. Hence\nthe fixed-interval buffering scheme is a risk-averse strategy for its\nrobustness in a variety of operational environments.
