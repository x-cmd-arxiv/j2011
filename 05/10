In 3D, higher stability criteria, including two or more electrons,\nwere predicted to exponentially deplete the 1P-DOS at energies close enough to\nthe Fermi level.

We compare the outflow signatures in different types of ULIRGs\nand in starburst galaxies to address the issue of the energy source (AGN or\nstarburst) of these outflows. We report preliminary evidence that ULIRGs with a\nhigher AGN luminosity (and higher AGN contribution to L_IR) have higher\nterminal velocities and shorter gas depletion time scales.

HC_3N(5-4) line emission is found across the\nnuclear mini-spiral, but is very weak towards the starburst site, the location\nof the strongest mid-IR and radio emission. The J=16-15 and 10-9 lines are also\nfaint near the large HII region complex, but are brighter relative to the 5-4\nline, consistent with higher excitation. The brightest HC_3N emission is\nlocated in the northern arm of the nuclear minispiral, 100 pc away from the\nradio/IR source to the southwest of the nucleus. This location appears less\naffected by ultraviolet radiation, and may represent a more embedded, earlier\nstage of star formation. HC_3N excitation temperatures are consistent with\nthose determined from C^{18}O; the gas is dense, 10^{4-5}/cc, and cool, T_K ~<\n40 K. So as to not violate limits on the total H_2 mass determined from\nC^{18}O, at least two dense components are required to model IC 342's giant\nmolecular clouds. These observations suggest that HC_3N(5-4) is an excellent\nprobe of the dense, quiescent gas in galaxies. The high excitation combined\nwith faint emission towards the dense molecular gas at the starburst indicates\nthat it currently lacks large masses of very dense gas.

To overcome these difficulties,\neconomists have introduced an interesting distinction between 'risk' and\n'ambiguity' depending on the existence of a (classical Kolmogorovian)\nprobabilistic structure modeling these uncertainty situations. On the other\nhand, evidence of everyday life suggests that 'context' plays a fundamental\nrole in human decisions under uncertainty. Moreover, it is well known from\nphysics that any probabilistic structure modeling contextual interactions\nbetween entities structurally needs a non-Kolmogorovian quantum-like framework.\nIn this paper we introduce the notion of 'contextual risk' with the aim of\nmodeling a substantial part of the situations in which usually only 'ambiguity'\nis present. More precisely, we firstly introduce the essentials of an\noperational formalism called 'the hidden measurement approach' in which\nprobability is introduced as a consequence of fluctuations in the interaction\nbetween entities and contexts. Within the hidden measurement approach we\npropose a 'sphere model' as a mathematical tool for situations in which\ncontextual risk occurs. We show that a probabilistic model of this kind is\nnecessarily non-Kolmogorovian, hence it requires either the formalism of\nquantum mechanics or a generalization of it. This insight is relevant, for it\nexplains the presence of quantum or, better, quantum-like, structures in\neconomics, as suggested by some authors, and can serve to solve the\naforementioned paradoxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2011 22:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

In particular for some models LBP does not\nconverge, and in general when it does converge, the computed variances are\nincorrect (except for cycle-free graphs for which belief propagation (BP) is\nnon-iterative and exact). In this paper we propose {\\em feedback message\npassing} (FMP), a message-passing algorithm that makes use of a special set of\nvertices (called a {\\em feedback vertex set} or {\\em FVS}) whose removal\nresults in a cycle-free graph. In FMP, standard BP is employed several times on\nthe cycle-free subgraph excluding the FVS while a special message-passing\nscheme is used for the nodes in the FVS. The computational complexity of exact\ninference is $O(k^2n)$, where $k$ is the number of feedback nodes, and $n$ is\nthe total number of nodes. When the size of the FVS is very large, FMP is\nintractable. Hence we propose {\\em approximate FMP}, where a pseudo-FVS is used\ninstead of an FVS, and where inference in the non-cycle-free graph obtained by\nremoving the pseudo-FVS is carried out approximately using LBP. We show that,\nwhen approximate FMP converges, it yields exact means and variances on the\npseudo-FVS and exact means throughout the remainder of the graph. We also\nprovide theoretical results on the convergence and accuracy of approximate FMP.\nIn particular, we prove error bounds on variance computation. Based on these\ntheoretical results, we design efficient algorithms to select a pseudo-FVS of\nbounded size. The choice of the pseudo-FVS allows us to explicitly trade off\nbetween efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results show that using a\npseudo-FVS of size no larger than $\\log(n)$, this procedure converges much more\noften, more quickly, and provides more accurate results than LBP on the entire\ngraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 04:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

So far attention has been focused on $C^{1}$ models while in this\npaper we approach it a more general way, investigating the implications of\nhigher order central smoothness conditions for LTB models reproducing the\nluminosity distance of a $\\Lambda CDM$ Universe. Our analysis is based on a low\nred-shift expansion, and extends previous investigations by including also the\nconstraint coming from the age of the Universe and re-expressing the equations\nfor the solution of the inversion problem in a manifestly dimensionless form\nwhich makes evident the freedom to accommodate any value of $H_0$ as well,\ncorrecting some wrong claims that the observed value of $H_0$ would be enough\nto rule out LTB models.\n  Higher order smoothness conditions strongly limit the number of possible\nsolutions respect to the first order condition. Neither a $C^{1}$ or a $C^{i}$\nLTB model can both satisfy the age constraint and mimick the cosmological\nconstant for the luminosity distance. One difference is in the case in which\nthe age constraint is not included and the bang function is zero, in which\nthere is a unique solution for $C^1$ models but no solution for the $C^{i}$\ncase. Another difference is in the case in which the age constraint is not\nincluded and the bang function is not zero, in which the solution is\nundetermined for both $C^1$ and $C^{i}$ models, but the latter ones have much\nless residual parametric freedom.\n  Our results imply that any LTB model able to fit luminosity distance data and\nsatisfy the age constraint is either not mimicking exactly the $\\Lambda CDM$\nred-shift space observables theoretical predictions or it is not $C^{\\infty}$\nsmooth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 07:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 02:50:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 12:12:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 17:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

Let $E, F$ be two Banach spaces, $g: E\\rightarrow F$ a $c^1$ map\ndefined on an open set $U$ in $E,$ and the constraint $S=$ the preimage\n$g^{-1}(y_0), y_0\\in F.$ A main deference between the non regular constraint\nand regular constraint is that $g'(x)$ at any $x\\in S$ is not surjective.\nRecently, the critical point theory under the non regular constraint is a\nconcerned focus in optimization theory. The principle also suits the case of\nregular constraint. Coordinately, the generalized regular constraint is\nintroduced, and the critical point principle on generalized regular constraint\nis established. Let $f: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a nonlinear functional.\nWhile the Lagrange multiplier $L$ in classical critical point principle is\nconsidered, and its expression is given by using generalized inverse\n${g'}^+(x)$ of $g'(x)$ as follows : if $x\\in S$ is a critical point of $f|_S,$\nthen $L=f'(x)\\circ {g'}^+(x) \\in F^*.$ Moreover, it is proved that if $S$ is a\nregular constraint, then the Lagrange multiplier $L$ is unique; otherwise, $L$\nis ill-posed. Hence, in case of the non regular constraint, it is very\ndifficult to solve Euler equations, however, it is often the case in\noptimization theory. So the principle here seems to be new and applicable. By\nthe way, the following theorem is proved; if $A\\in B(E,F)$ is double split,\nthen the set of all generalized inverses of $A,$ $GI(A)$ is smooth\ndiffeomorphic to certain Banach space. This is a new and interesting result in\ngeneralized inverse analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 08:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 07:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-16"}

We find that\nthe evolution is illustrated by the two-step process described below: the\ninitial tube rises due to its buoyancy, subject to aerodynamic drag due to the\nexternal flow. Because of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field, the\ntube maintains its coherency and does not deform to become a vortex roll pair.\nWhen the flux tube approaches the photosphere and expands sufficiently, the\nplasma on the rising tube accumulates to suppress the tube's emergence.\nTherefore, the flux decelerates and extends horizontally beneath the surface.\nThis new finding owes to our large scale simulation calculating simultaneously\nthe dynamics within the interior as well as above the surface. As the magnetic\npressure gradient increases around the surface, magnetic buoyancy instability\nis triggered locally and, as a result, the flux rises further into the solar\ncorona. We also find that the deceleration occurs at a higher altitude than in\nour previous experiment using magnetic flux sheets (Toriumi and Yokoyama).

For the NLS equation with saturable nonlinearity, whose\nmodulation system does not possess Riemann invariants, we take advantage of the\nrecently developed method for the DSW description in non-integrable dispersive\nsystems to obtain main physical parameters of the DSW refraction. The key\nfeatures of the DSW-RW interaction predicted by our modulation theory analysis\nare confirmed by direct numerical solutions of the full dispersive problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 11:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 00:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Hence, the continuum intensity contrast of magnetic elements in the\nquiet Sun (QS) network and in active region (AR) plage is an essential quantity\nthat needs to be measured reliably. By using Hinode/SP disk center data at a\nconstant, high spatial resolution, we aim at updating results of earlier\nground-based studies of contrast vs. magnetogram signal, and to look for\nsystematic differences between AR plages and QS network. The field strength,\nfilling factor and inclination of the field was retrieved by Milne-Eddington\ninversion (VFISV). As in earlier studies, we performed a pixel-by-pixel study\nof 630.2 nm continuum contrast vs. apparent (i.e. averaged over a pixel)\nlongitudinal magnetic field over large fields of view in ARs and in the QS. The\ncontrast of magnetic elements reaches larger values in the QS (on average 3.7%)\nthan in ARs (1.3%). This could not be attributed to any systematic difference\nin the chosen contrast references. At Hinode's spatial resolution, the\nrelationship between contrast and apparent longitudinal field strength exhibits\na peak at around 700 G in both the QS and ARs, whereas earlier lower resolution\nstudies only found a peak in the QS and a monotonous decrease in ARs. We\nattribute this discrepancy both to our careful removal of the pores and their\nclose surroundings affected by the telescope diffraction, as well as to the\nenhanced spatial resolution and very low scattered light of the Hinode Solar\nOptical Telescope. According to our inversions, the magnetic elements producing\nthe peak of the contrast curves have similar properties (field strength,\ninclination, filling factor) in ARs and in the QS, so that the larger\nbrightness of magnetic elements in the QS remains unexplained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 14:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Recent observations have shown that only a small fraction\n(~ 0.1%-1%) of AGNs at redshift z<~ 0.3 are dual with kpc-scale separations,\nwhich is rather low compared to the high merger rate of galaxies. Here we\nconstruct a phenomenological model to estimate the number density of dual AGNs\nand its evolution according to the observationally-estimated major merger rates\nof galaxies and various scaling relations on the properties of galaxies and\ntheir central massive black holes. We show that our model reproduces the\nobserved frequency and separation distribution of dual AGNs provided that\nsignificant nuclear activities are triggered only in gas-rich progenitor\ngalaxies with central massive black holes and only when the nuclei of these\ngalaxies are roughly within the half-light radii of their companion galaxies.\nUnder these constraints, the observed low dual AGN frequency is consistent with\nthe relatively high merger rate of galaxies and supports the hypothesis that\nmajor mergers lead to AGN/QSO activities. We also predict that the number of\nkpc-scale dual AGNs decreases with increasing redshift and only about\n0.02%--0.06% of AGNs are dual AGNs with double-peaked narrow line features at\nredshifts of z 0.5-1.2.

The detection of the pulsation\nduring more than one outburst permits to obtain a better constraint of the\norbital parameters and their evolution as well as to track the secular spin\nfrequency evolution of the source. Methods. Using the RXTE data of the last\noutburst of the AMP XTE J1751-305, we performed a timing analysis to improve\nthe orbital parameters.
