The sensor nodes in the sleep state do\nnot sample or communicate any information to the fusion centre (FC), thereby\nconserving energy. At each time slot, the FC, after having received the samples\nfrom the sensor nodes in the wake state, makes a decision to stop (and thus\ndeclare that the event has occurred) or to continue observing. If it decides to\ncontinue, the FC also makes the decision of choosing the number of sensor nodes\nto be in the wake state in the next time slot. We consider three alternative\napproaches to the problem of choosing the number of sensor nodes to be in the\nwake state in time slot k+1, based on the information available at time slot k,\nnamely, 1. optimal control of M_{k+1}, the number of sensor nodes to be in the\nawake state in time slot k+1, 2. optimal control of q_{k+1}, the probability of\na sensor node to be in the awake state in time slot k+1, and 3. optimal\nprobability q that a sensor node is in the awake state in any time slot. In\neach case, we formulate the problem as a sequential decision process. We show\nthat a sufficient statistic for the decision at time k is the a posteriori\nprobability of change Pi_k. Also, we show that the optimal stopping rule is a\nthreshold rule on Pi_k. The optimal policy for M_{k+1} can keep very few\nsensors wake during the prechange phase and then quickly increase the number of\nsensors in the wake state when a change is \"suspected\". Among the three\nsleep-wake algorithms described, we observe that the total cost is minimum for\nthe optimum control of M_{k+1} and is maximum for the optimum control on q.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 16:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-31"}

The method of deriving photometric metallicities using red giant branch\nstars is applied to resolved stellar populations under the common assumption\nthat they mainly consist of single-age old stellar populations. We explore the\neffect of the presence of mixed-age stellar populations on deriving photometric\nmetallicities. Methods. We use photometric data sets for the five Galactic\ndwarf spheroidals Sculptor, Sextans, Carina, Fornax, and Leo II in order to\nderive their photometric metallicity distribution functions from their resolved\nred giant branches using isochrones of the Dartmouth Stellar Evolutionary\nDatabase. We compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic\nmetallicities based on the analysis of the near-infrared Ca triplet (Ca T),\nboth on the metallicity scale of Carretta & Gratton and on the scale defined by\nthe Dartmouth isochrones. In addition, we compare the photometric metallicities\nwith published spectroscopic metallicities based on spectral synthesis and\nmedium-resolution spectroscopy, and on high resolution spectra where available.\nResults. The mean properties of the spectroscopic and photometric metallicity\nsamples are comparable within the intrinsic scatter of each method although the\nmean metallicities of dSphs with pronounced intermediate-age population\nfractions may be underestimated by the photometric method by up to a few tenths\nof dex in [Fe/H]. The star-by-star differences of the spectroscopic minus the\nphotometric metallicities show a wide range of values along the fiducial\nspectroscopic metallicity range, with the tendency to have systematically lower\nphotometric metallicities for those dwarf spheroidals with a higher fraction of\nintermediate-age populations. Such discrepancies persist even in the case of\nthe purely old Sculptor dSph, where one would na\\\"ively expect a very good\nmatch when comparing with medium or low resolution metallicity measurements.\nOverall, the agreement between Ca T metallicities and photometric metallicities\nis very good in the metallicity range from ~ -2 dex to ~ -1.5 dex. We find that\nthe photometric method is reliable in galaxies that contain small (less than\n15%) intermediate-age stellar fractions. Therefore, in the presence of\nmixed-age stellar populations, one needs to quantify the fraction of the\nintermediate-age stars in order to assess their effect on determining\nmetallicities from photometry alone. Finally, we note that the comparison of\nspectroscopic metallicities of the same stars obtained with different methods\nreveals similarly large discrepancies as the comparison with photometric\nmetallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 16:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}

Then, it is natural to accommodate the right-handed neutrinos\nwith the same $B-L$ charge in a doublet of the discrete $S_3$ symmetry, and the\nthird one in a singlet. If the Yukawa interactions involving right-handed\nneutrinos are invariant under $S_3$, the quasi-Dirac neutrino scheme arise\nnaturally in this model. However, we will show how in this scheme it is\npossible to give a value for $\\theta_{13}$ in agreement with the Daya Bay\nresults.

We consider two\nprocedures at the fusion center to process the measurements. The Bayesian\nsetting is assumed; i.e., the fusion center has a prior distribution on the\nchange time. In the first procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion\ncenter is \\emph{network-oblivious} and makes a decision only when a complete\nvector of measurements taken at a sampling instant is available. In the second\nprocedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion center is \\emph{network-aware}\nand processes measurements as they arrive, but in a time causal order. In this\ncase, the decision statistic depends on the network delays as well, whereas in\nthe network-oblivious case, the decision statistic does not depend on the\nnetwork delays. This yields a Bayesian change detection problem with a tradeoff\nbetween the random network delay and the decision delay; a higher sampling rate\nreduces the decision delay but increases the random access delay. Under\nperiodic sampling, in the network--oblivious case, the structure of the optimal\nstopping rule is the same as that without the network, and the optimal change\ndetection delay decouples into the network delay and the optimal decision delay\nwithout the network. In the network--aware case, the optimal stopping problem\nis analysed as a partially observable Markov decision process, in which the\nstates of the queues and delays in the network need to be maintained. A\nsufficient statistic for decision is found to be the network-state and the\nposterior probability of change having occurred given the measurements received\nand the state of the network. The optimal regimes are studied using simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 18:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Such functions\ncan be particularly well understood when the relational structure is countably\ninfinite and has a first-order definition in another relational structure which\nhas a finite language, is totally ordered and homogeneous, and has the Ramsey\nproperty. This is because in this situation, Ramsey theory provides the\ncombinatorial tool for analyzing these functions -- in a certain sense, it\nallows to represent such functions by functions on finite sets.\n  This is a survey of results in model theory and theoretical computer science\nobtained recently by the authors in this context.

The method known as\n\"the MacDonald torque\" is often combined with an assumption that the quality\nfactor Q is frequency-independent. This makes the method inconsistent, because\nthe MacDonald theory tacitly fixes the rheology by making Q scale as the\ninverse tidal frequency.\n  Spin-orbit coupling can be treated also in an approach called \"the Darwin\ntorque\". While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary\nfrequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the\nliterature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal\nfrequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a\ncorrected version of the MacDonald torque.\n  However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties\nof realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is\nmore complex. Hence the necessity to enrich the theory of spin-orbit\ninteraction with the right frequency-dependence. We accomplish this programme\nfor the Darwin-torque-based model near resonances. We derive the\nfrequency-dependence of the tidal torque from the first principles, i.e., from\nthe expression for the mantle's compliance in the time domain. We also explain\nthat the tidal torque includes not only the secular part, but also an\noscillating part.\n  We demonstrate that the lmpq term of the Darwin-Kaula expansion for the tidal\ntorque smoothly goes through zero, when the secondary traverses the lmpq\nresonance (e.g., the principal tidal torque smoothly goes through nil as the\nsecondary crosses the synchronous orbit).\n  We also offer a possible explanation for the unexpected frequency-dependence\nof the tidal dissipation rate in the Moon, discovered by LLR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 19:53:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 22:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 03:21:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 19:21:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 15:53:43 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 00:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 23:55:13 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 17:43:54 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2012 00:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

However, at low star formation rates (SFRs), the\nHalpha to FUV ratio can vary due to stochastic sampling even for a universal\nIMF, a hypothesis that has, prior to this work, received limited investigation.\nUsing SLUG, a fully stochastic code for synthetic photometry in star clusters\nand galaxies, we compare the Halpha and FUV luminosity in a sample of ~450\nnearby galaxies with models drawn from a universal Kroupa IMF and a modified\nIMF, the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF). Once random\nsampling and time evolution are included, a Kroupa IMF convolved with the\ncluster mass function reproduces the observed Halpha distribution at all FUV\nluminosities, while a truncated IMF as implemented in current IGIMF models\nunderpredicts the Halpha luminosity by more than an order of magnitude at the\nlowest SFRs. We conclude that the observed luminosity is the result of the\njoint probability distribution function of the SFR, cluster mass function, and\na universal IMF, consistent with parts of the IGIMF theory, but that a\ntruncation in the IMF in clusters is inconsistent with the observations. Future\nwork will examine stochastic star formation and its time dependence in detail\nto study whether random sampling can explain other observations that suggest a\nvarying IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 20:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2011 00:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Consistency means that any solution of the dimensionally-reduced theory\nlifts to give a solution in the higher dimension. Although supersymmetry seems\nto play a role in the consistency of these reductions, it cannot be the whole\nstory since consistent sphere reductions of non-supersymmetric theories are\nalso known, such as the reduction of the effective action of the bosonic string\nin any dimension D on either a 3-sphere or a (D-3)-sphere, retaining the gauge\nbosons of SO(4) or SO(D-2) respectively.

A projection of the full integrability condition\nfor these Killing spinors gives rise to the bosonic equations of motion (just\nas happens in the supergravity examples).

However, many real world objects\nare recursive and associative in nature which makes storage in the relational\nmodel difficult. The hypergraph model is a generalization of a graph model,\nwhere each hypernode can be made up of other nodes or graphs and each hyperedge\ncan be made up of one or more edges. It may address the recursive and\nassociative limitations of relational model. However, the hypergraph model is\nnon-tabular; thus, loses the simplicity of the relational model. In this study,\nwe consider the means to convert a relational model into a hypergraph model in\ntwo layers. At the bottom layer, each relational tuple can be considered as a\nstar graph centered where the primary key node is surrounded by non-primary key\nattributes. At the top layer, each tuple is a hypernode, and a relation is a\nset of hypernodes. We presented a reference implementation of relational\noperators (project, rename, select, inner join, natural join, left join, right\njoin, outer join and Cartesian join) on a hypergraph model. Using a simple\nexample, we demonstrate that a relation and relational operators can be\nimplemented on this hypergraph model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 21:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-01"}

In this work, we\nemploy the idea of sequential detection to obtain a quick, yet reliable,\ndecision regarding primary activity. Local detectors take measurements, and\nonly a few of them transmit the log likelihood ratios (LLR) to a fusion center\nin descending order of LLR magnitude. The fusion center runs a sequential test\nwith a maximum imposed on the number of sensors that can report their LLR\nmeasurements. We calculate the detection thresholds using two methods.

Spacetime torsion,\ngenerated by spin of Dirac fields, induces gravitational repulsion in fermionic\nmatter at extremely high densities and prevents the formation of singularities.\nAccordingly, the big bang is replaced by a bounce that occurred when the energy\ndensity $\\epsilon\\propto gT^4$ was on the order of $n^2/m_\\textrm{Pl}^2$ (in\nnatural units), where $n\\propto gT^3$ is the fermion number density and $g$ is\nthe number of thermal degrees of freedom. If the early Universe contained only\nthe known standard-model particles ($g\\approx 100$), then the energy density at\nthe big bounce was about 15 times larger than the Planck energy.

If more fermions existed in\nthe early Universe, then the spin-torsion coupling causes a bounce at a lower\nenergy and larger scale factor. Recent observations of high-energy photons from\ngamma-ray bursts indicate that spacetime may behave classically even at scales\nbelow the Planck length, supporting the classical spin-torsion mechanism of the\nbig bounce.

We derive exact results for the\nradiation-induced mobility as well as the thermal friction force in terms of\nthe equilibrium dispersion relation of the dressed impurity (depleton). These\nresults show that there is a wide range of external forces where the (drifted)\nBloch oscillations exist and may be observed experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 23:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-22"}

It is found that the magnetic\npressure can be as high as ~50% of the gas pressure in the inner region of the\nADAF close to the black hole horizon, even if the external imposed vertical\nfield strength is <5% of the gas pressure at the outer radius of the ADAF,\nwhich is caused by the gas plunging rapidly to the black hole within the\nmarginal stable circular orbit. In the inner region of the ADAF, the flow is\nsignificantly pressured in the vertical direction by the magnetic field, and\ntherefore its gas pressure can be two orders of magnitude higher than that in\nthe ADAF without magnetic fields. This means that the magnetic field strength\nnear the black hole is underestimated by assuming equipartition between\nmagnetic and gas pressure with the conventional ADAF model.

Some of these systems\nare, or may be, high-mass binaries harboring young nonaccreting pulsars, in\nwhich the stellar and the pulsar winds collide, generating a powerful outflow\nthat should terminate at some point in the ambient medium. This work studies\nthe evolution and termination, as well as the related radiation, of the\nshocked-wind flow generated in high-mass binaries hosting powerful pulsars. A\ncharacterization, based on previous numerical work, is given for the\nstellar/pulsar wind interaction. Then, an analytical study of the further\nevolution of the shocked flow and its dynamical impact on the surrounding\nmedium is carried out. Finally, the expected nonthermal emission from the flow\ntermination shock, likely the dominant emitting region, is calculated. The\nshocked wind structure, initially strongly asymmetric, becomes a\nquasi-spherical, supersonically expanding bubble, with its energy coming from\nthe pulsar and mass from the stellar wind. This bubble eventually interacts\nwith the environment on ~pc scales, producing a reverse and, sometimes, a\nforward shock. Nonthermal leptonic radiation can be efficient in the reverse\nshock. Radio emission is expected to be faint, whereas X-rays can easily reach\ndetectable fluxes. Under very low magnetic fields and large nonthermal\nluminosities, gamma rays may also be significant. We conclude that the\ncomplexity of the stellar/pulsar wind interaction is likely to be smoothed out\noutside the binary system, where the wind-mixed flow accelerates and eventually\nterminates in a strong reverse shock. This shock may be behind the extended\nX-rays observed in some binary systems. For very powerful pulsars, part of the\nunshocked pulsar wind may directly interact with the large-scale environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2011 10:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 18:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 13:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Recently, it was\nsuggested to generate high-energy photons with non-zero OAM (twisted photons)\nby the Compton backscattering of laser twisted photons on relativistic electron\nbeams. Twisted electrons in the intermediate energy range have also been\ndemostrated experimentally; twisted protons and other particles can in\nprinciple be created in a similar way. Collisions of energetic twisted states\ncan offer a new look at particle properties and interactions. A theoretical\ndescription of twisted particle scattering developed previously treated them as\npure Bessel states and ran into difficulty when describing the OAM of the final\ntwisted particle at non-zero scattering angles. Here we develop further this\nformalism by incorporating two additional important features. First, we treat\nthe initial OAM state as a wave packet of a finite transverse size rather than\na pure Bessel state. This realistic assumption allows us to resolve the\nexisting controversy between two theoretical analyses for non-forward\nscattering. Second, we describe the final twisted particle in terms of the\norbital helicity --- the OAM projection on its average direction of propagation\nrather than on the fixed reaction axis. Using this formalism, we determine to\nwhat extent the twisted state is transferred from the initial to final OAM\nparticle in a generic scattering kinematics. As a particular application, we\nprove that in the Compton backscattering the orbital helicity of the final\nphoton stays close to the OAM projection of the initial photon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2011 11:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 13:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We investigate the possibility that photophoresis\nprovides a viable mechanism to transport high-temperature materials from the\ninner solar system to the regions in which the comets were forming.

The particles\nconsidered here are in the form of aggregates that presumably were assembled\nfrom hot mineral individual grains ranging down to submicron sizes and formed\nby condensation within the hottest portion of the solar nebula.

On the other hand, 10-5 to 10-4 m\naggregates are continuously pushed outward during the evolution of the solar\nnebula.

This result has been a puzzle, but we now find that this is simply\nan abundance effect: We show that these strong CO2 bands can be explained with\nthe UCMs based on the classical C & O abundances (log Ac and log Ao), which are\nabout 0.2 dex larger compared to the recent values. Since three other brown\ndwarfs could be well interpreted with the recent solar C & O abundances, we\nrequire at least two model sequences based on the different chemical\ncompositions to interpret all the AKARI spectra. The reason for this is that\nthe CO2 band is especially sensitive to C & O abundances, since the CO2\nabundance depends approximately on AcAo^2 --- the cube of C & O abundances. For\nthis reason, even low resolution spectra of very cool dwarfs, especially of CO2\ncannot be understood unless a model with proper abundances is applied. For the\nsame reason, CO2 is an excellent indicator of C & O abundances, and we can now\nestimate C & O abundances of brown dwarfs: Three out of six brown dwarfs\nobserved with AKARI should have high C & O abundances similar to the classical\nsolar values (e.g. logAc = 8.60 and logAo = 8.92), but the other three may have\nlow C & O abundances similar to the recent solar values (e.g. logAc = 8.39 and\nlogAo = 8.69).

To this end we use a program\nabstraction in which transitions are described by Monotonicity Constraints over\n(abstract) variables. When only constraints of the form x>y' and x\\geq y' are\nallowed, we have size-change graphs. In the last decade, both theory and\npractice have evolved significantly in this restricted framework. The crucial\nunderlying assumption of most of the past work is that the domain of the\nvariables is well-founded. In a recent paper I showed how to extend and adapt\nsome theory from the domain of size-change graphs to general monotonicity\nconstraints, thus complementing previous work, but remaining in the realm of\nwell-founded domains. However, monotonicity constraints are, interestingly,\ncapable of proving termination also in the integer domain, which is not\nwell-founded. The purpose of this paper is to explore the application of\nmonotonicity constraints in this domain. We lay the necessary theoretical\nfoundation, and present precise decision procedures for termination; finally,\nwe provide a procedure to construct explicit global ranking functions from\nmonotonicity constraints in singly-exponential time, and of optimal worst-case\nsize and dimension (ordinal).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2011 15:42:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 20:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

This is especially the case in\nBayesian hierarchical models, where different decision-theoretic frameworks can\nbe deployed to summarize such parameter ensembles. The estimation of these\nparameter ensembles may thus substantially vary depending on which inferential\ngoals are prioritised by the modeller. In this note, we consider the problem of\nclassifying the elements of a parameter ensemble above or below a given\nthreshold. Two threshold classification losses (TCLs) --weighted and\nunweighted-- are formulated. The weighted TCL can be used to emphasize the\nestimation of false positives over false negatives or the converse. We prove\nthat the weighted and unweighted TCLs are optimized by the ensembles of\nunit-specific posterior quantiles and posterior medians, respectively. In\naddition, we relate these classification loss functions on parameter ensembles\nto the concepts of posterior sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we find some\nrelationships between the unweighted TCL and the absolute value loss, which\nexplain why both functions are minimized by posterior medians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2011 15:54:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 14:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-10"}
