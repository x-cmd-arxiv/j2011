Each iteration of the method consists of three steps. In the first\nstep, a tentative new iterate is generated by a stand-alone one-step process,\nfor which we use alternating least squares (ALS). In the second step, an\naccelerated iterate is generated by a nonlinear generalized minimal residual\n(GMRES) approach, recombining previous iterates in an optimal way, and\nessentially using the stand-alone one-step process as a preconditioner. In\nparticular, the nonlinear extension of GMRES is used that was proposed by\nWashio and Oosterlee in [ETNA Vol. 15 (2003), pp. 165-185] for nonlinear\npartial differential equation problems. In the third step, a line search is\nperformed for globalization. The resulting nonlinear GMRES (N-GMRES)\noptimization algorithm is applied to dense and sparse tensor decomposition test\nproblems. The numerical tests show that ALS accelerated by N-GMRES may\nsignificantly outperform both stand-alone ALS and a standard nonlinear\nconjugate gradient optimization method, especially when highly accurate\nstationary points are desired for difficult problems. The proposed N-GMRES\noptimization algorithm is based on general concepts and may be applied to other\nnonlinear optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 16:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-27"}

The method can also be applied to BIEs with oscillatory\nkernels such as those associated with the Helmholtz and Maxwell equations; it\nis efficient at long and intermediate wave-lengths, but will eventually become\nprohibitively slow as the wave-length decreases. To achieve linear complexity,\nrank deficiencies in the off-diagonal blocks of the coefficient matrix are\nexploited.

In particular, in the limit that one hole is much smaller than the\nother, and the infall starts from an infinite initial separation, we recover\nthe point-particle limit. Thus, numerical relativity is able to bridge the gap\nbetween fully non-linear dynamics and linearized approximations, which may have\nimportant applications. Finally, we also comment on the \"spurious\" radiation\ncontent in the initial data and the linearized predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 20:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We study a bolometric regime (<Lbol > 8 x 10^45 erg/s)\nwhere several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the main\nfueling channel for black hole accretion. We confirm that obscured quasars\nmainly reside in massive galaxies (Mstar>10^10 Msun) and that the fraction of\ngalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellar\nmass. We stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitude\ndiagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring the\ninfluence that AGN activity can have on such a process. We instead use the\ncorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forming\ngalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. We find that at z ~1,\n~62% of Type-2 QSOs hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates are\ncomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. The fraction of\nstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. We\nalso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specific\nstar-formation rate of the Type-2 QSO hosts is in excellent agreement with that\nmeasured for star-forming galaxies. From the morphological analysis, we\nconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only a\nfew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. Finally, bulge-dominated\ngalaxies tend to host Type-2 QSOs with low Eddington ratios (lambda<0.1), while\ndisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers BHs accreting at high\nEddington ratios (lambda > 0.1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 20:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 14:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This in turn yields well-posedness results for the\nnonlinear wave equation on such manifolds. Morawetz estimates on the cone are\nalso treated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 21:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-30"}

Instead,\nclouds without star formation seem to possess a lognormal distribution, while\nclouds with active star formation develope a power-law tail at high column\ndensities. The lognormal behavior of the Npdf has been interpreted in terms of\nturbulent motions dominating the dynamics of the clouds, while the power-law\nbehavior occurs when the cloud is dominated by gravity. In the present\ncontribution we use thermally bi-stable numerical simulations of cloud\nformation and evolution to show that, indeed, these two regimes can be\nunderstood in terms of the formation and evolution of molecular clouds: a very\nnarrow lognormal regime appears when the cloud is being assembled. However, as\nthe global gravitational contraction occurs, the initial density fluctuations\nare enhanced, resulting, first, in a wider lognormal Npdf, and later, in a\npower-law Npdf. We thus suggest that the observed Npdf of molecular clouds are\na manifestation of their global gravitationally contracting state. We also show\nthat, contrary to recent suggestions, the exact value of the power-law slope is\nnot unique, as it depends on the projection in which the cloud is being\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 21:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In this paper we study the basic\nissues underlying such representation formalisms and single out both their\ncommon characteristics and their distinguishing features. Such investigation\nleads us to propose a unifying framework in which we are able to capture the\nfundamental aspects of several representation languages used in different\ncontexts. The proposed formalism is expressed in the style of description\nlogics, which have been introduced in knowledge representation as a means to\nprovide a semantically well-founded basis for the structural aspects of\nknowledge representation systems. The description logic considered in this\npaper is a subset of first order logic with nice computational characteristics.\nIt is quite expressive and features a novel combination of constructs that has\nnot been studied before. The distinguishing constructs are number restrictions,\nwhich generalize existence and functional dependencies, inverse roles, which\nallow one to refer to the inverse of a relationship, and possibly cyclic\nassertions, which are necessary for capturing real world domains. We are able\nto show that it is precisely such combination of constructs that makes our\nlogic powerful enough to model the essential set of features for defining class\nstructures that are common to frame systems, object-oriented database\nlanguages, and semantic data models. As a consequence of the established\ncorrespondences, several significant extensions of each of the above formalisms\nbecome available. The high expressiveness of the logic we propose and the need\nfor capturing the reasoning in different contexts forces us to distinguish\nbetween unrestricted and finite model reasoning. A notable feature of our\nproposal is that reasoning in both cases is decidable. We argue that, by virtue\nof the high expressive power and of the associated reasoning capabilities on\nboth unrestricted and finite models, our logic provides a common core for\nclass-based representation formalisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 01:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-30"}

By starting from a torus threaded with weak toroidal magnetic\nfields and by controlling the central density of the initial torus, rho_0, we\ncan reproduce three distinct modes of accretion flow. In model A with the\nhighest central density, an optically and geometrically thick supercritical\naccretion disk is created. The radiation force greatly exceeds the gravity\nabove the disk surface, thereby driving a strong outflow (or jet). Because of\nthe mild beaming, the apparent (isotropic) photon luminosity is ~22L_E (where\nL_E is the Eddington luminosity) in the face-on view. Even higher apparent\nluminosity is feasible if we increase the flow density. In model B with a\nmoderate density, radiative cooling of the accretion flow is so efficient that\na standard-type, cold, and geometrically thin disk is formed at radii greater\nthan ~7R_S (where R_S is the Schwarzschild radius), while the flow is\nradiatively inefficient otherwise. The magnetic-pressure-driven disk wind\nappears in this model. In model C the density is too low for the flow to be\nradiatively efficient. The flow thus becomes radiatively inefficient accretion\nflow, which is geometrically thick and optically thin. The magnetic-pressure\nforce, in cooperation with the gas-pressure force, drives outflows from the\ndisk surface, and the flow releases its energy via jets rather than via\nradiation.

Most prior work on IA is based on the impractical assumption that\nperfect and global channel-state information(CSI) is available at all\ntransmitters. To implement IA, each receiver has to feed back CSI to all\ninterferers, resulting in overwhelming feedback overhead. In particular, the\nsum feedback rate of each receiver scales quadratically with the number of\nusers even if the quantized CSI is fed back. To substantially suppress feedback\noverhead, this paper focuses on designing efficient arrangements of feedback\nlinks, called feedback topologies, under the IA constraint. For the\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) K-user interference channel, we propose\nthe feedback topology that supports sequential CSI exchange (feedback and\nfeedforward) between transmitters and receivers so as to achieve IA\nprogressively. This feedback topology is shown to reduce the network feedback\noverhead from a cubic function of K to a linear one. To reduce the delay in the\nsequential CSI exchange, an alternative feedback topology is designed for\nsupporting two-hop feedback via a control station, which also achieves the\nlinear feedback scaling with K. Next, given the proposed feedback topologies,\nthe feedback-bit allocation algorithm is designed for allocating feedback bits\nby each receiver to different feedback links so as to regulate the residual\ninterference caused by the finite-rate feedback. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed bit allocation leads to significant throughput gains\nespecially in strong interference environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 04:40:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 03:47:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 00:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 05:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Past work in this area has primarily focused on obtaining a\nrepresentative sample of nodes and on efficient estimation of local graph\nproperties (such as node degree distribution or any node attribute) based on\nthat sample. However, less is known about estimating the global topology of the\nunderlying graph.\n  In this paper, we show how to efficiently estimate the coarse-grained\ntopology of a graph from a probability sample of nodes. In particular, we\nconsider that nodes are partitioned into categories (e.g., countries or\nwork/study places in OSNs), which naturally defines a weighted category graph.\nWe are interested in estimating (i) the size of categories and (ii) the\nprobability that nodes from two different categories are connected. For each of\nthe above, we develop a family of estimators for design-based inference under\nuniform or non-uniform sampling, employing either of two measurement\nstrategies: induced subgraph sampling, which relies only on information about\nthe sampled nodes; and star sampling, which also exploits category information\nabout the neighbors of sampled nodes. We prove consistency of these estimators\nand evaluate their efficiency via simulation on fully known graphs.

By\nstudying the average properties of emission line profiles synthesized from the\nsimulation runs and comparing them to observations with present-day\ninstrumentation, we investigate the origin of mass flows in the solar\ntransition region and corona. Doppler shifts were determined from the emission\nline profiles of various extreme-ultraviolet emission lines formed in the range\nof $T=10^4-10^6$ K. Plasma velocities and mass flows were investigated for\ntheir contribution to the observed Doppler shifts in the model. In particular,\nthe temporal evolution of plasma flows along the magnetic field lines was\nanalyzed. Comparing observed vs. modeled Doppler shifts shows a good\ncorrelation in the temperature range $\\log(T$/[K])=4.5-5.7, which is the basis\nof our search for the origin of the line shifts. The vertical velocity obtained\nwhen weighting the velocity by the density squared is shown to be almost\nidentical to the corresponding Doppler shift. Therefore, a direct comparison\nbetween Doppler shifts and the model parameters is allowed. A simple\ninterpretation of Doppler shifts in terms of mass flux leads to overestimating\nthe mass flux. Upflows in the model appear in the form of cool pockets of gas\nthat heat up slowly as they rise. Their low temperature means that these\npockets are not observed as blueshifts in the transition region and coronal\nlines. For a set of magnetic field lines, two different flow phases could be\nidentified. The coronal part of the field line is intermittently connected to\nsubjacent layers of either strong or weak heating, leading either to mass flows\ninto the loop or to the draining of the loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 07:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The GW\nself-energy corrections transform the SiC sheet from a indirect LDA band gap to\na direct band gap material. Furthermore, the quasiparticle band gaps of SiC-NTs\nwith different chiralities behave very differently as a function of tube\ndiameter, and this can be attributed to the difference in the curvature-induced\norbital rehybridization between the different chiral nanotubes.

The modifications of the classical DLA model are in the attachment\nto the cluster rules and in the scheme of particle generation/killing. In the\nclassical DLA model if a particle reaches the growing cluster it sticks to it\nimmediately and irreversibly and then the next particle is released. We will\nabandon this original prerequisite, and by changing the sticking probability to\nthe cluster we will change the diffusion regime towards more kinetic one. For a\ngrowing cluster consisting of only one type of particles this variation in the\nsticking probability is (more or less) a rude violation of the hypothesis for\ndiffusion limitation in the DLA model. Since in a lot of experiments different\ntypes of particles are used with different sticking probabilities (e.g.\ndifferent regimes of attachment), we develop a modified DLA model with two\ntypes of particles. The second modification we introduce at that point is a\nscheme for particle generation/killing we call \"second chance\" - when a\nparticle is killed after reaching a given limiting distance from the cluster,\nit is killed and then returned to the point it was originally generated.

However, for A-type\nsupergiants the standard m-CAK solution predicts values of mass loss and\nterminal velocity higher than the observed values. Based on the existence of a\nslow wind solution in fast rotating massive stars, we explore numerically the\nparameter space of radiation-driven flows to search for new wind solutions in\nslowly rotating stars, that could explain the origin of these discrepancies. We\nsolve the 1-D hydrodynamical equation of rotating radiation-driven winds at\ndifferent stellar latitudes and explore the influence of ionization's changes\nthroughout the wind in the velocity profile.

In the case of slow\nrotating A-type supergiant stars the presence of this novel slow solution at\nall latitudes leads to mass losses and wind terminal velocities which are in\nagreement with the observed values. The theoretical Wind Momentum-Luminosity\nRelationship derived with these slow solutions shows very good agreement with\nthe empirical relationship. In addition, the ratio between the terminal and\nescape velocities, which provides a simple way to predict stellar wind energy\nand momentum input into the interstellar medium, is also properly traced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 14:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Despite their fundamental role in complex\nsystems, traveling waves remain elusive because they are often dominated by\nrare fluctuations in the wave tip, which have defied any rigorous analysis so\nfar. Here, we show that by adjusting nonlinear model details, noisy traveling\nwaves can be solved exactly. The moment equations of these tuned models are\nclosed and have a simple analytical structure resembling the deterministic\napproximation supplemented by a nonlocal cutoff term. The peculiar form of the\ncutoff shapes the noisy edge of traveling waves and is critical for the correct\nprediction of the wave speed and its fluctuations. Our approach is illustrated\nand benchmarked using the example of fitness waves arising in simple models of\nmicrobial evolution, which are highly sensitive to number fluctuations. We\ndemonstrate explicitly how these models can be tuned to account for finite\npopulation sizes and determine how quickly populations adapt as a function of\npopulation size and mutation rates. More generally, our method is shown to\napply to a broad class of models, in which number fluctuations are generated by\nbranching processes. Because of this versatility, the method of model tuning\nmay serve as a promising route toward unraveling universal properties of\ncomplex discrete particle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 15:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-30"}

To elucidate the origin of these discrepancies,\nwe present a series of idealized 3D compressible magnetoconvection experiments\nthat differ from previous such experiments in several details, bringing them\ncloser to realistic solar conditions. An initially vertical magnetic field B 0\nis imposed on a time snapshot of fully developed solar-like turbulent\nconvection in a layer bounded by a stable layer from above. Upon relaxation to\na statistically steady state, the structure of the flow field and magnetic\nfield is examined. Instead of the vigorous granular convection (GRC) well known\nto take place in magnetized or weakly magnetized convection, for high values of\nB0 heat is transported by small-scale convection (SSC) in the form of narrow,\npersistent convective columns consisting of slender upflows accompanied by\nadjacent downflow patches, which are reminiscent of the 'convectons' identified\nin earlier semianalytic models. For moderate field strengths, flux separation\n(FXS) is observed: isolated field-free inclusions of GRC are embedded in a\nstrongly magnetized plasma with SSC. Between the SSC and FXS regimes, a\ntransitional regime (F/S) is identified where convectons dynamically evolve\ninto multiply segmented granular inclusions and back. Our results agree in some\naspects more closely with observed umbral structures than earlier idealized\nmodels, because they do reproduce the strong localized, patchy downflows\nimmediately adjacent to the narrow convective columns. Based on recent\nobservations of umbral dots, we suggest that in some cases the conditions in\nsunspot umbrae correspond to the newly identified F/S transitional regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 15:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 07:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

In [1] Patil et al., proposed a cross-layer routing protocol named\nCost Based Power Aware Cross Layer - AODV (CPACL-AODV) which overcomes the\nlimitation of battery power of nodes.

Jaynes, originator of the maximum entropy interpretation of statistical\nmechanics, emphasized that there is an inevitable trade-off between the\nconflicting requirements of robustness and accuracy for any inferencing\nalgorithm. This is because robustness requires discarding of information in\norder to reduce the sensitivity to outliers. The principal of nonlinear\nstatistical coupling, which is an interpretation of the Tsallis entropy\ngeneralization, can be used to quantify this trade-off. The coupled-surprisal,\n-ln_k (p)=-(p^k-1)/k, is a generalization of Shannon surprisal or the\nlogarithmic scoring rule, given a forecast p of a true event by an inferencing\nalgorithm. The coupling parameter k=1-q, where q is the Tsallis entropy index,\nis the degree of nonlinear coupling between statistical states. Positive\n(negative) values of nonlinear coupling decrease (increase) the surprisal\ninformation metric and thereby biases the risk in favor of decisive (robust)\nalgorithms relative to the Shannon surprisal (k=0). We show that translating\nthe average coupled-surprisal to an effective probability is equivalent to\nusing the generalized mean of the true event probabilities as a scoring rule.\nThe metric is used to assess the robustness, accuracy, and decisiveness of a\nfusion algorithm.

To capitalise on this potential it is necessary to\nmeasure galaxy shapes with great accuracy, which in turn requires a detailed\nmodel for the image blurring, the Point Spread Function (PSF). In general the\nPSF varies with wavelength and therefore the PSF integrated over an observing\nfilter depends on the spectrum of the object. For a typical galaxy the spectrum\nvaries across the galaxy image, thus the PSF depends on the position within the\nimage. We estimate the bias on the shear due to such colour gradients by\nmodelling galaxies using two co-centered, co-elliptical Sersic profiles, each\nwith a different spectrum. We estimate the effect of ignoring colour gradients\nand find the shear bias from a single galaxy can be very large depending on the\nproperties of the galaxy. We find that halving the filter width reduces the\nshear bias by a factor of about 5. We show that, to first order, tomographic\ncosmic shear two point statistics depend on the mean shear bias over the galaxy\npopulation at a given redshift. For a single broad filter, and averaging over a\nsmall galaxy catalogue, we find a mean shear bias which is subdominant to the\npredicted statistical errors for future cosmic shear surveys. However, the true\nmean shear bias may exceed the statistical errors, depending on how accurately\nthe catalogue represents the observed distribution of galaxies in the cosmic\nshear survey. We then investigate the bias on the shear for two-filter imaging\nand find that the bias is reduced by at least an order of magnitude. Lastly, we\nfind that it is possible to calibrate galaxies for which colour gradients were\nignored using two-filter imaging of a fair sample of noisy galaxies, if the\ngalaxy model is known. For a S/N of 25 the number of galaxies required in each\ntomographic redshift bin is of order 1e4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 15:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
