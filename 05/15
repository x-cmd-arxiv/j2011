In order\nto unveil non-perturbative aspects of GPD, we study DDVCS at small $x$ in\ngravitational dual description. Using the complex spin $j$-plane representation\nof DDVCS amplitude, we show that GPD is well-defined and can be extracted from\nthe amplitude even in the strong coupling regime. It also turns out that the\nsaddle point value in the $j$-plane representation plays an important role;\nthere are two phases in the imaginary part of the amplitude of DDVCS and GPD,\ndepending on relative position of the saddle point and the leading pole in the\n$j$-plane, and crossover between them is induced by the change of the\nkinematical variables. The saddle point value also directly controls\nkinematical variable dependence of many observables in one of the two phases,\nand indeed the dependence is qualitatively in nice agreement with HERA\nmeasurements. Such observation that the gravity dual shares basic properties of\nthe real world QCD suggests that information from BFKL theory might be used to\nreduce error in the gravity dual predictions of the form factor and of GPD.\nThis article also serves as a brief summery of a preprint arXiv:1105.2999.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2011 16:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 11:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The recently developed test-field method permits to compute dynamo\ncoefficients from global, direct numerical simulations. The subsequent use of\nthese parameters in mean-field models enables us to compare self-consistent\ndynamo models with their mean-field counterparts. So far, this has been done\nfor a simulation of rotating magnetoconvection and a simple benchmark dynamo,\nwhich are both (quasi-)stationary. Aims. It is shown that chaotically\ntime-dependent dynamos in a low Rossby number regime may be appropriately\ndescribed by corresponding mean-field results. Also, it is pointed out under\nwhich conditions mean-field models do not match direct numerical simulations.\nMethods. We solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in a rotating,\nspherical shell in the Boussinesq approximation. Based on this, we compute\nmean-field coefficients for several models with the help of the previously\ndeveloped test-field method. The parameterization of the mean electromotive\nforce by these coefficients is tested against direct numerical simulations. In\naddition, we use the determined dynamo coefficients in mean-field models and\ncompare the outcome with azimuthally averaged fields from direct numerical\nsimulations. Results. The azimuthally and time-averaged electromotive force in\nfast rotating dynamos is sufficiently well parameterized by the set of\ndetermined mean-field coefficients. In comparison to the previously considered\n(quasi-)stationary dynamo, the chaotic time-dependence leads to an improved\nscale separation and thus to a better agreement between direct numerical\nsimulations and mean-field results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2011 20:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Heat shock is a\nwell-characterized model of cellular dynamics. S. cerevisiae is an appropriate\nmodel organism, since both its protein-protein interaction network\n(interactome) and stress response at the gene expression level have been well\ncharacterized. However, the analysis of the reorganization of the yeast\ninteractome during stress has not been investigated yet. We calculated the\nchanges of the interaction-weights of the yeast interactome from the changes of\nmRNA expression levels upon heat shock. The major finding of our study is that\nheat shock induced a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections\nof yeast interactome modules. In agreement with this the weighted diameter of\nthe yeast interactome had a 4.9-fold increase in heat shock. Several key\nproteins of the heat shock response became centers of heat shock-induced local\ncommunities, as well as bridges providing a residual connection of modules\nafter heat shock. The observed changes resemble to a \"stratus-cumulus\" type\ntransition of the interactome structure, since the unstressed yeast interactome\nhad a globally connected organization, similar to that of stratus clouds,\nwhereas the heat shocked interactome had a multifocal organization, similar to\nthat of cumulus clouds. Our results showed that heat shock induces a partial\ndisintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome. This change\nmay be rather general occurring in many types of stresses. Moreover, other\ncomplex systems, such as single proteins, social networks and ecosystems may\nalso decrease their inter-modular links, thus develop more compact modules, and\ndisplay a partial disintegration of their global structure in the initial phase\nof crisis.

Traditionally, feature selection methods are designed to\nobtain a feature subset that can lead to high classification accuracy. However,\nclassification accuracy has recently been shown to be an inappropriate\nperformance metric of classification systems in many cases. Instead, the Area\nUnder the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and its multi-class\nextension, MAUC, have been proved to be better alternatives. Hence, the target\nof classification system design is gradually shifting from seeking a system\nwith the maximum classification accuracy to obtaining a system with the maximum\nAUC/MAUC. Previous investigations have shown that traditional feature selection\nmethods need to be modified to cope with this new objective. These methods most\noften are restricted to binary classification problems only. In this study, a\nfilter feature selection method, namely MAUC Decomposition based Feature\nSelection (MDFS), is proposed for multi-class classification problems. To the\nbest of our knowledge, MDFS is the first method specifically designed to select\nfeatures for building classification systems with maximum MAUC. Extensive\nempirical results demonstrate the advantage of MDFS over several compared\nfeature selection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2011 12:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-03"}

They should be the final result of an irreversible gravitational\ncollapse of very massive bodies. However, an unsolved problem concerning such\nobjects is the presence of a space-time singularity in their core. Such a\nproblem was present starting by the first historical papers concerning black\nholes. It is a common opinion that this problem could be solved when a correct\nquantum gravity theory will be, finally, constructed. In this work we review a\nway to remove black hole singularities at a classical level i.e. without\narguments of quantum gravity. By using a particular non-linear electrodynamics\nLagrangian, an exact solution of Einstein field equations is shown. The\nsolution prevents the collapsing object to reach the gravitational radius, thus\nthe final result becomes a black star, i.e. an astrophysical object where both\nof singularities and event horizons are removed. Such solution is not only a\nmathematical artifice. In fact, this kind of Lagrangian has been recently used\nin various analysis in astrophysics, like surface of neutron stars and pulsars.\nThe authors also recently adapted the analysis on a cosmological context by\nshowing that the big-bang singularity can be removed too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2011 06:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-20"}
