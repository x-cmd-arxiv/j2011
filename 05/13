We\nmeasure how apparent morphologies (disk, elliptical, peculiar) correlate with\nphysical properties, such as quantitative structure and spectral-types. One\nprimary result is that apparent morphology does not correlate strongly with\nstellar populations, nor with galaxy structure at this epoch, suggesting a\nchaotic formation history for Hubble types at z > 1. By using a locally defined\ndefinition of disk and elliptical galaxies based on structure and\nspectral-type, we find no true ellipticals at z > 2, and a fraction of\n3.2+/-2.3% at 1.5 < z < 2. Local counterparts of disk galaxies are at a similar\nlevel of 7-10%, much lower than the 75% fraction at lower redshifts. We further\ncompare WFC3 images with the rest-frame UV view of galaxies from ACS imaging,\nshowing that galaxies imaged with ACS that appear peculiar often contain an\n`elliptical' like morphology in WFC3. We show through several simulations that\nthis larger fraction of elliptical-like galaxies is partially due to the\ncourser PSF of WFC3, and that the `elliptical' class very likely includes\nearly-type disks. We also measure the merger history for our sample using CAS\nparameters, finding a redshift evolution increasing with redshift, and a peak\nmerger fraction of ~30% at z~2 for the most massive galaxies with M_*> 10^{10}\nM_sol, consistent with previous results from ACS and NICMOS. We compare our\nresults to semi-analytical model results and find a relatively good agreement\nbetween our morphological break-down and the predictions. Finally, we argue\nthat the peculiars, ellipticals and peculiar ellipticals have similar\nproperties, suggesting similar formation modes, likely driven by major mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 16:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of\napoptosis is governed up-stream of mitochondria, by the family of Bcl-2\nproteins, and down-stream of mitochondria, by low-probability events, such as\napoptosome formation, and by feedback circuits involving caspases and inhibitor\nof apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as XIAP. All these regulatory mechanisms\nensure that cells only commit to death once a threshold of damage has been\nreached and the anti-apoptotic reserve of the cell is overcome. As cancer cells\nare invariably exposed to strong intracellular and extracellular stress\nstimuli, they are particularly reliant on the expression of anti-apoptotic\nproteins. Hence, many cancer cells undergo apoptosis when exposed to agents\nthat inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 molecules, such as BH3 mimetics, while normal\ncells remain relatively insensitive to single agent treatments with the same\nclass of molecules. Targeting different proteins within the apoptotic network\nwith combinatorial treatment approaches often achieves even greater\nspecificity. This led us to investigate the sensitivity of leukemia and\nlymphoma cells to a pro-apoptotic action of a BH3 mimetic combined with a small\nmolecule inhibitor of XIAP. Using computational probabilistic model of\napoptotic pathway, verified by experimental results from human leukemia and\nlymphoma cell lines, we show that inhibition of XIAP has a non-linear effect on\nsensitization towards apoptosis induced by the BH3 mimetic HA14-1.

The first concept is 'macroscopic realism', which is the\nquality of a physical property of a quantum system being independent of\nobservation at the macroscopic level. The second concept is 'noninvasive\nmeasurability', which is the possibility of performing a measurement without\ndisturbing the subsequent evolution of a system. One of the key requirement for\ntesting the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality, or Bell's time\ninequality, is the ability to perform noninvasive measurements over a qubit\nstate. In this paper, we present a quantum scattering circuit that implements\nsuch a measurement for maximally mixed states. The operation of the circuit is\ndemonstrated using liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in chloroform,\nin which the time correlations of a qubit are measured on a probe (ancillary)\nqubit state.

We find that the ratio of total\nIR luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, IR8 (=Lir/L8), follows a Gaussian\ndistribution centered on IR8=4 and defines an IR main sequence (MS). A minority\npopulation (<20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values of\nIR8 consist of starbursts (SB) with compact projected star formation densities.\nIR8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of star\nformation from compact SBs with high-IR8, high projected IR surface brightness\n(>3x10^10 Lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific SFR (i.e., SBs). The rest-frame,\nUV-2700A size of these distant SBs is typically half that of MS galaxies,\nsupporting the correlation between star formation density and SB activity that\nis measured for the local sample. Locally, (U)LIRGs are systematically in the\nSB mode, whereas most distant (U)LIRGs form stars in the \"normal\" MS mode. This\nconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called\n\"mid-IR excess\" population of galaxies found at z>1.5 by previous studies. MS\ngalaxies have strong PAH emission line features, a broad far-IR bump resulting\nfrom a combination of dust temperatures (Tdust~15-50 K), and an effective\nTdust~31 K, as derived from the peak wavelength of their IR SED. Galaxies in\nthe SB regime instead exhibit weak PAH EW and a sharper far-IR bump with an\neffective Tdust~40 K. Finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far IR\nemission of X-ray AGNs is predominantly produced by star formation and that\ncandidate dusty AGNs with a power-law emission in the mid-IR systematically\noccur in compact, dusty SBs.

We argue that the slow evolution of early-type galaxies out\nto z~1-2 may also provide support for a slow evolution of QSO host BH masses.\nThe result would mean that if high-z QSOs radiate at Eddington rates then low-z\nSyI must radiate at ~100x less than Eddington.

Since the physical heating mechanism remains uncertain\nin massive halos such as groups or clusters, we adopt a simple,\nobservationally-motivated prescription which enforces global thermal\nequilibrium when averaged over large scales. The plasma remains susceptible to\nlocal thermal instability, however, and cooling drives an inward flow of\nmaterial. In contrast to previous results, we argue that the thermal stability\nof the plasma is independent of its convective stability. We find that the\nratio of the cooling timescale to the dynamical timescale t_cool/t_ff controls\nthe saturation of the thermal instability: when t_cool/t_ff < 1, the plasma\ndevelops extended multi-phase structure, whereas when t_cool / t_ff > 1 it does\nnot. (In a companion paper, we show that the criterion for thermal instability\nin a spherical potential is somewhat less stringent, t_cool / t_ff < 10.) When\nthermal conduction is anisotropic with respect to the magnetic field, the\ncriterion for multi-phase structure is essentially independent of the thermal\nconductivity of the plasma. Our criterion for local thermal instability to\nproduce multi-phase structure is an extension of the cold vs. hot accretion\nmodes in galaxy formation that applies at all radii in hot halos, not just to\nthe virial shock. We show that this criterion is consistent with data on\nmulti-phase gas in the ACCEPT sample of clusters; in addition, when t_cool /\nt_ff > 1, the net cooling rate to low temperatures and the mass flux to small\nradii are suppressed enough relative to models without heating to be\nqualitatively consistent with star formation rates and x-ray line emission in\ngroups and clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 06:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-05"}

Here, we use new Chandra\nand XMM-Newton observations obtained 537 and 744 days after the 2006 outburst\nto constrain both the accretion rate onto the white dwarf and the properties of\nthe nova ejecta at these times. We detect low level UV variability with the\nXMM-Newton Optical Monitor on day 744 that is consistent with accretion disk\nflickering, and use this to place a lower limit on the accretion rate. The\nX-ray spectra in both observations are well described by a two component\nthermal plasma model. The first component originates in the nova shell, which\ncan emit X-rays for up to a decade after the outburst. The other component\nlikely arises in the accretion disk boundary layer, and can be equally well fit\nby a single temperature plasma or a cooling flow model. Although the flux of\nthe single temperature model implies an accretion rate that is 40 times lower\nthan theoretical predictions for RS Oph, the best fit cooling flow model\nimplies Mdot < 1.2x10^-8 M_sol/yr 537 days after the outburst, which is within\na factor of 2 of the theoretical accretion rate required to power an outburst\nevery 20 years.

The total star\nformation rate density history is dominated by the large spirals in the volume,\nalthough the sample consists mainly of dwarf galaxies. Our measurement shows a\nfactor of ~3 drop at z~2, in approximate agreement with results from other\nmeasurement techniques. While our results show that the overall star formation\nrate density has decreased since z~1, the measured rates during this epoch are\nhigher than those obtained from other measurement techniques. This enhanced\nrecent star formation rate appears to be largely due to an increase in the\nfraction of star formation contained in low-mass disks at recent times.\nFinally, our results indicate that despite the differences at recent times, the\nepoch of formation of ~50% of the stellar mass in dwarf galaxies was similar to\nthat of ~50% of the stellar mass in large spiral galaxies (z>~2), despite the\nobserved galaxy-to-galaxy diversity among the dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 20:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

However, this\ndoes not by itself prove that core accretion is the dominant mode for the total\nplanet population, since disk instability might conceivably produce and retain\nlarge numbers of planets in the far-out regions of the disk. If this is a\nrelevant scenario, then the outer massive disks of B-stars should be among the\nbest places for massive planets and brown dwarfs to form and reside. In this\nstudy, we present high-contrast imaging of 18 nearby massive stars, of which 15\nare in the B2--A0 spectral type range and provide excellent sensitivity to wide\ncompanions. By comparing our sensitivities to model predictions of disk\ninstability based on physical criteria for fragmentation and cooling, and using\nMonte-Carlo simulations for orbital distributions, we find that ~85 % of such\ncompanions should have been detected in our images on average.

In high density environments,\ngas loss can be achieved via many external mechanisms. However, in relatively\nisolated environments, where these external mechanisms cannot be efficient, gas\nloss must be dominated by some internal processes. We perform Chandra analysis\nof hot gas in five nearby isolated S0 galaxies, based on quantitative\nsubtraction of various stellar contributions. We find that all the galaxies\nstudied in the present work are X-ray faint, with the hot gas luminosity LX<5%\nof the expected Ia SN energy injection rate. We further compare our results\nwith those from relevant recent papers, in order to investigate the energy\nbudget, cold-hot gas relation, and gas removal from S0 galaxies in isolated\nenvironments. We find that elliptical and S0 galaxies are not significantly\ndifferent in LX at the low mass end (typically with LK<1e11Lsun). However, at\nthe high mass end, S0 galaxies tend to have significantly lower LX than\nelliptical galaxies of the same stellar masses. We further discuss the\npotential relation of the diffuse X-ray emission with the cold gas content in\nS0 and elliptical galaxies. We find that LX/LK^2 tends to correlate positively\nwith the total cold gas mass M(H2+HI) for gas-poor galaxies with\nM(H2+HI)<1e8Msun, while they anti-correlate with each other for gas-rich ones.\nThis cold-hot gas relation can be explained in a scenario of galaxy evolution,\nwith the leftover cold gas from the precursor star forming galaxy mainly\nremoved by the long-lasting Ia SN feedback. The two different trends for\ngas-rich and -poor galaxies may be the results of the initial fast decreasing\nSN rate and the later fast decreasing mass-loading to hot gas, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 21:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The\ncharacterization of symplectic double groupoids mentioned above is made\npossible by an observation which provides various ways of realizing the core of\na symplectic double groupoid as a symplectic quotient of the total space, and\nincludes as a special case a result of Zakrzewski concerning Hopf algebra\nobjects in the symplectic category.

HoII is 20 times more luminous in the\nblue-band than KK246 and its HI mass is a factor of 6 higher than in KK246.\nHowever, the amplitudes of the rotation curves (at the last measured point) of\nboth galaxies are very similar, of about 40 km/s at a galactocentric radius of\n7 kpc. This fact is challenging for modified theories of gravity that predict a\none-to-one relation between gravity at any radius and the enclosed baryonic\nmass in galaxies. In particular, MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) predicts an\nasymptotic flat velocity of 60 km/s in HoII. Since the baryonic mass of HoII is\ndominated by the gas component, MOND overboosts its rotation speed even if the\nmass of the stellar disk is taken negligibly small.

To derive this law one usually invokes the Boltzmann\nfactor, itself derived from statistical considerations. We show that this\n(barometric) law may be derived solely from the democritian concept of\ncorpuscles moving in vacuum. We employ a principle of simplicity, namely that\nthis law is \\emph{independent} of the law of corpuscle motion. This view-point\nputs aside restrictive assumptions that are source of confusion. Similar\nobservations apply to the ideal-gas law. In the absence of gravity, when a\ncylinder terminated by a piston, containing a single corpuscle and with height\n$h$ has temperature $\\theta$, the average force that the corpuscle exerts on\nthe piston is: $\\ave{F}=\\theta/h$. This law is valid at any temperature, except\nat very low temperatures when quantum effects are significant and at very high\ntemperatures because the corpuscle may then split into smaller parts. It is\nusually derived under the assumption that the temperature is proportional to\nthe corpuscle kinetic energy, or else, from a form of the quantum theory. In\ncontradistinction, we show that it follows solely from the postulate this it is\nindependent of the law of corpuscle motion. On the physical side we employ only\nthe concept of potential energy. A consistent picture is offered leading to the\nbarometric law when $w\\,h\\gg\\theta$, and to the usual ideal-gas law when\n$w\\,h\\ll\\theta$. The mathematics is elementary.

Initial\nperiods of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 d were considered. For each period three values of\n1.3, 1.1 and 0.9 solar mass were taken as the initial masses of the more\nmassive components. Here the results of the computations of the first\nevolutionary phase are presented, which starts from the initial conditions and\nends when the more massive component reaches its critical Roche lobe. In all\nconsidered cases this phase lasts for several Gyr. For binaries with the higher\ntotal mass and/or longer initial periods this time is equal to, or longer than\nthe main sequence life time of the more massive component. For the remaining\nbinaries it amounts to a substantial fraction of this life time. From the\nstatistical analysis of models, the predicted period distribution of detached\nbinaries with periods shorter than 2 d was obtained and compared to the\nobserved distribution from the ASAS data. An excellent agreement was obtained\nunder the assumption that the period distribution in this range is determined\nsolely by the mass and angular momentum loss due to the magnetized winds. This\nresult indicates, in particular, that virtually all cool detached binaries with\nperiods of a few tenths of a day, believed to be the immediate progenitors of W\nUMa-type stars, were formed from detached systems with periods around 2-3 d and\nthat magnetic braking is the dominant formation mechanism of cool contact\nbinaries. It operates on the time scale of several Gyr rendering them rather\nold, with age of 6-10 Gyr. The results of the present analysis will be used as\ninput data to investigate the subsequent evolution of the binaries, through the\nmass exchange phase and contact or semi-detached configuration till the\nultimate merging of the components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 08:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-05"}

From the daily light-curves of the blazars characterized by a\nremarkable activity, we firstly determine the minimum variability time-scale,\ngiving an upper limit for the size of the emitting region of the sources,\nassumed to be spheroidal blobs in relativistic motion. These regions must be\nsmaller than ~10^-3 parsec. Another interesting time-scale is the duration of\nthe outbursts. We conclude that they cannot correspond to radiation produced by\na single blob moving relativistically along the jet, but they are either the\nsignature of emission from a standing shock extracting energy from a modulated\njet, or the superposition of a number of flares occurring on a shorter\ntime-scale.

In such cases, alternate approaches are needed.\nHere we present results of first principles calculations of austenitic iron\nusing the VASP code.

Since there are a large number of metastable de Sitter vacua\nin string landscape, tunneling transitions to lower metastable vacua through\nthe bubble nucleation occur quite naturally. Although the deviation of Omega_0\nfrom unity is small by the observational bound, we argue that the effect of\nthis small deviation on the large angle CMB anisotropies can be significant for\ntensor-type perturbation in open inflation scenario. We consider the situation\nin which there is a large hierarchy between the energy scale of the quantum\ntunneling and that of the slow-roll inflation in the nucleated bubble. If the\npotential just after tunneling is steep enough, a rapid-roll phase appears\nbefore the slow-roll inflation. In this case the power spectrum is basically\ndetermined by the Hubble rate during the slow-roll inflation. If such\nrapid-roll phase is absent, the power spectrum keeps the memory of the high\nenergy density there in the large angular components. The amplitude of large\nangular components can be enhanced due to the effects of the wall fluctuation\nmode if the bubble wall tension is small. Therefore, one can construct some\nmodels in which the deviation of Omega_0 from unity is large enough to produce\nmeasurable effects. We also consider a more general class of models, where the\nfalse vacuum decay may occur due to Hawking-Moss tunneling, as well as the\nmodels involving more than one scalar field. We discuss scalar perturbations in\nthese models and point out that a large set of such models is already ruled out\nby observational data, unless there was a very long stage of slow-roll\ninflation after the tunneling. These results show that observational data allow\nus to test various assumptions concerning the structure of the string theory\npotentials and the duration of the last stage of inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 09:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 15:35:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2011 01:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-08"}

Recent\nstudies suggest that reconnection at such 3D nulls may play an important role\nin the coronal dynamics. In this paper the properties of the torsional spine\nand torsional fan modes of magnetic reconnection at 3D nulls are investigated.\nNew analytical models are developed, which for the first time include a current\nlayer that is spatially localised around the null, extending along either the\nspine or the fan of the null. These are complemented with numerical\nsimulations. The principal aim is to investigate the effect of varying the\ndegree of asymmetry of the null point magnetic field on the resulting\nreconnection process - where previous studies always considered a non-generic\nradially symmetric null. The geometry of the current layers within which\ntorsional spine and torsional fan reconnection occur is found to be strongly\ndependent on the symmetry of the magnetic field. Torsional spine reconnection\nstill occurs in a narrow tube around the spine, but with elliptical\ncross-section when the fan eigenvalues are different, and with the short axis\nof the ellipse being along the strong field direction. The spatiotemporal peak\ncurrent, and the peak reconnection rate attained, are found not to depend\nstrongly on the degree of asymmetry. For torsional fan reconnection, the\nreconnection occurs in a planar disk in the fan surface, which is again\nelliptical when the symmetry of the magnetic field is broken. The short axis of\nthe ellipse is along the weak field direction, with the current being peaked in\nthese weak field regions. The peak current and peak reconnection rate in this\ncase are clearly dependent on the asymmetry, with the peak current increasing\nbut the reconnection rate decreasing as the degree of asymmetry is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 11:02:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 12:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}

The Rarita-Schwinger description of high-spin fermion fields\ninvolves unphysical degrees of freedom, associated with their lower-spin\ncontent. These enter the interaction if not eliminated outright. The invariance\ncondition of the interaction under the unconstrained Rarita-Schwinger gauge\nremoves the lower-spin content of the fermion propagator and leads to a\nconsistent description of the interaction. We develop the most general,\nconsistent interaction structure for high-spin fermions. We find that the power\nof the momentum dependence of a consistent interaction rises with the spin of\nthe fermion field. This leads to unphysical structures in the energy dependence\nof the computed cross sections when the short-distance physics is cut off with\nstandard hadronic form factors. A novel, spin-dependent hadronic form factor is\nproposed that suppresses the unphysical artifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 11:14:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 10:14:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2011 08:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Our aim is to derive from the radio morphology tight\nconstraints on the direction of the local magnetic field and its gradient, and\non the obliquity dependence of the electron injection efficiency. We perform a\nset of 3D MHD simulations describing the expansion of a spherical SNR through a\nmagnetized medium with a non-uniform ISMF. From the simulations, we derive\nnon-thermal radio maps and compare them with observations of the SN1006\nremnant. We find that the radio morphology of SN1006 at 1 GHz is best-fitted by\na model with quasi-parallel injection efficiency, a magnetic field aspect angle\nof $38^\\circ\\pm 4^\\circ$ with the line of sight, and a gradient of the field\nstrength toward the galactic plane, higher then the expected variations of the\nlarge scale field of the Galaxy.

The study of the synchrotron radio\nemission of SNRs is of crucial importance to derive information on the galactic\nmagnetic field in the vicinity of the remnants, and more hints on the actual\ninjection efficiency scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 11:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

On day 22.9,\nwe observed smooth eclipses in UV and optical but deep dips in the X-ray light\ncurve which disappeared by day 34.9, then yielding clean eclipses in all bands.\nX-ray dips can be caused by clumpy absorbing material that intersects the line\nof sight while moving along highly elliptical trajectories. Cold material from\nthe companion could explain the absence of dips in UV and optical light. The\ndisappearance of X-ray dips before day 34.9 implies significant progress in the\nformation of the disk.

On 2010 October 28, the source displayed a second X-ray\noutburst and a 2 months-long monitoring with Swift was carried out to follow\nthe evolution of the source X-ray flux during the event. We report on the\nINTEGRAL and Swift observations of the second X-ray outburst observed from\nIGRJ19294+1816. We detected pulsations in the X-ray emission from the source at\n\\sim12.5 s up to 50 keV. The source X-ray flux decreased smoothly during the\ntwo months of observation displaying only marginal spectral changes. Due to the\nrelatively rapid decay of the source X-ray flux, no significant variations of\nthe source spin period across the event could be measured. This prevented a\nfirm confirmation of the previously suggested orbital period of the source at\n117 d. This periodicity was also searched by using archival Swift /BAT data. We\ndetected a marginally significant peak in the periodogram and determined the\nbest period at 116.2\\pm0.6 days (estimated chance probability of a spurious\ndetection 1%). The smooth decline of the source X-ray flux across the two\nmonths of observations after the onset of the second outburst, together with\nits relatively low value of the spin period and the absence of remarkable\nchanges in the spectral parameters (i.e., the absorption column density),\nsuggests that IGRJ19294+1816 is most likely another member of the Be X-ray\nbinaries discovered by INTEGRAL and not a supergiant fast X-ray transient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 13:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 18:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We introduce a variational scheme that can go\nbeyond the mean-field (MF) regime and couple in a consistent way pore modified\ncore interactions, steric effects, electrostatic solvation and image-charge\nforces, and surface charge induced electrostatic potential. We show that in the\ndilute limit, the MF and the variational theories agree well with MC simulation\nresults, in contrast to a recent RPA method. The partition of charged Yukawa\nparticles at a neutral dielectric interface (e.g air-water or protein-water\ninterface) is investigated. It is shown that as a result of the competition\nbetween core collisions that push the ions towards the surface, and repulsive\nsolvation and image forces that exclude them from the interface, a\nconcentration peak of finite size ions sets in close to the dielectric\ninterface. We also characterize the role played by the ion size on the ionic\nselectivity of neutral slit nanopores. We show that the complex interplay\nbetween electrostatic forces, excluded volume effects induced by core\ncollisions and steric effects leads to an unexpected reversal in the ionic\nselectivity of the pore with varying pore size: while large pores exhibits a\nhigher conductivity for large ions, narrow pores exclude large ions more\nefficiently than small ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 14:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 13:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
