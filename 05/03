We fit\nthe resulting total blazar spectral shape to the Fermi Large Area Telescope\nmeasurements of the EGB, finding that the best-fit shape reproduces well the\nshape of the Fermi EGB for various break scenarios. We conclude that a scenario\nin which the contribution of blazars is dominant cannot be excluded on spectral\ngrounds alone, even if spectral breaks are shown to be common among Fermi\nblazars. We also find that while the observation of a featureless (within\nuncertainties) power-law EGB spectrum by Fermi does not necessarily imply a\nsingle class of contributing unresolved sources with featureless individual\nspectra, such an observation and the collective spectra of the separate\ncontributing populations determine the ratios of their contributions.

In this review, we investigate\nthe accuracy of constrained models at the level of the equilibrium statistical\nmechanics distributions produced by the different dynamics. We carefully derive\nthe canonical equilibrium distributions of both the constrained and\nunconstrained dynamics, comparing the two of them by means of a \"stiff\"\napproximation to the latter. We do so both in the case of flexible and hard\nconstraints, i.e., when the value of the constrained coordinates depends on the\nconformation and when it is a constant number. We obtain the different\ncorrecting terms associated with the kinetic energy mass-metric tensor\ndeterminants, but also with the details of the potential energy in the vicinity\nof the constrained subspace (encoded in its first and second derivatives). This\nallows us to directly compare, at the conformational level, how the imposition\nof constraints changes the thermal equilibrium of molecular systems with\nrespect to the unconstrained case. We also provide an extensive review of the\nrelevant literature, and we show that all models previously reported can be\nconsidered special cases of the most general treatments presented in this work.\nFinally, we numerically analyze a simple methanol molecule in order to\nillustrate the theoretical concepts in a practical case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 16:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

The introduction of transformational optics has revitalized\nthis field by providing a general method to design material distributions to\nhide the subject from detection. By transforming space and light propagation, a\nthree-dimensional (3D) object is perceived as having a reduced number of\ndimensions, in the form of points, lines, and thin sheets, making it\n\"undetectable\" judging from the scattered field. Although a variety of cloaking\ndevices have been reported at microwave and optical frequencies, the\nspectroscopically important Terahertz (THz) domain remains unexplored.\nMoreover, due to the difficulties in fabricating cloaking devices that are\noptically large in all three dimensions, hiding realistic 3D objects has yet to\nbe demonstrated. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of a 3D\nTHz cloaking device fabricated using a scalable Projection\nMicrostereolithography process. The cloak operates at a broad frequency range\nbetween 0.3 and 0.6 THz, and is placed over an {\\alpha}- lactose monohydrate\nabsorber with rectangular shape.

Their topological order can be\nrealized at room temperatures without magnetic fields and they can be turned\ninto magnets and exotic superconductors leading to world-wide interest and\nactivity in topological insulators. One of the major challenges in going from\nquantum Hall-like 2D states to 3D topological insulators is to develop new\nexperimental approaches/methods to precisely probe this novel form of\ntopological-order since the standard tools and settings that work for IQH-state\nalso work for QSH states. The method to probe 2D topological-order is\nexclusively with charge transport, which either measures quantized transverse\nconductance plateaus in IQH systems or longitudinal conductance in quantum spin\nHall (QSH) systems. In a 3D topological insulator, the boundary itself supports\na two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and transport is not (Z$_2$)\ntopologically quantized.

An effective approach for Green Wireless\nCommunications is On-Demand strategy, which scales power consumption with the\nvolume and location of user demand. Applying the On-Demand Communications\nmodel, we propose a novel scheme -- Wireless Resource Trading, which\ncharacterizes the trading relationship among different wireless resources for a\ngiven number of performance metrics. According to wireless resource trading\nrelationship, different wireless resources can be consumed for the same set of\nperformance metrics.

The model includes the lower atmospheres\nat the two ends of the loop. The waves originate on small spatial scales (less\nthan 100 km) inside the kilogauss flux elements in the photosphere. The model\ndescribes the nonlinear interactions between Alfven waves using the reduced MHD\napproximation. The increase of Alfven speed with height in the chromosphere and\ntransition region (TR) causes strong wave reflection, which leads to\ncounter-propagating waves and turbulence in the photospheric and chromospheric\nparts of the flux tube. Part of the wave energy is transmitted through the TR\nand produces turbulence in the corona.

Beyond this, the force rapidly\nswitches over to attraction as the separation decreases further to zero, in\nline with the proximity force approximation. We demonstrate that this effect\ncan be understood as a competition between an increased repulsion due to a\nlarger polarizability of the central object interacting with increased fringing\nfields near the edge of the plate, and attractive forces due primarily to the\nnonzero thickness of the plate. In comparison with our previous work, we find\nthat using the same plate geometry but replacing the single cylinder with a\nring of cylinders, or more generally an extended uniaxial conductor, the\nrepulsive force can be enhanced by a factor of approximately $10^3$.

This noise is overcome when stacking clusters, as too\nare the effects of cluster asphericity and substructure, permitting a stringent\ntest of theoretical models. We derive a mean radial mass profile of four\nsimilar mass clusters of high-quality HST and Subaru images, in the range\nR=40kpc/h to 2800kpc/h, where the inner radial boundary is sufficiently large\nto avoid smoothing from miscentering effects. The stacked mass profile is\ndetected at 58-sigma significance over the entire radial range, with the\ncontribution from the cosmic noise included. We show that the projected mass\nprofile has a continuously steepening gradient out to beyond the virial radius,\nin remarkably good agreement with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White form\npredicted for the family of CDM-dominated halos in gravitational equilibrium.\nThe central slope is constrained to lie in the range,\n-dln{\\rho}/dln{r}=0.89^{+0.27}_{-0.39}. The mean concentration is\nc_{vir}=7.68^{+0.42}_{-0.40} (at a mean virial mass 1.54^{+0.11}_{-0.10}\\times\n10^{15} M_{sun}/h), which is high for relaxed, high-mass clusters, but\nconsistent with LCDM when a sizable projection bias estimated from N-body\nsimulations is considered. This possible tension will be more definitively\nexplored with new cluster surveys, such as CLASH, LoCuSS, Subaru HSC, and\nXXM-XXL, to construct the c-M relation over a wider mass range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 21:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2011 10:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among\nrandom mutations is an essential component of every evolutionary model and a\nmathematical portrait of robustness. Recent experiments on five viral species\nall revealed a characteristic bimodal shaped DFE, featuring peaks at neutrality\nand lethality. However, the phenotypic causes underlying observed fitness\neffects are still unknown, and presumably thought to vary unpredictably from\none mutation to another. By combining population genetics simulations with a\nsimple biophysical protein folding model, we show that protein thermodynamic\nstability accounts for a large fraction of observed mutational effects. We\nassume that moderately destabilizing mutations inflict a fitness penalty\nproportional to the reduction in folded protein, which depends continuously on\nfolding free energy (\\Delta G). Most mutations in our model affect fitness by\naltering \\Delta G, while, based on simple estimates, \\approx10% abolish\nactivity and are unconditionally lethal. Mutations pushing \\Delta G>0 are also\nconsidered lethal. Contrary to neutral network theory, we find that, in\nmutation/selection/drift steady-state, high mutation rates (m) lead to less\nstable proteins and a more dispersed DFE, i.e. less mutational robustness.\nSmall population size (N) also decreases stability and robustness. In our\nmodel, a continuum of non-lethal mutations reduces fitness by \\approx2% on\naverage, while \\approx10-35% of mutations are lethal, depending on N and m.\nCompensatory mutations are common in small populations with high mutation\nrates. More broadly, we conclude that interplay between biophysical and\npopulation genetic forces shapes the DFE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 22:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-04"}

The observations presented here show no strong evidence for TeV emission\nduring these orbital phases; however, during observations taken in late 2010,\nsignificant emission was detected from the source close to the phase of\nsuperior conjunction (much closer to periastron passage) at a 5.6 standard\ndeviation (5.6 sigma) post-trials significance.

In order to understand the origin of S0s\nin groups, we investigate numerically the morphological transformation of\nspirals into S0s through group-related physical processes. Our chemodynamical\nsimulations show that spirals in group environments can be strongly influenced\nby repetitive slow encounters with group member galaxies so that those with\nthin disks and prominent spiral arm structures can be transformed into S0s with\nthick disks and without prominent spiral arm structure. Such tidal interactions\ncan also trigger repetitive starbursts within the bulges of spirals and\nconsequently increase significantly the masses of their bulges. Owing to rapid\nconsumption of gas initially in spirals during the bulge growth, the S0s can\nbecome gas-poor. The S0s transformed from spirals in this way have young and\nmetal-rich stellar populations in the inner regions of their bulges. The\nsimulated S0s have lower maximum rotational velocities and flatter radial\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles in comparison to their progenitor\nspirals. The formation processes of S0s due to tidal interactions depend not\nonly on the masses and orbits of the progenitor spirals, but also on group\nmass. A significant fraction (10-30%) of stars and gas can be stripped during\nthis spiral to S0 morphological transformation so that intragroup stars and gas\ncan be formed. Based on these results, we discuss structures, kinematics,\nchemical properties, and the Tully-Fisher relation of S0s in groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 10:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Integrated effects have to be accounted for. A proper\ncalculation of the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation requires to estimate\nthe total irradiation from the whole XUV range. Aims: The purpose of this paper\nis to extend the analysis of the photoevaporation in planetary atmospheres from\nthe accessible X-rays to the mostly unobserved EUV range by using the coronal\nmodels of stars to calculate the EUV contribution to the stellar spectra. The\nmass evolution of planets can be traced assuming that thermal losses dominate\nthe mass loss of their atmospheres. Methods: We determine coronal models for 82\nstars with exoplanets that have X-ray observations available. Then a synthetic\nspectrum is produced for the whole XUV range (~1-912 {\\AA}). The determination\nof the EUV stellar flux, calibrated with real EUV data, allows us to calculate\nthe accumulated effects of the XUV irradiation on the planet atmosphere with\ntime, as well as the mass evolution for planets with known density. Results: We\ncalibrate for the first time a relation of the EUV luminosity with stellar age\nvalid for late-type stars. In a sample of 109 exoplanets, few planets with\nmasses larger than ~1.5 Mj receive high XUV flux, suggesting that intense\nphotoevaporation takes place in a short period of time, as previously found in\nX-rays. The scenario is also consistent with the observed distribution of\nplanet masses with density. The accumulated effects of photoevaporation over\ntime indicate that HD 209458b may have lost 0.2 Mj since an age of 20 Myr.\nConclusions: Coronal radiation produces rapid photoevaporation of the\natmospheres of planets close to young late-type stars.

Using\nour new dynamical approach, we find an upturn in the mass-loss vs. Gamma\ndependence, at the point where the winds become optically thick. This coincides\nwith the location where wind efficiency numbers surpass the single-scattering\nlimit of Eta = 1, reaching values up to Eta = 2.5. Our modelling suggests a\ntransition from common O-type winds to Wolf-Rayet characteristics at the point\nwhere the winds become optically thick. This transitional behaviour is also\nrevealed with respect to the wind acceleration parameter beta, which starts at\nvalues below 1 for the optically thin O-stars, and naturally reaches values as\nhigh as 1.5-2 for the optically thick Wolf-Rayet models. An additional finding\nconcerns the transition in spectral morphology of the Of and WN characteristic\nHe II line at 4686 Angstrom.

Generally, the\nnumber of spanning trees in a network can be obtained by computing a related\ndeterminant of the Laplacian matrix of the network.

In this paper, we develop a fairly generic technique for computing\ndeterminants corresponding to self-similar networks, thereby providing a method\nto determine the numbers of spanning trees in networks exhibiting\nself-similarity.

Thus far, the efficiency of a hub node\nsending information on scale-free small-world networks has not been addressed\nyet. In this paper, we study random walks on the class of Koch networks with\nscale-free behavior and small-world effect. We derive some basic properties for\nrandom walks on the Koch network family, based on which we calculate\nanalytically the partial mean first-passage time (PMFPT) defined as the average\nof MFPTs from a hub node to all other nodes, excluding the hub itself. The\nobtained closed-form expression displays that in large networks the PMFPT grows\nwith network order as $N \\ln N$, which is larger than the linear scaling of\nSMFPT to the hub from other nodes. On the other hand, we also address the case\nwith the information sender distributed uniformly among the Koch networks, and\nderive analytically the entire mean first-passage time (EMFPT), namely, the\naverage of MFPTs between all couples of nodes, the leading scaling of which is\nidentical to that of PMFPT. From the obtained results, we present that although\nhub nodes are more efficient for receiving information than other nodes, they\ndisplay a qualitatively similar speed for sending information as non-hub nodes.\nMoreover, we show that the location of information sender has little effect on\nthe transmission efficiency.

We correlate the relative number of\ndetected solar-like oscillators with stellar parameters from the {\\em Kepler\nInput Catalog} and find a deficiency for stars with effective temperatures in\nthe range $5300 \\lesssim T_\\mathrm{eff} \\lesssim 5700$\\,K and a drop-off in\ndetected oscillations in stars approaching the red edge of the classical\ninstability strip. We compare the power-law relationships between the frequency\nof peak power, $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$, the mean large frequency separation,\n$\\Delta\\nu$, and the maximum mode amplitude, $A_\\mathrm{max}$, and show that\nthere are significant method-dependent differences in the results obtained.\nThis illustrates the need for multiple complementary analysis methods to be\nused to assess the robustness and reproducibility of results derived from\nglobal asteroseismic parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 12:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-06"}

However, the underlying rationale of central place fractals in the\nreal world has not yet been revealed so far. This paper is devoted to\nillustrating the mechanisms by which the fractal patterns can be generated from\ncentral place systems. The structural dimension of the traditional central\nplace models is d=2 indicating no intermittency in the spatial distribution of\nhuman settlements. This dimension value is inconsistent with empirical\nobservations. Substituting the complete space filling with the incomplete space\nfilling, we can obtain central place models with fractional dimension D<d=2\nindicative of spatial intermittency. Thus the conventional central place models\nare converted into fractal central place models. If we further integrate the\nchance factors into the improved central place fractals, the theory will be\nable to well explain the real patterns of urban places. As empirical analyses,\nthe US cities and towns are employed to verify the fractal-based models of\ncentral places.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 14:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

The supersoft source (SSS) emission started between 21 and 30\nd after the optical outburst and ended between 60 and 120 d after outburst,\nmaking M31N 2007-12b one of the few novae with the shortest SSS phase known.\nThe X-ray spectrum was supersoft and can be fitted with a white dwarf (WD)\natmosphere model with solar abundances absorbed by the Galactic foreground. The\ntemperature of the WD atmosphere seems to increase at the beginning of the SSS\nphase from ~70 to ~80 eV. The luminosity of M31N 2007-12b during maximum was at\nthe Eddington limit of a massive WD and dropped by ~30% in the observation 60 d\nafter outburst. The radius of the emission region is ~6x10^8 cm. In the four\nbright state observations, we detected a stable 1110 s pulsation, which we\ninterpret as the WD rotation period. In addition, we detect dips in three\nobservations that might represent a 4.9 h or 9.8 h binary period of the system.\nNova envelope models with <50% mixing between solar-like accreted material and\nthe degenerate core of the WD can be used to describe the data. We derive a WD\nmass of 1.2 Msun, as well as an ejected and burned mass of 2.0x10^{-6} Msun}\nand 0.2x10^{-6} Msun, respectively. The observed periodicities indicate that\nnova M31N 2007-12b erupted in an intermediate polar (IP) system.

X-ray observations of\nmassive nearby elliptical galaxies, including M87 in the Virgo cluster,\nindicate a Bondi accretion rate Mdot which roughly matches the total kinetic\npower of the jets, suggesting that there is a tight coupling between the jet\npower and the mass accretion rate. While the Bondi model considers non-rotating\ngas, it is likely that the external gas has some angular momentum, which\nprevious studies have shown could decrease the accretion rate drastically. We\ninvestigate here the possibility that viscosity acts at all radii to transport\nangular momentum outward so that the accretion inflow proceeds rapidly and\nsteadily. The situation corresponds to a giant Advection Dominated Accretion\nFlow (ADAF) which extends from beyond the Bondi radius down to the black hole.\nWe find solutions of the ADAF equations in which the gas accretes at just a\nfactor of a few less than Mdot. These solutions assume that the atmosphere\nbeyond the Bondi radius rotates with a sub-Keplerian velocity and that the\nviscosity parameter is large, alpha~0.1. The infall time of the ADAF solutions\nis no more than a few times the free-fall time. Thus the accretion rate at the\nblack hole is closely coupled to the surrounding gas, enabling tight feedback\nto occur. We show that jet powers of a few per cent of Mdot c^2 are expected if\neither a fraction of the accretion power is channeled into the jet or the black\nhole spin energy is tapped by a strong magnetic field pressed against the black\nhole by the pressure of the accretion flow.(Truncated)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 14:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

One of\nthe key goals of BOSS is to measure the signature of baryon acoustic\noscillations in the distribution of Ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of a\nsample of ~150,000 z>2.2 quasars. Along with measuring the angular diameter\ndistance at z\\approx2.5, BOSS will provide the first direct measurement of the\nexpansion rate of the Universe at z > 2. One of the biggest challenges in\nachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over\n2.2 < z < 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. During the first year\nof the BOSS survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and tested\nto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in this\nredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. To achieve these surface densities,\nthe magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g <= 22.0 or r<=21.85.\nWhile detection of the BAO signature in the Ly-alpha absorption in quasar\nspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysical\nstudies do. We therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targets\ndeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. This \"CORE\"\nsubsample will be fixed for Years Two through Five of the survey. In this paper\nwe describe the evolution and implementation of the BOSS quasar target\nselection algorithms during the first two years of BOSS operations. We analyze\nthe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z>2.2 quasars were\nspectroscopically confirmed by BOSS. Our current algorithms select an average\nof 15 z > 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch SDSS\nimaging. Multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can further\nimprove the efficiency and completeness of BOSS quasar target selection.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 15:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

For disordered potentials, the Schr\\\"odinger-like equation\naccounts for the scattering and localization properties of the Bogoliubov\nquasiparticles. We derive analytically the localization lengths for correlated\ndisordered potentials in the one-dimensional geometry. Our approach relies on a\nperturbative expansion in $V/\\mu$, which we develop up to third order, and we\ndiscuss the impact of the various perturbation orders. Our predictions are\nshown to be in very good agreement with direct numerical calculations. We\nidentify different localization regimes: For low energy, the effective\ndisordered potential exhibits a strong screening by the quasicondensate density\nbackground, and localization is suppressed. For high-energy excitations, the\neffective disordered potential reduces to the bare disordered potential, and\nthe localization properties of quasiparticles are the same as for free\nparticles.

The superposition of the plane wave and the\nD3-branes is 1/4 BPS. The near horizon geometry of this configuration is a\n5-dimensional z=0 Schroedinger space-time times a 5-sphere.

Upon compactification along the direction in which the wave is\ntraveling the 5-dimensional z=0 Schroedinger space-time reduces to a\n4-dimensional z=2 Lifshitz space-time. The compactification is such that the\ncircle is small for weakly coupled type IIB string theory. This reduction\nbreaks the supersymmetries.
