The colored Tverberg\ntheorem corresponds to graphs constructed as disjoint unions of small complete\ngraphs.

These anisotropies have been measured by a number of experiments,\nfrom the far-infrared to the millimeter. One of the main impediments to an\naccurate measurement on large scales is the contamination of the foreground\nsignal by Galactic dust emission. Our goal is to show that we can remove the\nGalactic cirrus contamination using HI data, and thus accurately measure the\nclustering of starburst galaxies in the CIB. We use observations of the ELAIS\nN1 field at far-infrared (100 and 160{\\mu}m) and radio (21 cm) wavelengths. We\ncompute the correlation between dust emission, traced by far-infrared\nobservations, and HI gas traced by 21cm observations, and derive dust\nemissivities that enable us to subtract the cirrus emission from the\nfar-infrared maps. We then derive the power spectrum of the CIB anisotropies,\nas well as its mean level at 100{\\mu}m and 160{\\mu}m. We also combine the HI\ndata and Spitzer total power mode absolute measurements to determine the CIB\nmean level at 160{\\mu}m.

This measurement is in line with\nvalues obtained with recent models of infrared galaxy evolution and\nHerschel/PACS data, but is much smaller than the previous DIRBE measurements.\nThe use of high-angular resolution Hi data is mandatory to accurately\ndifferentiate the cirrus from the CIB emission. The 100 {\\mu}m IRAS map (and\nthus the map developed by Schlegel and collaborators) in such extragalactic\nfields is highly contaminated by the CIB anisotropies and hence cannot be used\nas a Galactic cirrus tracer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2011 16:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 09:10:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2012 20:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-11"}

The discrete maximum principles are established by\nassuming a property on the discrete variational form that is of global nature.\nIn particular, the assumption on the variational form is verified when the\nfinite element partition satisfies some angle conditions.

We first run a simulation without pulsar\nwind nor Be wind, taking into account only the gravitational effect of the\npulsar on the Be disk. In this simulation, the gas particles are ejected at a\nconstant rate from the equatorial surface of the Be star, which is tilted in a\ndirection consistent with multi-waveband observations. We run the simulation\nuntil the Be disk is fully developed and starts to repeat a regular tidal\ninteraction with the pulsar. Then, we turn on the pulsar wind and the Be wind.\nWe run two simulations with different wind mass-loss rates for the Be star, one\nfor a B2V type and the other for a significantly earlier spectral type.\nAlthough the global shape of the interaction surface between the pulsar wind\nand the Be wind agrees with the analytical solution, the effect of the pulsar\nwind on the Be disk is profound. The pulsar wind strips off an outer part of\nthe Be disk, truncating the disk at a radius significantly smaller than the\npulsar orbit. Our results, therefore, rule out the idea that the pulsar passes\nthrough the Be disk around periastron, which has been assumed in the previous\nstudies. It also turns out that the location of the contact discontinuity can\nbe significantly different between phases when the pulsar wind directly hits\nthe Be disk and those when the pulsar wind collides with the Be wind.

In the multi-cluster invasion regime, rapid\nenvironmental variation produced spatial mixing of the species and\nnon-equilibrium coexistence. The dynamics' dominant response effectively\naveraged environmental fluctuation, so that each species could avoid\ncompetitive exclusion. Increasing the environment's half-period to match the\npopulation-dynamic timescale let the (initially) more abundant resident\nrepeatedly repel the invader.

The set Z is said to\nbe a zero forcing set of G if all vertices of G will be turned black after\nfinitely many applications of the color-change rule. The zero forcing number of\nG is the minimum of |Z| over all zero forcing sets Z \\subseteq V (G). Zero\nforcing parameters have been studied and applied to the minimum rank problem\nfor graphs in numerous articles. We define the iteration index of a zero\nforcing set of a graph G to be the number of (global) applications of the\ncolor-change rule required to turn all vertices of G black; this leads to a new\ngraph invariant, the iteration index of G - it is the minimum of iteration\nindices of all minimum zero forcing sets of G. We present some basic properties\nof the iteration index and discuss some preliminary results on certain graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2011 06:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We argue that both these observations may have an\nexplanation within the unified framework of a Quark-Nova occurring in a\nlow-mass X-ray binary (neutron star- white dwarf). For LMXBs where the binary\nseparation is sufficiently tight, ejecta from the exploding Neutron Star\ntriggers nuclear burning in the white dwarf on impact, possibly leading to\nFe-rich composition compact white dwarfs with mass 0.43M_sun < M_WD <\n0.72M_sun, reminiscent of G87-7. Our results rely on the assumption, which\nultimately needs to be tested by hydrodynamic and nucleosynthesis simulations,\nthat under certain circumstances the WD can avoid the thermonuclear runaway.\nFor heavier white dwarfs (i.e. M_WD > 0.72M_sun) experiencing the QN shock,\ndegeneracy will not be lifted when Carbon burning begins, and a\nsub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia Supernovae may result in our model. Under slightly\ndifferent conditions, and for pure He white dwarfs (i.e. M_WD < 0.43M_sun), the\nwhite dwarf is ablated and its ashes raining down on the Quark star leads to\naccretion-driven X-ray luminosity with energetics and duration reminiscent of\nGRB 110328A.

In the\nperturbative regime of the magnetic theory the existence of a very large number\nof fixed points is unveiled. We classify them by analyzing their basin of\nattraction. The existence of several nonsupersymmetric fixed points for the\nmagnetic gauge theory lends further support towards the existence of\ngauge-gauge duality beyond supersymmetry. We also discover that among these\nvery many fixed points there are supersymmetric ones emerging from a generic\nnonsupersymmetric renormalization group flow. We therefore conclude that\nsupersymmetry naturally emerges as a fixed point theory from a\nnonsupersymmetric Lagrangian without the need for fine-tuning of the bare\ncouplings. Our results suggest that supersymmetry can be viewed as an emergent\nphenomenon in field theory. In particular there should be no need for\nfine-tuning the bare couplings when performing Lattice simulations aimed to\ninvestigate supersymmetry on the Lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2011 12:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-10"}
