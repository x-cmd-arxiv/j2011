In contrast, the\nstatistically-bounded delay with a small violation probability has been widely\nused for delay quality-of-service (QoS) characterization and evaluation. While\nexisting research mainly focused on the statistical-delay control in single-hop\nlinks, in this paper we propose the QoS-driven power-allocation scheme over\ntwo-hop wireless relay links to statistically upper-bound the end-to-end delay\nunder the decodeand- forward (DF) relay transmissions. Specifically, by\napplying the effective capacity and effective bandwidth theories, we first\nanalyze the delay-bound violation probability over two tops each with\nindependent service processes. Then, we show that an efficient approach for\nstatistical-delay guarantees is to make the delay distributions of both hops\nidentical, which, however, needs to be obtained through asymmetric resource\nallocations over the two hops. Motivated by this fact, we formulate and solve\nan optimization problem aiming at minimizing the average power consumptions to\nsatisfy the specified end-to-end delay-bound violation probability over two-hop\nrelay links. Also conducted is a set of simulations results to show the impact\nof the QoS requirements, traffic load, and position of the relay node on the\npower allocation under our proposed optimal scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2011 17:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-03"}

The main results\nfollow. (1) We attempted to recover a spectrum of the companion by\ndisentangling the observed spectra of the eps Aur binary failed, but we were\nable to disentangle the spectrum of telluric lines and obtain a mean spectrum\nof the F-type primary star. The latter was then compared to a grid of synthetic\nspectra for a number of plausible values of T(eff) and log(g), but a reasonably\ngood match was not found. However, we conclude that the observed spectrum is\nthat of a low-gravity star. (2) We examined changes in the complex H-alpha line\nprofiles over the past 16 years, with particular emphasis on the 2009-2011\neclipse period, by subtracting a mean out-of-eclipse H-alpha profile\n(appropriately shifted in radial velocity) from the observed spectra. We find\nthat the dark disk around the unseen companion has an extended 'atmosphere'\nthat manifests itself via blueshifted and redshifted H-alpha 'shell'\nabsorptions seen projected against the F star. Significantly, the H-alpha shell\nline first appeared three years before first contact of the optical eclipse\nwhen the system was not far past maximum separation. (3) Analyses of radial\nvelocities and central intensities of several strong, unblended spectral lines,\nas well as UBV photometry, demonstrated that these observables showed apparent\nmultiperiodic variability during eclipse. The dominant period of 66.21 was\ncommon to all the observables, but with different phase shifts between these\nvariables. This result strongly supports our earlier suggestion that the\nphotometric variability seen during eclipse is intrinsic to the F star, and\ntherefore, the idea of a central brightening due to a hole in the disk should\nbe abandoned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2011 18:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The star has revealed an absolute maximum of visual brightness\n(1992-1994, high/cold state) and an absolute minimum (2007-2008, low/hot\nstate). The variability of the spectrum of V532 is fully consistent with the\ntemperature variations in its photosphere, while both permitted and forbidden\nlines are formed in an extended stellar atmosphere. Broad components of the\nbrightest lines were found, the broadening of these components is due to\nelectron scattering in the wind parts closest to the photosphere. The wind\nvelocity clearly depends on the size of the stellar photosphere or on the\nvisual brightness, when brightness declines, the wind velocity increases. In\nthe absolute minimum a kinematic profile of the V532 atmosphere was detected.\nThe wind velocity increases and its temperature declines with distance from the\nstar.

We discuss a\nnumber of CR-driven, magnetic field amplification processes that are likely to\noperate when diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) becomes efficient and\nnonlinear. The turbulent magnetic fields produced by these processes determine\nthe maximum energies of accelerated particles and result in specific features\nin the observed photon radiation of the sources. Equally important, magnetic\nfield amplification by the CR currents and pressure anisotropies may affect the\nshocked gas temperatures and compression, both in the shock precursor and in\nthe downstream flow, if the shock is an efficient CR accelerator. Strong\nfluctuations of the magnetic field on scales above the radiation formation\nlength in the shock vicinity result in intermittent structures observable in\nsynchrotron emission images. Resonant and non-resonant CR streaming\ninstabilities in the shock precursor can generate mesoscale magnetic fields\nwith scale-sizes comparable to supernova remnants and even superbubbles. This\nopens the possibility that magnetic fields in the earliest galaxies were\nproduced by the first generation Population III supernova remnants and by\nclustered supernovae in star forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2011 01:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-09"}

This is because in nanoscale systems crystallographically perfect\ncrystallites paradoxically result in nonstoichiometric compositions owing to\nthe finite number of constituting atoms. In these structurally perfect but\nstoichiometrically imperfect nanocrystallites, the spin-triplet state is found\nto be more stable than the spin-singlet state, giving rise to an extended spin\ndistribution that expands over the entire crystal. According to this picture,\nlong-range magnetic order arises from the combined effect of crystal symmetry\nand nonstoichiometry that can coexist exclusively in nanoscale systems. The\nidea can also give reasonable explanations for the unprecedented ferromagnetic\nfeatures observed commonly in nanoscale oxides, including ubiquity, anisotropy,\nand diluteness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2011 13:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-25"}

We consider the largest lattices to date, in\nan attempt to keep systematic errors under control. Electric and magnetic\nscreening masses are calculated through an Ansatz from the zero-temperature\ncase, based on complex-conjugate poles for the momentum-space propagators. As\nrecently reported in [1], we find good fits to the proposed form at all\ntemperatures considered, with different ratios of real to imaginary part of the\npole masses for the longitudinal (electric) and transverse (magnetic)\npropagators. The behavior of the magnetic propagator D_T(p) is in agreement\nwith the dimensional-reduction picture, showing infrared suppression (with a\nturnover in momentum) and violation of spectral positivity at all nonzero\ntemperatures considered. The longitudinal propagator D_L(p) appears to reach a\nplateau at small momenta and is subject to severe finite-Nt effects around the\ncritical temperature Tc. As a consequence, only lattices with temporal extent\nNt > 8 seem to be free from systematic errors. After these errors are removed,\nthe infrared-plateau value is considerably reduced around the transition and\nthe sharp peak observed previously for this quantity at Tc is no longer\npresent. The resulting infrared behavior for D_L(p) at Tc is essentially the\nsame as for 0.5Tc . An investigation of the temperature range between 0.5Tc and\nTc reveals that a less pronounced (finite) peak may occur at smaller\ntemperatures, e.g. T ~ 0.9Tc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2011 15:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-14"}
