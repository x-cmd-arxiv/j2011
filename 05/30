Furthermore, the predictive motifs\nrobustly selected by the learning algorithm are found to show strong\nhost-specificity and occur in highly conserved regions of the viral proteome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2011 19:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In contrast, the role of minor mergers in the formation of these\ninner components (ICs), while often invoked, is still poorly understood. We\nhave investigated the capability of minor mergers to trigger the formation of\nIDs and IRs in spiral galaxies through collisionless N-body simulations. We\nhave run a battery of minor mergers in which both primary and secondary are\nmodelled as disc-bulge-halo galaxies with realistic density ratios. A detailed\nanalysis of the morphology, structure, and kinematics of the ICs resulting from\nthe minor merger has been carried out. All the simulated minor mergers develop\nthin ICs out of satellite material, supported by rotation. A wide morphological\nzoo of ICs has been obtained (including IDs, IRs, pseudo-rings, nested IDs,\nspiral patterns, and combinations of them), but all with structural and\nkinematical properties similar to observations. The existence of the resulting\nICs can be deduced through the features that they imprint in the isophotal\nprofiles and kinemetric maps of the final remnant, as in many real galaxies.\nThe realistic density ratios used in the present models make the satellites to\nexperience more efficient orbital circularization and disruption than in\nprevious studies. Combined with the disc resonances induced by the encounter,\nthese processes give place to highly aligned co- and counter-rotating ICs in\nthe remnant centre. Therefore, minor mergers are an efficient mechanism to form\nrotationally-supported stellar ICs in spiral galaxies, neither requiring strong\ndissipation nor the development of noticeable bars (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2011 21:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Using high resolution images of SQ\nin B438, V606, and I814 bands from the Early Release Science project obtained\nwith the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope, we identify 496\nstar cluster candidates (SCCs), located throughout the galaxies themselves as\nwell as in intergalactic regions. Our photometry goes \\sim2 mag deeper and\ncovers an additional three regions, the Old Tail, NGC 7317, and the Southern\nDebris Region, compared to previous work. Through comparison of the B438 - V606\nand V606 - I814 colors of the star cluster candidates with simple stellar\npopulation synthesis models we are able to constrain cluster ages. In\nparticular, the most massive galaxy of SQ, NGC 7319, exhibits continuous star\nformation throughout its history, although at a lower rate over the past few\ntens of Myr. NGC 7318 A/B and the Northern Star Burst region both show ongoing\nactive star formation; there are a number of star clusters that are younger\nthan 10 Myr. NGC 7318 A/B also features a peculiar gap in the color\ndistribution of the star clusters that can be used to date the onset of the\nrecent burst. The majority of the SCCs detected in the Young Tail were formed\n150-200 Myr ago whereas the tight distribution of star cluster colors in the\nOld Tail, allow us to constrain its age of formation to \\sim400 Myr ago. The\nstar clusters in the Southern Debris region are seemingly divided into two\ngroups with ages of 50 and \\sim500 Myr and virtually all of the SCCs detected\nin NGC 7317 are over 2 Gyr old. Based on these ages, we estimate time intervals\nfor the interactions between SQ members that triggered the massive star cluster\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2011 23:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Based on N-body simulations and chemical\nevolution models, we investigate the radial metallicity gradient, structural\nand kinematical properties, and detailed chemical abundance patterns of the\nthick disk. Our numerical simulations show that the ancient minor merger event\ncan significantly flatten the original radial metallicity gradient of the FGTD,\nin particular, in the outer part, and also can be responsible for migration of\ninner metal-rich stars into the outer part (R>10kpc).

However, just adjacent to this sharp transition, the\nradio flux increases. This radio limb-brightening is observed over at least\nhalf of the perimeter of both lobes. We describe slowly propagating steady\nstate diffusion fronts that explain these counterintuitive features. Because of\nthe natural buoyancy of radio lobes, the magnetic field is largely tangent to\nthe lobe boundary, an alignment that polarizes the radio emission and\ndramatically reduces the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. As\ncosmic ray electrons diffuse slowly into the cluster gas, the local magnetic\nfield and gas density are reduced as gas flows back toward the radio lobe.\nRadio emission peaks can occur because the synchrotron emissivity increases\nwith magnetic field and then decreases with the density of non-thermal\nelectrons. A detailed comparison of steady diffusion fronts with quantitative\nradio observations may reveal information about the spatial variation of\nmagnetic fields and the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. On\nlarger scales, some reduction of the gas density inside the Virgo lobes due to\ncosmic ray pressure must occur and may be measurable.

In this\npaper we study the effects of primordial mass segregation and the importance of\nthe stellar initial mass function (IMF) on the runaway growth of VMSs using a\ndynamical Monte Carlo code for N-body systems with N as high as 10^6 stars. Our\ncode now includes an explicit treatment of all stellar collisions. We place\nspecial emphasis on the possibility of top-heavy IMFs, as observed in some very\nyoung massive clusters. We find that both primordial mass segregation and the\nshape of the IMF affect the rate of core collapse of star clusters and thus the\ntime of the runaway. When we include primordial mass segregation we generally\nsee a decrease in core collapse time (tcc). Moreover, primordial mass\nsegregation increases the average mass in the core, thus reducing the central\nrelaxation time, which also decreases tcc. The final mass of the VMS formed is\nalways close to \\sim 10^-3 of the total cluster mass, in agreement with the\nprevious studies and is reminiscent of the observed correlation between the\ncentral black hole mass and the bulge mass of the galaxies. As the degree of\nprimordial mass segregation is increased, the mass of the VMS increases at most\nby a factor of 3. Flatter IMFs generally increase the average mass in the whole\ncluster, which increases tcc. For the range of IMFs investigated in this paper,\nthis increase in tcc is to some degree balanced by stellar collisions, which\naccelerate core collapse. Thus there is no significant change in tcc for the\nsomewhat flatter global IMFs observed in very young massive clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 07:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 04:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

These relatively\nlarge length scales are because of the weak destabilizing van der Waals forces\nand the high surface energy penalty required for deformations on small scales.\nWe show a simple, one-step versatile method to fabricate sub-micron (>~100 nm)\ndroplets and their ordered arrays by room temperature dewetting of ultrathin\npolystyrene (PS) films by minimizing these limitations. This is achieved by\ncontrolled room temperature dewetting under an optimal mixture of water,\nacetone and methyl-ethyl ketone (MEK). Diffusion of organic solvents in the\nfilm greatly reduces its glass transition temperature and the interfacial\ntension, but enhances the destabilizing field by introduction of electrostatic\nforce. The latter is reflected in a change in the exponent, n of the\ninstability length scale, {\\lambda} ~h^n, where h is the film thickness and n =\n1.51 \\pm 0.06 in the case of water-solvent mix, as opposed to its value of 2.19\n\\pm 0.07 for dewetting in air. The net outcome is more than one order of\nmagnitude reduction in the droplet size as well as their mean separation and\nalso a much faster dynamics of dewetting. We also demonstrate the use of this\ntechnique for controlled dewetting on topographically patterned substrates with\nsubmicrometer features where dewetting in air is either arrested, incomplete or\nunable to produce ordered patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 12:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-06"}

In the Gaussian case, we characterize the capacity region for the\nmodel with individual message as well. Our converse proof in this case shows\nthat, for this model, strictly causal knowledge of the state at one of the\nencoders does not increase capacity if the other is informed non-causally, a\nresult which sheds more light on the utility of conveying a compressed version\nof the state to the decoder in recent results by Lapidoth and Steinberg on a\nmultiacess model with only strictly causal state at both encoders and\nindependent messages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 12:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

First\nthe holographic description of the anomalous \\gamma^*\\gamma^*\\pi^0 form factor\nis reviewed and applied to various models. It is illustrated that in describing\nthe anomalous form factor, the holographic approach is asymptotically dual to\nthe perturbative QCD (pQCD) framework, with the pion mode \\pi(z)\\sim z\ncorresponding to the asymptotic pion distribution amplitude. This indicates\nsome inconsistency in light-front holography, since \\pi(z)\\sim z would be dual\nto \\varphi(x)\\sim \\sqrt{x(1-x)} there. After clarifying these subtleties, we\nemploy the relation between the holographic and the perturbative expressions to\nstudy possible asymptotic violation of the transition form factor. It is found\nthat if one require that the asymptotic form factor possess a pQCD-like\nexpression, the pion mode can only be ultraviolet-enhanced by logarithmic\nfactors. The minimally deformed pion mode will then be of the form \\pi(z)\\sim\nz\\ln (z\\Lambda)^{-1}. We suppose that this deformation may be due to the\ncoupling of the pion with a nontrivial open string tachyon field, and then the\nparameter $\\Lambda$ will be related to the quark condensate. Interestingly,\nthis pion mode leads immediately to Radyushkin's logarithmic model, which\nfitted very well the experimental data in the large-Q^2 region. On the other\nside, the pQCD interpretation with a flat-like pion distribution amplitude,\nproposed by Radyushkin and Polyakov, fails to possess a holographic expression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 14:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 13:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-01"}

The novelty of this work is that instead of\nempirically selecting the parameters of the neural network, i.e. the learning\nrate, activation function parameter, momentum number, the number of nodes in\none layer, etc. we developed a strategy that can automatically select\ncomparatively better combination of these parameters. We also introduce another\nway to perform back propagation. Instead of using the partial differential of\nthe error function, we use optimal algorithm; namely Powell's direction set to\nminimize the error function. We were also interested in construction an\nauthentic emotion databases. This is a very important task because nowadays\nthere is no such database available. Finally, we perform several experiments\nand show that our neural network approach can be successfully used for emotion\nrecognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2011 15:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-31"}
