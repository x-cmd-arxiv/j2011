We conclude the\ndiscussion by applying our analytical method to 3 case examples of superlensing\nfrom the literature.

For\nparticles, only the variables that describe the shapes of the instantaneous\nparticle configurations are dynamical. In the case of Riemannian\nthree-geometries, the only dynamical variables are the parts of the metric that\ndetermine angles. The local scale factor plays no role. This leads to a\nshape-dynamic theory of gravity in which the four-dimensional diffeomorphism\ninvariance of general relativity is replaced by three-dimensional\ndiffeomorphism invariance and three-dimensional conformal invariance. Despite\nthis difference of symmetry groups, it is remarkable that the predictions of\nthe two theories -- shape dynamics and general relativity -- agree on spacetime\nfoliations by hypersurfaces of constant mean extrinsic curvature. However, the\ntwo theories are distinct, with shape dynamics having a much more restrictive\nset of solutions. There are indications that the symmetry group of shape\ndynamics makes it more amenable to quantization and thus to the creation of\nquantum gravity.

I propose that theories of ionic solutions\nshould start with the theory of complex fluids because that theory is designed\nto deal with interactions from the beginning. The variational theory of complex\nfluids is particularly well suited to describe mixtures like the solutions in\nand outside biological cells.

If the\nmetric becomes degenerate (as in singular semi-Riemannian geometry), these\nconstructions no longer work, because they are based on the inverse of the\nmetric, and on related operations like the contraction between covariant\nindices. In this article we develop the geometry of singular semi-Riemannian\nmanifolds. First, we introduce an invariant and canonical contraction between\ncovariant indices, applicable even for degenerate metrics. This contraction\napplies to a special type of tensor fields, which are radical-annihilator in\nthe contracted indices. Then, we use this contraction and the Koszul form to\ndefine the covariant derivative for radical-annihilator indices of covariant\ntensor fields, on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds named\nradical-stationary. We use this covariant derivative to construct the Riemann\ncurvature, and show that on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds,\nnamed semi-regular, the Riemann curvature is smooth. We apply these results to\nconstruct a version of Einstein's tensor whose density of weight 2 remains\nsmooth even in the presence of semi-regular singularities. We can thus write a\ndensitized version of Einstein's equation, which is smooth, and which is\nequivalent to the standard Einstein equation if the metric is non-degenerate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2011 20:38:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 15:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

However, the stabilisation affects the eigenmodes that\nwe wish to remain as close to Model S as possible. In a bid to recover the\nModel S eigenmodes, we choose to make additional corrections to the sound speed\nof Model S before stabilisation. No stabilised model can be perfectly\nsolar-like, so we present three stabilised models with slightly different\neigenmodes. The models are appropriate to study the f and p1 to p4 modes with\nspherical harmonic degrees in the range from 400 to 900. Background model CSM\nhas a modified pressure gradient for stabilisation and has eigenfrequencies\nwithin 2% of Model S. Model CSM_A has an additional 10% increase in sound speed\nin the top 1 Mm resulting in eigenfrequencies within 2% of Model S and\neigenfunctions that are, in comparison with CSM, closest to those of Model S.\nModel CSM_B has a 3% decrease in sound speed in the top 5 Mm resulting in\neigenfrequencies within 1% of Model S and eigenfunctions that are only\nmarginally adversely affected. These models are useful to study the interaction\nof solar waves with embedded three-dimensional heterogeneities, such as\nconvective flows and model sunspots. We have also calculated the response of\nthe stabilised models to excitation by random near-surface sources, using\nsimulations of the propagation of linear waves.

Indeed, for such nonlinear SDEs the classical Monte\nCarlo Euler method has been shown to converge by exploiting that the Euler\napproximations diverge only on events whose probabilities decay to zero very\nrapidly. Significantly more efficient than the classical Monte Carlo Euler\nmethod is the recently introduced multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method. The main\nobservation of this article is that this multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method\ndoes - in contrast to classical Monte Carlo methods - not converge in general\nin the case of such nonlinear SDEs.

The most important secular parameters are the forced\neccentricity and secular frequency, which depend on the initial conditions of\nthe particles, as well as on the mass and orbital parameters of the secondary\nstar. We construct a second-order theory (with respect to the masses) for the\nplanar secular motion of small planetasimals and deduce new expressions for the\nforced eccentricity and secular frequency. We also reanalyze the radial\nvelocity data available for Gamma-Cephei and present a series of orbital\nsolutions leading to residuals compatible with the best fits. Finally, we\ndiscuss how different orbital configurations for Gamma-Cephei may affect the\ndynamics of small bodies in circunmstellar motion. For Gamma-Cephei, we find\nthat the classical first-order expressions for the secular frequency and forced\neccentricity lead to large inaccuracies around 50 % for semimajor axes larger\nthan one tenth the orbital separation between the stellar components. Low\neccentricities and/or masses reduce the importance of the second-order terms.\nThe dynamics of small planetesimals only show a weak dependence with the\norbital fits of the stellar components, and the same result is found including\nthe effects of a nonlinear gas drag. Thus, the possibility of planetary\nformation in this binary system largely appears insensitive to the orbital fits\nadopted for the stellar components, and any future alterations in the system\nparameters (due to new observations) should not change this picture. Finally,\nwe show that planetesimals migrating because of gas drag may be trapped in\nmean-motion resonances with the binary, even though the migration is divergent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 05:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-03"}

Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to\nexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay\nphases around the flare maxima.

Degree is one of straightforward\nmeasures to characterize the vitality of a vertex in maintaining the integrity\nof the network but not the only one. Damage, the decrease of the largest\ncomponent size that was caused by the removal of a vertex, intuitively is a\nmore destructive guide for intentional attack on networks since the network\nfunctionality is usually measured by the largest component size. However, it is\nsurprising to find that little is known about behaviors of real networks or\nsynthetic networks against intentional attack guided by damage (damage attack),\nin which adversaries always choose the vertex with the largest damage to\nattack.\n  In this article, we dedicate our efforts to understanding damage attack and\nbehaviors of real networks as well as synthetic networks against this attack.\nTo this end, existing attacking models, statistical properties of damage in\ncomplex networks are first revisited. Then, we present the empirical analysis\nresults about behaviors of complex networks against damage attack with the\ncomparisons to degree attack. It is surprising to find a cross-point for\ndiverse networks before which damage attack is more destructive than degree\nattack. Further investigation shows that the existence of cross-point can be\nattributed to the fact that: degree attack tends produce networks with more\nheterogenous damage distribution than damage attack. Results in this article\nstrongly suggest that damage attack is one of most destructive attacks and\ndeserves our research efforts.Our understandings about damage attack may also\nshed light on efficient solutions to protect real networks against damage\nattack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 09:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 11:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 01:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-26"}

The need to use these hybrid knowledge bases in dynamic domains has\ncalled for the development of update operators, which, given the substantially\ndifferent way Description Logics and rules are usually updated, has turned out\nto be an extremely difficult task.\n  In [SL10], a first step towards addressing this problem was taken, and an\nupdate operator for hybrid knowledge bases was proposed.

Recently, the all-reflective coupling of two\ncavities with a low-efficiency 3-port diffraction grating was theoretically\ninvestigated. Such a grating has an additional (a third) port. However, it was\nshown that the additional port does not necessarily decrease the bandwidth of\nthe coupled cavities.

This model has a jamming or yielding phase\ntransition, around which power-law or Andrade creep is found. During primary\ncreep, the relative strength of the strain rate fluctuations increases with\ntime in both cases - the spatially averaged creep rate obeys the Andrade law\n$\\epsilon_t \\sim t^{-0.7}$, while the time dependence of the spatial\nfluctuations of the local creep rates is given by $\\Delta \\epsilon_t \\sim\nt^{-0.5}$. A similar scaling for the fluctuations is found in the logarithmic\ncreep regime that is typically observed for lower applied stresses. We review\nbriefly some classical theories of Andrade creep from the point of view of such\nspatial fluctuations. We consider these phenomenological, time-dependent creep\nlaws in terms of a description based on a non-equilibrium phase transition\nseparating evolving and frozen states of the system when the externally applied\nload is varied. Such an interpretation is discussed further by the data\ncollapse of the local deformations in the spirit of absorbing state/depinning\nphase transitions, as well as deformation-deformation correlations and the\nwidth of the cumulative strain distributions. The results are also compared\nwith the order parameter fluctuations observed close to the depinning\ntransition of the 2$d$ Linear Interface Model or the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson\nequation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 13:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Our detailed models derive the chromospheric structure\nusing the Ca II and H$\\alpha$, and simulate the corresponding He I 10830 line\nprofiles. We show that, at a given value of He abundance, the He I 10830\nequivalent width cannot significantly change without a corresponding much\nlarger change in the Ca II lines. We have used the VLT-CRIRES to obtain\nhigh-resolution spectra in the 10830 {\\AA} region, and the VLT-UVES to obtain\nspectra of the Ca II and H$\\alpha$ lines of our target stars.

This is possible if the\nmassive AGBs of [Fe/H]>-1.3 in the progenitor system evolve when all the\npristine gas surrounding the cluster has been exhausted by the previous star\nformation events, or the proto--cluster interaction with the Galaxy caused the\nloss of a significant fraction of its mass, or of its dark matter halo, and the\nsupernova ejecta have been able to clear the gas out of the system. The absence\nof dilution in the metal richer populations lends further support to a scenario\nof the formation of second generation stars in cooling flows from massive AGB\nprogenitors. We suggest that the entire formation of omega Cen took place in a\nfew 10^8yr, and discuss the problem of a prompt formation of s--process\nelements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 15:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Thanks to the\nastrophysical application of high spectral resolution detectors, it was soon\nclear that this radiation was due to the 511 keV photons generated by\nelectron-positron annihilation. Even though the physical process are known, the\nastrophysical origin of this radiation is still a mystery. The spectrometer SPI\naboard the INTEGRAL gamma-ray satellite has been used to produce the first\nall-sky map in light of the 511 keV annihilation, but no direct evidence for\n511 keV galactic compact objects has been found [...] We present the first deep\nIBIS 511 keV all-sky map, obtained by applying standard analysis to about 5\nyears of data. Possible 511 keV signals are also searched over hour-day-month\ntimescales. The IBIS sensitivity at 511 keV depends on the detector quantum\nefficiency at this energy and on the background. Both these quantities were\nestimated in this work. We find no evidence of Galactic 511 keV point sources.\nWith an exposure of 10 Ms in the center of the Galaxy, we estimate a $1.6\n\\times 10^{-4}\\,ph\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}$ flux 2 sigma upper limit. A similar limit\nis given in a wide area in the Galactic center region with similar exposures.\nThe IBIS 511 keV flux upper limits for microquasars and supernova remnants\ndetected in the hard X domain ($E > 20\\, keV$) are also reported. Our results\nare consistent with a diffuse $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation scenario. If positrons\nare generated in compact objects, we expect that a significant fraction of them\npropagate in the interstellar medium before there are annihilated away from\ntheir birth places.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 15:53:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 15:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Through Fourier transforms of the evolution of\nmatter variables, we can identify a number of oscillation modes, as well as\nseveral nonlinear components (combination frequencies). We focus on the\ndominant m=2 mode, which forms a triplet with two nonlinear components that are\nthe result of coupling to the quasiradial mode. A corresponding triplet of\nfrequencies is identified in the gravitational wave spectrum, when the\nindividual masses of the compact objects are in the most likely range of 1.2 to\n1.35 $M_\\odot$. We can thus associate, through direct analysis of the dynamics\nof the fluid, a specific frequency peak in the gravitational wave spectrum with\nthe nonlinear component resulting from the difference between the m=2 mode and\nthe quasiradial mode. Once such observations become available, both the m=2 and\nquasiradial mode frequencies could be extracted, allowing for the application\nof gravitational-wave asteroseismology to the post-merger remnant and leading\nto tight constraints on the equation of state of high-density matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2011 15:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
