However channel noise cancels out the potential unboundedness of the\nfirst aspect, leaving typical channels with only a finite capacity per instant\nof time.

A potential source\nof unreliability that might restrict the capacity also from the second aspect\nis delay: Signals transmitted by the sender at a given point of time may not be\nreceived with a predictable delay at the receiving end.

The continuous process becomes the limit of our\nprocess as the time subdivision becomes infinitesimal. We taxonomize this class\nof communication channels based on whether the delays and noise are stochastic\nor adversarial; and based on how much information each aspect has about the\nother when introducing its errors. We analyze the limits of such channels and\nreach somewhat surprising conclusions: The capacity of a physical channel is\nfinitely bounded only if at least one of the two sources of error (signal noise\nor delay noise) is adversarial. In particular the capacity is finitely bounded\nonly if the delay is adversarial, or the noise is adversarial and acts with\nknowledge of the stochastic delay.

When constructed in a particular manner, Fourier extensions share\nmany of the same features of a standard Fourier series. In particular, one can\ncompute Fourier extensions which converge spectrally fast whenever the function\nis smooth, and exponentially fast if the function is analytic, much the same as\nthe Fourier series of a smooth/analytic and periodic function.\n  With this in mind, the purpose of this paper is to describe, analyze and\nexplain the observation that Fourier extensions, much like classical Fourier\nseries, also have excellent resolution properties for representing oscillatory\nfunctions. The resolution power, or required number of degrees of freedom per\nwavelength, depends on a user-controlled parameter and, as we show, it varies\nbetween 2 and \\pi. The former value is optimal and is achieved by classical\nFourier series for periodic functions, for example. The latter value is the\nresolution power of algebraic polynomial approximations.

This result is supported by more than one approach to study of\naveraging in cosmology.

Our results show that\ndeep Colour-Magnitude Diagrams (photometric error, $\\pm$0.25 at I$\\ge$27.2;\nH$\\ge$25. and K$_s\\ge$24.6) of old stellar populations in galaxies, at the\ndistance of Virgo, are feasible at a maximum surface brightness, $\\mu_V \\sim$\n17 mag/arcsec$^2$ (down to M$_I > -4$ and M$_H \\sim$ M$_K > -6$), and\nsignificantly deeper (photometric error, $\\pm$0.25 at I$\\ge$29.3; H$\\ge$26.6\nand K$_s\\ge$26.2) for $\\mu_V \\sim$ 21 mag/arcsec$^2$ (down to M$_I \\ge -2$ and\nM$_H \\sim$ M$_K \\ge -4.5$). The photometric errors, and thus also the depth of\nthe photometry should be improved with photometry packages specifically\ndesigned to adapt to an ELT MCAO Point Spread Function. We also make a simple\ncomparison between these simulations and what can be expected from a Single\nConjugate Adaptive Optics feed to MICADO and also the James Webb Space\nTelescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2011 19:12:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 08:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The interaction of two isotropic stellar winds is studied in order to\ncalculate the free-free emission from the wind collision region. The effects of\nthe binary separation and the wind momentum ratio on the emission from the\nwind-wind interaction region are investigated. Methods. We developed a\nsemi-analytical model for calculating the thermal emission from colliding\nstellar winds. Assuming radiative shocks for the compressed layer, which are\nexpected in close binaries, we obtained the emission measure of the thin shell.\nThen, we computed the total optical depth along each line of sight to obtain\nthe emission from the whole configuration. Results. Here, we present\npredictions of the free-free emission at radio frequencies from analytic,\nradiative shock models in colliding wind binaries. It is shown that the\nemission from the wind collision region mainly arises from the optically thick\nregion of the compressed layer and scales as ~ D^{4/5}, where D is the binary\nseparation. The predicted flux density from the wind collision region becomes\nmore important as the frequency increases, showing higher spectral indices than\nthe expected 0.6 value from the unshocked winds. We also investigate the\nemission from short-period WR+O systems calculated with our analytic\nformulation. In particular, we apply the model to the binary systems WR 98 and\nWR 113 and compare our results with the observations. Our theoretical results\nare in good agreement with the observed thermal spectra from these sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2011 19:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Recentely, Palmer and\nKuhns used the TreadmillSled to classify all helicoidal surfaces with constant\nanisotropic mean curvature coming from axially symmetric anisotropic energy\ndensity. Also the author proved that an helicoidal surface different from a\ncylinder has constant Gauss curvature if and only if the TreadmillSled of its\nprofile curve lies in a vertical semi line contained in the lower or upper half\nplane and not contained in the y-axis... Why not the whole vertical line? and\nwhy the semi-line cannot be contained in the y-axis?

The diffuse X-ray spectrum was described with a simple power-law\nmodel with a photon index of 1.92 (-0.17+0.13) (-0.06+0.04), where the first\nand second errors represent the statistical and systematic ones. The agreement\nwith the synchrotron radio photon index, 1.95 +- 0.01 in 326 -- 608.5 MHz,\nensures that the excess X-ray emission is attributed to the inverse Compton\nemission from the synchrotron-radiating electrons, boosting up the cosmic\nmicrowave background photons. From the X-ray flux density, 51.5 +-3.9\n(-5.4+6.2) nJy at 1 keV derived with the photon index fixed at the radio index,\nin comparison with the synchrotron radio intensity of 10.30 +- 0.12 Jy at 326\nMHz, the magnetic and electron energy densities was estimated as u_m = (3.0\n+-0.2 +-0.4) \\times 10^(-14) ergs/cm3 and u_e = (3.4 (-0.2+0.3) (-0.4+0.5))\n\\times 10^(-14) ergs/cm3 integrated over the electron Lorentz factor of 10^3 --\n10^5, respectively.

The\nX-ray mass distributions are similar in the central region but have varying\nouter slopes, while the GC mass profile is higher in the central region and on\nthe upper end of the range further out. Our models cannot differentiate between\nthe potentials in the central region, and therefore if non-thermal pressures or\nmulti-phase components are present in the hot gas, they must be smaller than\npreviously inferred. In the halo, we find that the PN velocities are sensitive\ntracers of the mass, preferring a less massive halo than that derived from the\nGC mass profile, but similar to one of the mass distributions derived from\nX-rays.

The linearized elastic framework yields exact\nsolutions for these rippled shapes. For compressive edge stresses, the body\nstrain emerges as a key variable that controls their relative stability and in\nextreme cases stabilizes co-existing transverse ripples. Tensile edge stresses\nlead to dimples within the ribbon core that decay into the edges, a feature of\nobvious significance for stretchable nanoelectronics. The interplay between\ngeometry and mechanics that we report should serve as a key input for\nquantifying the transport along these ribbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2011 22:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Images\ntaken in infrared H2 emission lines show that at least part of the molecular\nemission is produced inside the ionised region. In the best-studied case, the\nHelix nebula, the H2 emission is produced inside cometary knots (CKs),\ncomet-shaped structures believed to be clumps of dense neutral gas embedded\nwithin the ionised gas. Most of the H2 emission of the CKs seems to be produced\nin a thin layer between the ionised diffuse gas and the neutral material of the\nknot, in a mini photodissociation region (PDR).

We also proposed that the separation between the\nH_alpha and NII peak emission observed in the images of CKs may be an effect of\nthe distance of the knot from the star, since for knots farther from the\ncentral star the NII line is produced closer to the border of the CK than\nH_alpha.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 00:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Dynamic contrast enhanced imaging through\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) was performed and found to greatly increase\nthe anatomical resolution of organs as a function of time post-injection.\nImportantly, PCA was able to discriminate organs such as the pancreas which\ncould not be resolved from real-time raw images. Tissue phantom studies were\nperformed to compare imaging in the NIR II region to the traditional NIR I\nbiological transparency window (700- 900 nm). Examination of the feature sizes\nof a common NIR I dye (indocyanine green, ICG) showed a more rapid loss of\nfeature contrast and integrity with increasing feature depth as compared to\nSWNTs in the NIR II region. The effects of increased scattering in the NIR I\nversus NIR II region were confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation. In vivo\nfluorescence imaging in the NIR II region combined with PCA analysis may\nrepresent a powerful approach to high resolution optical imaging through deep\ntissues, useful for a wide range of applications from biomedical research to\ndisease diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 05:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-19"}

The B - site doped samples are isostructural and possess an\northorhombic structure in \\textit{Pnma} space group at 300K. A structural\ntransition from orthorhombic to monoclinic is found to precede the magnetic\ntransition to CE - type antiferromagnetic state in few of these samples.

This assertion supports strongly in theory that the unitary\nquantum dynamics is the fundamental and universal principle in nature. On the\nother hand, the symmetric structure of Hilbert space of a composite quantum\nsystem is the quantum-computing resource that is not owned by classical\ncomputation. A new quantum-computing speedup theory is set up on the basis of\nthe unitary quantum dynamics. Both the unitary quantum dynamics and the\nsymmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space of the quantum system are\nmainly responsible for an exponential quantum-computing speedup for a general\nefficient quantum algorithm. The inherent importance for the unitary quantum\ndynamics to speed up a quantum computation lies in the unique ability of the\nunitary quantum dynamics to build the effective interaction between the\nsymmetric structure of the Hilbert space of the quantum system and the\nmathematical symmetric structure of a problem to be solved on the quantum\nsystem. This unique ability could result in an essential difference of\ncomputational power between quantum and classical computations by combining the\nsymmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space. The new\nquantum-computing speedup theory also provides reasonable mechanisms for\nexponential quantum-computing speedup for the existing efficient quantum\nalgorithms based on the quantum parallel principle. These existing quantum\nalgorithms including the hidden-subgroup-problem quantum algorithms and\nconventional quantum search algorithms have the common character that the\nsymmetric structure of the Hilbert space does not have any effective effect on\nthese quantum algorithms.

Motivated by these discrepancies, we carefully\nexamine three theoretical approaches based on (1) the statistics of thresholded\nregions, (2) a peak-background split method based on separation of scales, and\n(3) a peak-background split method using the conditional mass function. We\nfirst demonstrate that the statistics of thresholded regions, which is shown to\nbe equivalent at leading order to a local bias expansion, cannot explain the\nmass-dependent deviation between theory and N-body simulations.

It is also rich in interstellar\nmatter, and contains evidence of the interplay between massive stars and their\nsurrounding medium, such as the rim HII region NGC 6188. Aims: We provide\nrobust estimates of the fundamental parameters (age and distance) of the two\nmost prominent stellar clusters, NGC 6167 and NGC 6193, that may be used as a\nbasis for studing the star formation history of the region. Methods: The study\nis based on a photometric optical survey (UBVIHa) of NGC 6167 and NGC 6193 and\ntheir nearby field, complemented with public data from 2MASS-VVV, UCAC3, and\nIRAC-Spitzer in this region. Results: We produce a uniform photometric\ncatalogue and estimate more robustly the fundamental parameters of NGC 6167 and\nNGC 6193, in addition to the IRAS 16375-4854 source. As a consequence, all of\nthem are located at approximately the same distance from the Sun in the\nSagittarius-Carina Galactic arm. However, the ages we estimate differ widely:\nNGC 6167 is found to be an intermediate-age cluster (20-30 Myr), NGC 6193 a\nvery young one (1-5 Myr) with PMS, H? emitters and class II objects, and the\nIRAS 16375-4854 source is the youngest of the three containing several YSOs.\nConclusions: These results support a picture in which Ara OB1a is a region\nwhere star formation has proceeded for several tens of Myr until the present.\nThe difference in the ages of the different stellar groups can be interpreted\nas a consequence of a triggered star formation process. In the specific case of\nNGC 6193, we find evidence of possible non-coeval star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 13:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

The volatility structure is\ndeterministic but time-varying and allows for changes that are commonly\nobserved in economic or financial multivariate series. Our analysis is based on\nthe residual autocovariances and autocorrelations obtained from Ordinary Least\nSquares (OLS), Generalized Least Squares (GLS)and Adaptive Least Squares (ALS)\nestimation of the autoregressive parameters. The ALS approach is the GLS\napproach adapted to the unknown time-varying volatility that is then estimated\nby kernel smoothing. The properties of the three types of residual\nautocovariances and autocorrelations are derived. In particular it is shown\nthat the ALS and GLS residual autocorrelations are asymptotically equivalent.\nIt is also found that the asymptotic distribution of the OLS residual\nautocorrelations can be quite different from the standard chi-square asymptotic\ndistribution obtained in a correctly specified VAR model with iid innovations.\nAs a consequence the standard portmanteau tests are unreliable in our\nframework.

During each merger, supermassive black hole binaries are\nsurrounded by a circumbinary accretion disk that imposes a significant (~1e4 G\nfor a binary of 1e8 Msun) magnetic field. The motion of the binary through that\nfield will convert the field energy to Poynting flux, with a luminosity ~1e43\nerg/s (B/1e4 G)^2 (M/1e8 Msun)^2, some of which may emerge as synchrotron\nemission at frequencies near 1 GHz where current and planned wide-field radio\nsurveys will operate. We find that the short timescales of many mergers will\nlimit their detectability with most planned blind surveys to <1 per year over\nthe whole sky, independent of the details of the emission process and flux\ndistribution. Including an optimistic estimate for the radio flux makes\ndetection even less likely, with <1 mergers per year over the whole sky.\nHowever, wide-field radio instruments may be able to localize systems\nidentified in advance of merger by gravitational waves.

Our results\nreveal that fake content represents an important portion (35%) of those files\nshared in BitTorrent and just a few tens of users are responsible for 90% of\nthis content. Furthermore, more than 99% of the analysed fake files are linked\nto either malware or scam websites. This creates a serious threat for the\nBitTorrent ecosystem. To address this issue, we present a new detection tool\nnamed TorrentGuard for the early detection of fake content. Based on our\nevaluation this tool may prevent the download of more than 35 millions of fake\nfiles per year. This could help to reduce the number of computer infections and\nscams suffered by BitTorrent users. TorrentGuard is already available and it\ncan be accessed through both a webpage or a Vuze plugin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 15:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 11:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 21:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-23"}

We find that only two of the 4 bi-spinor\ncomponents survive to the boundary, one effect of which is to cause the\ngeodesics to experience a drag towards the Hubble frame. We then present\narguments for the existence of a genuine boundary condition on the wavefunction\nat the future conformal singularity based upon the assumption there is no\nredundant copy of the universe in the post-conformal singularity era. This\nfuture boundary condition affects the spectral decomposition of the\nwavefunction, and this maybe locally testable at the present time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 05:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}
