In agreement with previous\nstudies, for the low-mass planet cases ($q=5\\times10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$),\nmigration is dominated by random fluctuations in the torque. For a Jupiter-mass\nplanet $(q=M_{p}/M_{s}=10^{-3}$ for $M_{s}=1M_{\\odot})$, we find a reduction of\nthe magnetic stress inside the orbit of the planet and around the gap region.\nAfter an initial stage where the torque on the planet is positive, it reverses\nand we recover migration rates similar to those found in disks where the\nturbulent viscosity is modelled by an $\\alpha$ viscosity.

The\nmagnitude of the horseshoe drag can overcome the negative Lindblad contribution\nwhen the local surface density profile is flat or increasing outwards, which we\nsee in certain locations in our simulations due to the presence of a zonal\nflow.

The mobility as a\nfunction of bias possesses a large threshold value when entering a nonlinear\ntransport regime. This value depends on the temperature, electron density,\nimpurity scattering strength, nanoribbon width and correlation length for the\nline-edge roughness. An enhanced electron mobility beyond this threshold has\nbeen observed, which is related to the initially-heated electrons in high\nenergy states with a larger group velocity. However, this mobility enhancement\nquickly reaches a maximum governed by the Fermi velocity in graphene and the\ndramatically increased phonon scattering. Super-linear and sub-linear\ntemperature dependences of the mobility are seen in the linear and nonlinear\ntransport regimes, which is attributed separately to the results of sweeping\nelectrons from the right Fermi edge to the left one through elastic scattering\nand moving electrons from low-energy states to high-energy ones through\nfield-induced electron heating. The threshold field is pushed up by a decreased\ncorrelation length in the high field regime, and is further accompanied by a\nreduced magnitude in the mobility enhancement. This implies an anomalous\nhigh-field increase of the line-edge roughness scattering with decreasing\ncorrelation length due to the occupation of high-energy states by field-induced\nelectron heating. Additionally, a self-consistent device modeling has been\nproposed for graphene transistors under an optical modulation on its gate,\nwhich employs Boltzmann moment equations up to the third order for describing\nfast carrier dynamics and full wave electromagnetics coupled to the Boltzmann\nequation for describing spatial-temporal dependence of the total field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 16:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This basis is used to\nfind the analytic invariants linked to the monodromy of the chosen basis around\nthe singular points. The analytic invariants give a complete geometric\ninterpretation to the well-known Stokes matrices at $\\epsilon =0$: this\nincludes the link (existing at least for the generic cases) between the\ndivergence of the solutions at $\\epsilon =0$ and the presence of logarithmic\nterms in the solutions for resonance values of the unfolding parameter.\nFinally, we give a realization theorem for a given complete system of analytic\ninvariants satisfying a necessary and sufficient condition, thus identifying\nthe set of modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 18:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

To understand the interactive effects of environmental\nstochasticity, spatial heterogeneity, and dispersal on population growth, we\nstudy the following model for population abundances in $n$ patches: the\nconditional law of $X_{t+dt}$ given $X_t=x$ is such that when $dt$ is small the\nconditional mean of $X_{t+dt}^i-X_t^i$ is approximately $[x^i\\mu_i+\\sum_j(x^j\nD_{ji}-x^i D_{ij})]dt$, where $X_t^i$ and $\\mu_i$ are the abundance and per\ncapita growth rate in the $i$-th patch respectivly, and $D_{ij}$ is the\ndispersal rate from the $i$-th to the $j$-th patch, and the conditional\ncovariance of $X_{t+dt}^i-X_t^i$ and $X_{t+dt}^j-X_t^j$ is approximately $x^i\nx^j \\sigma_{ij}dt$. We show for such a spatially extended population that if\n$S_t=(X_t^1+...+X_t^n)$ is the total population abundance, then $Y_t=X_t/S_t$,\nthe vector of patch proportions, converges in law to a random vector $Y_\\infty$\nas $t\\to\\infty$, and the stochastic growth rate $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}t^{-1}\\log\nS_t$ equals the space-time average per-capita growth rate\n$\\sum_i\\mu_i\\E[Y_\\infty^i]$ experienced by the population minus half of the\nspace-time average temporal variation $\\E[\\sum_{i,j}\\sigma_{ij}Y_\\infty^i\nY_\\infty^j]$ experienced by the population.

Radial velocity monitoring of very cool dwarfs such as late M- and\nhot L-dwarfs has become a promising tool to search for rocky planets as well as\nto follow-up planetary candidates around dwarfs found by transit surveys. These\nstars are faint at optical wavelengths, as their spectral flux distribution\npeaks at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. For this reason, it is desirable to\nmeasure the radial velocities in this wavelength regime. However, in the NIR\nthere are only very few medium- and high-resolution spectrographs available\nwhich are mounted at large telescopes. In the near future, high-resolution\nspectrographs for the NIR will be built, which will allow us to search for\nrocky planets around cool M-dwarfs and L-dwarfs from radial velocities\nmonitoring.\n  Methods. Stellar atmosphere synthetic models for an M- and an L-dwarf with\ntemperatures of 2200 K and 1800 K, respectively, and a theoretical spectrum of\nthe Earth's transmission in the spectral range from 0.9 to 2.5 \\mum are used.\nWe simulate a series of Doppler-shifted spectra observed with different\nresolving powers and signal-to-noise ratios, and for different rotational\nbroadenings of the dwarf. For different combinations of the input parameters we\nrecover the radial velocity by means of cross-correlation with a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio template and determine the associate uncertainties.\n  Results. The highest precision in radial velocity measurements for the cool\nM-dwarf is found in the Y band around 1.0 \\mum, while for the L-dwarf it is\ndetermined in the J band around 1.25 \\mum. We note that synthetic models may\nlack of some faint absorption features or underestimate their abundances.\nConversely, some instrumental/calibration aspects that are not taken into\naccount in our estimations would rise the uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 19:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Electric\ndipole emission from spinning dust grains continues to be the favored\ninterpretation of anomalous microwave emission. In this paper, we present a\nmethod to calculate the rotational emission from small grains of irregular\nshape with moments of inertia $I_{1}> I_{2}> I_{3}$. We show that a torque-free\nrotating irregular grain with a given angular momentum radiates at multiple\nfrequency modes. The resulting spinning dust spectrum has peak frequency and\nemissivity increasing with the degree of grain shape irregularity, which is\ndefined by $I_{1}:I_{2}:I_{3}$. We discuss how the orientation of dipole moment\n$\\bmu$ in body coordinates affects the spinning dust spectrum for different\nregimes of internal thermal fluctuations. We show that the spinning dust\nemissivity for the case of strong thermal fluctuations is less sensitive to the\norientation of $\\bmu$ than in the case of weak thermal fluctuations. We\ncalculate spinning dust spectra for a range of gas density and dipole moment.\nThe effect of compressible turbulence on spinning dust emission intensity is\ninvestigated. We show that the emission intensity in a turbulent medium\nincreases by a factor from 1.2-1.4 relative to that in a uniform medium, as\nsonic Mach number $M_{s}$ increases from 2-7. Finally, spinning dust parameters\nare constrained by fitting our improved model to five-year {\\it Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe} cross-correlation foreground spectra, for both the\nH$\\alpha$-correlated and 100 $\\mu$m-correlated emission spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 20:03:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 03:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 13:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Utilizing over\n112,778 BOSS spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshift\ncatalog for the galaxies in the SDSS DR8 imaging area that, after masking,\ncovers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). We investigate\nfluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function of\nGalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,\nphotometric offset, and North/South Galactic hemisphere. We find that the\npresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are not\ntraditionally masked) effectively remove area. Failing to correct for such\nstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlation\nfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. We describe how\none can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing any\ngalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. Additionally, we\napply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errors\nimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. We find\nthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces a\nsystematic error on w. We measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05\nbetween 0.45 < z_phot < 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correcting\nfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generally\nconsistent with a generic LambdaCDM model, at scales up to 60 degrees. At\nscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot > 0.5, the magnitude of the\ncorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 21:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 08:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Its toroidal\nnebula indicates equatorial mass loss during RLOF, while the mass-gaining star\nis apparently embedded in an opaque accretion disk. RY Scuti's toroidal nebula\nhas two components: an inner ionised double-ring system, and an outer dust\ntorus that is twice the size of the ionised rings. We present two epochs of\nLband Keck NGS-AO images of the dust torus, plus three epochs of HST images of\nthe ionised gas rings. Proper motions show that the inner ionised rings and the\nouter dust torus came from two separate ejection events roughly 130 and 250 yr\nago. This suggests that RLOF in massive contact binaries can be accompanied by\neruptive and episodic burst of mass loss, reminiscent of LBVs.

Such\napplications ultimately depend on the notion of similarity between items to\nproduce high-quality results. Current state-of-the-art systems employ\ncollaborative filter methods to represent musical items, effectively comparing\nitems in terms of their constituent users. While collaborative filter\ntechniques perform well when historical data is available for each item, their\nreliance on historical data impedes performance on novel or unpopular items. To\ncombat this problem, practitioners rely on content-based similarity, which\nnaturally extends to novel items, but is typically out-performed by\ncollaborative filter methods.\n  In this article, we propose a method for optimizing contentbased similarity\nby learning from a sample of collaborative filter data. The optimized\ncontent-based similarity metric can then be applied to answer queries on novel\nand unpopular items, while still maintaining high recommendation accuracy. The\nproposed system yields accurate and efficient representations of audio content,\nand experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy over\ncompeting content-based recommendation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 00:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-13"}

Molecular scales of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$\nwave dynamics are coupled with $\\mathbf{A}$ fields developed at macroscopic\nregional scales measured by coherent neuronal firing activity measured by scalp\nEEG.

The SMNI model supports a mechanism wherein the $\\mathbf{p} + q\n\\mathbf{A}$ interaction at tripartite synapses, via a dynamic centering\nmechanism (DCM) to control background synaptic activity, acts to maintain\nshort-term memory (STM) during states of selective attention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 01:32:56 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 05:03:02 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 19:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2013 21:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 18:46:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2012 12:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2013 21:49:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 15:39:11 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 5 May 2013 15:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 21:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2013 12:55:01 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2013 01:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

A graph's sandpile group is part of a larger algebraic structure on\nthe graph, known as its sandpile monoid. Most of the work on sandpiles so far\nhas focused on the sandpile group rather than the sandpile monoid of a graph,\nand has also assumed the underlying graph to be undirected. A notable exception\nis the recent work of Babai and Toumpakari, which builds up the theory of\nsandpile monoids on directed graphs from scratch and provides many connections\nbetween the combinatorics of a graph and the algebraic aspects of its sandpile\nmonoid.\n  In this paper we primarily consider sandpile monoids on directed graphs, and\nwe extend the existing theory in four main ways. First, we give a combinatorial\nclassification of the maximal subgroups of a sandpile monoid on a directed\ngraph in terms of the sandpile groups of certain easily-identifiable subgraphs.\nSecond, we point out certain sandpile results for undirected graphs that are\nreally results for sandpile monoids on directed graphs that contain exactly two\nidempotents. Third, we give a new algebraic constraint that sandpile monoids\nmust satisfy and exhibit two infinite families of monoids that cannot be\nrealized as sandpile monoids on any graph. Finally, we give an explicit\ncombinatorial description of the sandpile group identity for every graph in a\nfamily of directed graphs which generalizes the family of (undirected)\ndistance-regular graphs. This family includes many other graphs of interest,\nincluding iterated wheels, regular trees, and regular tournaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 02:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 19:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-20"}

A channel-dependent\nfixed-power training scheme is proposed for acquiring CSIT, along with a\nforward-link data transmit power control scheme. With perfect CSIR, the\nproposed scheme is shown to achieve a diversity order that is quadratically\nincreasing with the number of receive antennas.

This\nquestion is particularly relevant to assess the planet-making potential of\nthese lower mass discs. Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young\nstars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of\ndisc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference\nbetween the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest\nneighbour distance (normalised to the number of sources), where the older\npopulation should appear more spread out.\n  To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low\nmass star forming regions. We find no evidence for significant age differences\nbetween the disc-bearing low-mass (later than M2) and 'solar-type' (earlier\nthan M2) stars in these regions. We model our results by constructing and\nanalysing synthetic fractal distributions that we evolve for typical values of\nthe velocity dispersions. A comparison of simple models to our MST analysis\nsuggests that the lifetime of discs around M-stars is similar to that of discs\naround solar-type stars. Furthermore, a model-independent spatial analysis of\nthe observations robustly shows that any age differences between the two\nsamples must be smaller than the average age difference between disc-bearing\nclassical T-Tauri stars and disc-less Weak-Lined T-Tauri stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 09:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In Section III,\nI first present an overview of the diversity of cellular motility mechanisms,\nwhich might at first glance be categorized into two different types of\nbehaviors, namely \"swimming\" and \"crawling\". Intracellular transport, mitosis -\nor cell division - as well as other extensions of cell motility that rely on\nthe same essential machinery are briefly sketched. In Section IV, I introduce\nthe molecular machinery that underlies cell motility - the cytoskeleton - as\nwell as its interactions with the external environment of the cell and its main\nregulatory pathways. Sections IV D to IV F are more detailed in their\nbiochemical presentations; readers primarily interested in the theoretical\nmodeling of cell motility might want to skip these sections in a first reading.\nI then describe the motility mechanisms that rely essentially on\npolymerization-depolymerization dynamics of cytoskeleton filaments in Section\nV, and the ones that rely essentially on the activity of motor proteins in\nSection VI.

It is the smallest fraction of the social welfare that needs\nto be offered to each player to achieve that a social optimum is realized in a\npure Nash equilibrium. The selfishness level is unrelated to the price of\nstability and the price of anarchy and is invariant under positive linear\ntransformations of the payoff functions. Also, it naturally applies to other\nsolution concepts and other forms of games.\n  We study the selfishness level of several well-known strategic games. This\nallows us to quantify the implicit tension within a game between players'\nindividual interests and the impact of their decisions on the society as a\nwhole. Our analyses reveal that the selfishness level often provides a deeper\nunderstanding of the characteristics of the underlying game that influence the\nplayers' willingness to cooperate.\n  In particular, the selfishness level of finite ordinal potential games is\nfinite, while that of weakly acyclic games can be infinite. We derive explicit\nbounds on the selfishness level of fair cost sharing games and linear\ncongestion games, which depend on specific parameters of the underlying game\nbut are independent of the number of players. Further, we show that the\nselfishness level of the $n$-players Prisoner's Dilemma is $c/(b(n-1)-c)$,\nwhere $b$ and $c$ are the benefit and cost for cooperation, respectively, that\nof the $n$-players public goods game is $(1-\\frac{c}{n})/(c-1)$, where $c$ is\nthe public good multiplier, and that of the Traveler's Dilemma game is\n$\\frac{1}{2}(b-1)$, where $b$ is the bonus.

In recent years nuclear astrophysicists have developed more\nand more sophisticated r-process models, by adding new astrophysical or nuclear\nphysics ingredients to explain the solar system composition in a satisfactory\nway. Despite these efforts, the astrophysical site of the r-process remains\nunidentified. The composition of the neutron star outer crust material is\ninvestigated after the decompression that follows its possible ejection. The\ncomposition of the outer crust of a neutron star is estimated before and after\ndecompression. Two different possible initial conditions are considered, namely\nan idealized crust composed of cold catalyzed matter and a crust initially in\nnuclear statistical equilibrium at temperatures around 10 GK. We show that in\nthis second case before decompression and at temperatures typically\ncorresponding to 8 GK, the Coulomb effect due to the high densities in the\ncrust leads to an overall composition of the outer crust in neutron-rich nuclei\nwith a mass distribution close to the solar system r-abundance distribution.\nSuch distributions differ, however, from the solar one due to a systematic\nshift in the second peak to lower values. After decompression, the capture of\nthe few neutrons per seed nucleus available in the hot outer crust leads to a\nfinal distribution of stable neutron-rich nuclei with a mass distribution of 80\n< A < 140 nuclei in excellent agreement with the solar distribution, provided\nthe outer crust is initially at temperatures around 8 GK and all layers of the\nouter crust are ejected. The decompression of the neutron star matter from the\nouter crust provides suitable conditions for a robust r-processing of the light\nspecies, i.e., r-nuclei with A < 140.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 12:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

With the aim of detecting this gas, we carried out a deep Halpha\nkinematical analysis of two Sculptor group galaxies, NGC 247 and NGC 300.

I finish by\npresenting similar results derived from more realistic Monte Carlo Realisation\nsimulations (where arrival time and spatial locations are partially\ncorrelated). These also show that total hegemony is typically broken, even when\nthe total population of civilisations remains low. In the terminology of\nprevious studies of solutions to Fermi's Paradox, this confirms the Zoo\nHypothesis as a \"soft\" solution. However, an important question to be resolved\nby future work is the extent to which many separate hegemonies are established,\nand to what extent this affects the Zoo Hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 14:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Some new classes integrable and nonintegrable FRW\ncosmological models were constructed. It is remarkable that all proposed\nintegrable and nonintegrable FRW models admit exact solutions. For some of\nthem, such exact solutions are presented. Some artificial two-dimensional FRW\nmodels were also proposed. Finally in Appendix, we extend the obtained results\nfor g-essence models and for its two reductions: k-essence and f-essence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 15:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-16"}

We determine the\nlocation of small-scale vortex motions in the solar photospheric region by\ncomputing the horizontal proper motions of small-scale structures on time\nseries of images. These plasma convectively-driven swirl motions are associated\nto: (1) downdrafts (that have been commonly explained as corresponding to sites\nwhere the plasma is cooled down and hence returned to the interior below the\nvisible photospheric level), and (2) horizontal velocity vectors converging\ninto a central point. The sink cores are proved to be the final destination of\npassive floats tracing plasma flows towards the center of each vortex.
