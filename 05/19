Such\ntechniques have proven quite fragile in time-varying channels because the CSIT\nis inherently imperfect due to estimation and feedback delay, as well\nquantization noise. An alternative approach recently proposed by Maddah-Ali and\nTse (MAT) allows for significant multiplexing gain in the multi-input\nsingle-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) even with transmit CSIT that is\ncompletely stale, i.e. uncorrelated with the current channel state. With $K$\nusers, their scheme claims to lose only a $\\log(K)$ factor relative to the full\n$K$ degrees of freedom (DoF) attainable in the MISO BC with perfect CSIT for\nlarge $K$. However, their result does not consider the cost of the feedback,\nwhich is potentially very large in high mobility (short channel coherence\ntime). In this paper, we more closely examine the MAT scheme and compare its\nDoF gain to single user transmission (which always achieves 1 DoF) and partial\nCSIT linear precoding (which achieves up to $K$). In particular, assuming the\nchannel coherence time is $N$ symbol periods and the feedback delay is $N_{\\rm\nfd}$ we show that when $N < (1+o(1)) K \\log K$ (short coherence time), single\nuser transmission performs best, whereas for $N> (1+o(1)) (N_{\\rm fd}+ K / \\log\nK)(1-\\log^{-1}K)^{-1}$ (long coherence time), zero-forcing precoding\noutperforms the other two. The MAT scheme is optimal for intermediate coherence\ntimes, which for practical parameter choices is indeed quite a large and\nsignificant range, even accounting for the feedback cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 16:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-19"}

For stars with\n[Fe/H] < -1.2, the thick disk shows very small gradients, <0.03 +/- 0.02\ndex/kpc, in alpha-enhancement, while we find a +0.01 +/- 0.04 dex/kpc radial\ngradient and a -0.09 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc vertical gradient in iron abundance. In\naddition, we show that the peak of the distribution of orbital eccentricities\nfor our sample agrees better with models in which the stars that comprise the\nthick disk were formed primarily in the Galaxy, with direct accretion of stars\ncontributing little. Our results thus disfavor direct accretion of stars from\ndwarf galaxies into the thick disk as a major contributor to the thick disk\npopulation, but cannot discriminate between alternative models for the thick\ndisk, such as those that invoke high-redshift (gas-rich) mergers, heating of a\npre-existing thin stellar disk by a minor merger, or efficient radial migration\nof stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 17:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The novel finding is a clear drop in the average scattering\nof the SNe Ia Hubble Magnitude M with the ECM Hubble depth D, after using the\naverage trend <M> computed in paper IX.

These networks are composed by nodes that have\nthe capability of using short-range communication technology like blue-tooth or\nWi-Fi, where nodes are carried by mobile users, and where links appear and\ndisappear according to the social relationships between the users. Our idea is\nto use social physical contacts, securely collected by wireless personal\nsmart-phones, as a biometric way to authenticate the legitimate owner of the\ndevice and detect the clone attack.

A fundamental property of networks is that the perturbation of\none node can affect other nodes, in a process that may cause the entire or\nsubstantial part of the system to change behavior and possibly collapse. Recent\nresearch in metabolic and food-web networks has demonstrated the concept that\nnetwork damage caused by external perturbations can often be mitigated or\nreversed by the application of compensatory perturbations. Compensatory\nperturbations are constrained to be physically admissible and amenable to\nimplementation on the network. However, the systematic identification of\ncompensatory perturbations that conform to these constraints remains an open\nproblem. Here, we present a method to construct compensatory perturbations that\ncan control the fate of general networks under such constraints. Our approach\naccounts for the full nonlinear behavior of real complex networks and can bring\nthe system to a desirable target state even when this state is not directly\naccessible. Applications to genetic networks show that compensatory\nperturbations are effective even when limited to a small fraction of all nodes\nin the network and that they are far more effective when limited to the\nhighest-degree nodes.

A 2-loop perturbative\ncalculation of the $\\beta$-function which describes the evolution of this\ntheory's running coupling constant predicts that it has a second zero at a\nfinite coupling. This non-trivial zero would be an infrared stable fixed point,\nin which case the theory with massless quarks would be a conformal field\ntheory. However, if the interaction between quarks and antiquarks becomes\nstrong enough that a chiral condensate forms before this IR fixed point is\nreached, the theory is QCD-like with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and\nconfinement. However, the presence of the nearby IR fixed point means that\nthere is a range of couplings for which the running coupling evolves very\nslowly, i.e. it 'walks'. We are simulating the lattice version of this theory\nwith staggered quarks at finite temperature studying the changes in couplings\nat the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoring transitions as the temporal\nextent ($N_t$) of the lattice, measured in lattice units, is increased. Our\nearlier results on lattices with $N_t=4,6$ show both transitions move to weaker\ncouplings as $N_t$ increases consistent with walking behaviour. In this paper\nwe extend these calculations to $N_t=8$. Although both transition again move to\nweaker couplings the change in the coupling at the chiral transition from\n$N_t=6$ to $N_t=8$ is appreciably smaller than that from $N_t=4$ to $N_t=6$.\nThis indicates that at $N_t=4,6$ we are seeing strong coupling effects and that\nwe will need results from $N_t > 8$ to determine if the chiral-transition\ncoupling approaches zero as $N_t \\rightarrow \\infty$, as needed for the theory\nto walk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 20:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 May 2011 20:12:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 03:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

It has been found that the Local Group,\nwhich is on the border of the LV, is running away from the void center at ~260\nkm/s. In this study we investigate the motion of the galaxies at the far-side\nborder of the LV to examine the presence of a possible expansion.

The\nnear-infrared Tully-Fisher relation was calibrated with a large sample of\ngalaxies and carefully corrected for Malmquist bias.

Among the 36\nsample LV galaxies with good quality HI line width measurements, only 15\ngalaxies were selected for measuring their distances and peculiar velocities,\nin order to avoid the effect of Malmquist bias. The average peculiar velocity\nof these 15 galaxies is found to be -419+208-251 km/s, which is not\nsignificantly different from zero. Due to the intrinsically large scatter of\nTully-Fisher relation, we cannot conclude whether there is a systematic motion\nagainst the center of the LV for the galaxies at the far-side boundary of the\nvoid.

After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We\nfurthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire\nsample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing\nthe AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries.

The\nsuperconducting qubit allows us to have an excellent controllability of the\nquantum states and the memory qubit is capable of storing the information for a\nlong time.

As alternatives to\nall-active FSO relaying, where all the available relays transmit concurrently,\nwe propose schemes that select only a single relay to participate in the\ncommunication between the source and the destination in each transmission slot.\nThis selection is based on the channel state information (CSI) obtained either\nfrom all or from some of the FSO links. Thus, the need for synchronizing the\nrelays' transmissions is avoided and the slowly varying nature of the\natmospheric channel is exploited. For both relay selection and all-active\nrelaying, novel closed-form expressions for their outage performance are\nderived, assuming the versatile Gamma-Gamma channel model. Furthermore, based\non the derived analytical results, the problem of allocating the optical power\nresources to the FSO links is addressed, and optimum and suboptimum solutions\nare proposed. Numerical results are provided for equal and non-equal length FSO\nlinks, which illustrate the outage behavior of the considered relaying\nprotocols and demonstrate the significant performance gains offered by the\nproposed power allocation schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 10:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-20"}

So, a suitable rank-two laminate the conductivity of which has a\nbounded antisymmetric part together with a high-contrast symmetric part, may\ngenerate an arbitrarily large antisymmetric part of the effective conductivity.\nOn the other hand, bounds are provided which show that the antisymmetric part\nof the effective conductivity must go to zero if the upper bound on the\nantisymmetric part of the local conductivity goes to zero, and the symmetric\npart of the local conductivity remains bounded below and above.

In NGC891 bulge and disk can explain the rotation curve without\nany need for dark matter out to ~15 kpc. In NGC7814 the bulge dominates in the\ninner parts; further out the rotation curve is well reproduced by a maximum\ndisk but its M/L ratio is excessively high.

Laboratory experiments have shown that dust\naggregates of these sizes stick to one another only at unreasonably low\nvelocities. However, in the protoplanetary disk, millimeter-sized particles are\nknown to have been ubiquitous. One can find relics of them in the form of solid\nchondrules as the main constituent of chondrites. Most of these chondrules were\nfound to feature a fine-grained rim, which is hypothesized to have formed from\naccreting dust grains in the solar nebula. To study the influence of these\ndust-coated chondrules on the formation of chondrites and possibly\nplanetesimals, we conducted collision experiments between millimeter-sized,\ndust-coated chondrule analogs at velocities of a few cm/s. For 2 and 3 mm\ndiameter chondrule analogs covered by dusty rims of a volume filling factor of\n0.18 and 0.35-0.58, we found sticking velocities of a few cm/s. This velocity\nis higher than the sticking velocity of dust aggregates of the same size. We\ntherefore conclude that chondrules may be an important step towards a deeper\nunderstanding of the collisional growth of larger bodies. Moreover, we analyzed\nthe collision behavior in an ensemble of dust aggregates and non-coated\nchondrule analogs. While neither the dust aggregates nor the solid chondrule\nanalogs show sticking in collisions among their species, we found an enhanced\nsicking efficiency in collisions between the two constituents, which leads us\nto the conjecture that chondrules might act as \"catalyzers\" for the growth of\nlarger bodies in the young Solar System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 14:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 09:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Existing codes for evolving binary black holes rely on\nexplicit timestepping methods, for which the timestep size is limited by the\nsmallest spatial scale through the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. Binary\ninspiral typically involves spatial scales (the spatial resolution required by\na small or rapidly spinning hole) which are orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe relevant (orbital, precession, and radiation-reaction) timescales\ncharacterizing the inspiral. Therefore, in explicit evolutions of binary black\nholes, the timestep size is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the\nrelevant physical timescales. Implicit timestepping methods allow for larger\ntimesteps, and they often reduce the total computational cost (without\nsignificant loss of accuracy) for problems dominated by spatial rather than\ntemporal error, such as for binary-black-hole inspiral in corotating\ncoordinates. However, fully implicit methods can be difficult to implement for\nnonlinear evolution systems like the Einstein equations. Therefore, in this\npaper we explore implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods and use them for the first\ntime to evolve black-hole spacetimes. Specifically, as a first step toward IMEX\nevolution of a full binary-black-hole spacetime, we develop an IMEX algorithm\nfor the generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein equations and use this\nalgorithm to evolve stationary and perturbed single-black-hole spacetimes.\nNumerical experiments explore the stability and computational efficiency of our\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 15:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 17:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}

It was suggested that the effect may be\nput to practical use in a future spin transistor design. In the present article\nwe revisit the problem and present a detailed analysis of the underlying\nphysics. First, we explore how the build-up of charge density wave correlations\nin the quantum wire due to the periodic gate configuration that produces the\nRashba modulation influences the transition to the insulating state. The\ninterplay between the modulations of the charge density and that of the\nspin-orbit coupling turns out to be quite subtle: Depending on the relative\nphase between the two modulations, the joint action of the Rashba interaction\nand charge density wave correlations may either enhance or reduce the Rashba\ncurrent blockade effect. Secondly, we inquire about the role of the Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit coupling that is generically present in a quantum wire embedded in\nsemiconductor heterostructure. While the Dresselhaus coupling is found to work\nagainst the current blockade of the insulating state, the effect is small in\nmost materials. Using an effective field theory approach, we also carry out an\nanalysis of effects from electron- electron interactions, and show how the\nsingle-particle gap in the insulating state can be extracted from the more\neasily accessible collective charge and spin excitation thresholds. The\nsmallness of the single-particle gap together with the anti-phase relation\nbetween the Rashba and chemical potential modulations pose serious difficulties\nfor realizing a Rashba-controlled current switch in an InAs-based device.
