When the slab\nof the atomic layers is sufficiently thick, the lower split state has a minimum\naway from $\\bar{\\Gamma}$, which is known as the Rashba effect. As the number of\nlayers decreases, the minimum approaches $\\bar{\\Gamma}$, and it is located at\n$\\bar{\\Gamma}$ for $N \\leq 14$. This crossover is analyzed in detail using two\nmodels: a tight-binding model and a bilayer nearly-free-electron model. It is\ndemonstrated that the features of surface band dispersion are clearly\nunderstood as the result of the competition between the interference of the\nsurface states on both sides and the spin-orbit interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We identify two distinct corrections on quasilinear scales\n(~ 30-80 Mpc/h): the non-linear mapping between real and redshift space\npositions, and the non-linear suppression of power in the velocity divergence\nfield. We model the first non-perturbatively using the scale-dependent Gaussian\nstreaming model, which we show is accurate at the <0.5 (2) per cent level in\ntransforming real space clustering and velocity statistics into redshift space\non scales s>10 (s>25) Mpc/h for the monopole (quadrupole) halo correlation\nfunctions.

Subsequent work by Aharoni, Holzman and Krivelevich\nshowed a tight integrality gap of (k/2 - o(1)) for the LP relaxation. While\nthis problem was known to be NP-hard for k >= 3, the first non-trivial\nNP-hardness of approximation factor of k/4- \\eps was shown in a recent work by\nGuruswami and Saket. They also showed that assuming Khot's Unique Games\nConjecture yields a k/2 - \\eps inapproximability for this problem, implying the\noptimality of Lov\\'asz's result.\n  In this work, we show that this problem is NP-hard to approximate within k/2-\n1 + 1/2k -\\eps. This hardness factor is off from the optimal by an additive\nconstant of at most 1 for k >= 4. Our reduction relies on the Multi-Layered PCP\nof Dinur et al. and uses a gadget - based on biased Long Codes - adapted from\nthe LP integrality gap of Aharoni et al. The nature of our reduction requires\nthe analysis of several Long Codes with different biases, for which we prove\nstructural properties of the so called cross-intersecting collections of set\nfamilies - variants of which have been studied in extremal set theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 20:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-24"}

Along with\nthe spatial filter, the edge-preserving bilateral filter [Tomasi1998] involves\nan additional range kernel. This is used to restrict the averaging to those\nneighborhood pixels whose intensity are similar or close to that of the pixel\nof interest. The range kernel operates by acting on the pixel intensities. This\nmakes the averaging process non-linear and computationally intensive,\nespecially when the spatial filter is large.

Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) can be detected out to very high redshifts\nduring the epoch of reionization. The evolution of the LAE luminosity function\nwith redshift is a direct probe of the Ly-alpha transmission of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), and therefore of the IGM neutral-hydrogen fraction.\nMeasuring the Ly-alpha luminosity function (LF) of LAEs at redshift z = 7.7\ntherefore allows us to constrain the ionizing state of the Universe at this\nredshift.\n  Methods. We observed three 7.5'x7.5' fields with the HAWK-I instrument at the\nVLT with a narrow band filter centred at 1.06 $\\mu$m and targeting LAEs at\nredshift z ~ 7.7. The fields were chosen for the availability of\nmultiwavelength data. One field is a galaxy cluster, the Bullet Cluster, which\nallowed us to use gravitational amplification to probe luminosities that are\nfainter than in the field. The two other fields are subareas of the GOODS\nChandra Deep Field South and CFHTLS-D4 deep field. We selected z=7.7 LAE\ncandidates from a variety of colour criteria, in particular from the absence of\ndetection in the optical bands.\n  Results. We do not find any LAE candidates at z = 7.7 in ~2.4 x 10^4 Mpc^3\ndown to a narrow band AB magnitude of ~ 26, which allows us to infer robust\nconstraints on the Ly-alpha LAE luminosity function at this redshift.\n  Conclusions.

This extrapolation would indicate that this rather clean sample of\nKFe2As2 exhibits non-Fermi liquid behavior, i. e. C/T increases at low\ntemperatures, in agreement with the reported non-Fermi liquid behavior in the\nresistivity. However, specific heat as a function of magnetic field shows that\nthe shoulder feature around 0.7 K, which is commonly seen in KFe2As2 samples,\nis not evidence for a second superconducting gap as has been previously\nproposed but instead is due to an unknown magnetic impurity phase, which can\naffect the entropy balance and the extrapolation of the normal state specific\nheat. This peak (somewhat larger in magnitude) with similar field dependence is\nalso found in a less pure sample of KFe2As2, with a residual resistivity ratio\nof only 90 and an onset Tc=3.1 K. These data, combined with the measured normal\nstate specific heat in field to suppress superconductivity, allow the\nconclusion that an increase in the normal state specific heat as T->0 is in\nfact not seen in KFe2As2, i. e. Fermi liquid behavior is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2011 14:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-24"}

We characterized friction networks with several networks\ncharacteristics. The correlation among network properties with the fracture\npermeability is the result of friction networks. The revealed hubs in the\ncomplex aperture networks confirmed the importance of highly correlated groups\nto conduct the highlighted features of the dynamical aperture field. We found\nthat there is a universal power law between the nodes' degree and motifs\nfrequency (for triangles it reads T(k)\\proptok{\\beta} ({\\beta}\n\\approx2\\pm0.3)). The investigation of localization effects on eigenvectors\nshows a remarkable difference in parallel and perpendicular aperture patches.\nFurthermore, we estimate the rate of stored energy in asperities so that we\nfound that the rate of radiated energy is higher in parallel friction networks\nthan it is in transverse directions. The final part of our research highlights\n4 point sub-graph distribution and its correlation with fluid flow. For shear\nrupture, we observed a similar trend in sub-graph distribution, resulting from\nparallel and transversal aperture profiles (a superfamily phenomenon).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2011 14:53:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 04:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}
