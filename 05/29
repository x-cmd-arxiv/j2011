In this context, random linear network\ncodes (dense codes) are asymptotically capacity-achieving, but require highly\ncomplex coding operations. To reduce the coding complexity, Maymounkov et al.\nproposed chunked codes (CC). Chunked codes operate by splitting the message\ninto non-overlapping chunks and send a randomly chosen chunk at each\ntransmission time by a dense code. The complexity, that is linear in the chunk\nsize, is thus reduced compared to dense codes. In this paper, the existing\nanalysis of CC is revised, and tighter bounds on the performance of CC are\nderived. As a result, we prove that (i) CC with sufficiently large chunks are\nasymptotically capacity-achieving, but with a slower speed of convergence\ncompared to dense codes; and (ii) CC with relatively smaller chunks approach\nthe capacity with an arbitrarily small but non-zero constant gap. To improve\nthe speed of convergence of CC, while maintaining their advantage in reducing\nthe computational complexity, we propose and analyze a new CC scheme with\noverlapping chunks, referred to as overlapped chunked codes (OCC). We prove\nthat for smaller chunks, which are advantageous due to lower computational\ncomplexity, OCC with larger overlaps provide a better tradeoff between the\nspeed of convergence and the message or packet error rate. This implies that\nfor smaller chunks, and with the same computational complexity, OCC outperform\nCC in terms of the speed of approaching the capacity for sufficiently small\ntarget error rate. In fact, we design linear-time OCC with very small chunks\n(constant in the message size) that are both computationally and\ncommunicationally efficient, and that outperform linear-time CC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2011 19:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

If the magnetic\nflux threading the cores is dragged into the stars, the stellar field would be\norders of magnitude stronger than observed. This well-known \"magnetic flux\nproblem\" demands that most of the core magnetic flux be decoupled from the\nmatter that enters the star. We carry out the first exploration of what happens\nto the decoupled magnetic flux in 3D, using an MHD version of the ENZO adaptive\nmesh refinement code. The field-matter decoupling is achieved through a sink\nparticle treatment, which is needed to follow the protostellar accretion phase\nof star formation. We find that the accumulation of the decoupled flux near the\naccreting protostar leads to a magnetic pressure buildup. The high pressure is\nreleased anisotropically, along the path of least resistance. It drives a\nlow-density expanding region in which the decoupled magnetic flux is expelled.\nThis decoupling-enabled magnetic structure has never been seen before in 3D MHD\nsimulations of star formation. It generates a strong asymmetry in the\nprotostellar accretion flow, potentially giving a kick to the star. In the\npresence of an initial core rotation, the structure presents an obstacle to the\nformation of a rotationally supported disk, in addition to magnetic braking, by\nacting as a rigid magnetic wall that prevents the rotating gas from completing\na full orbit around the central object. We conclude that the decoupled magnetic\nflux from the stellar matter can strongly affect the protostellar collapse\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2011 21:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Such a bifurcation is\nmore probable in a region of zero magnetic shear than one of finite magnetic\nshear because in the former case the component of the sheared toroidal flow\nthat is perpendicular to the magnetic field has the strongest suppressing\neffect on the turbulence. In the zero-magnetic-shear regime, there are no\ngrowing linear eigenmodes at any finite value of flow shear. However,\nsubcritical turbulence can be sustained, owing to the transient growth of modes\ndriven by the ion temperature gradient (ITG) and the parallel velocity gradient\n(PVG). Nonetheless, in a parameter space containing a wide range of temperature\ngradients and velocity shears, there is a sizeable window where all turbulence\nis suppressed. Combined with the relatively low transport of momentum by\ncollisional (neoclassical) mechanisms, this produces the conditions for a\nbifurcation from low to high temperature and velocity gradients. The path of\nthis bifurcation is mapped out using interpolation from a large number of\nsimulations. Numerical simulations are also used to construct a parametric\nmodel which accurately describes the combined effect of the temperature\ngradient and the flow gradient over a wide range of their values. Using this\nparametric model, it is shown that in this reduced-transport state, heat is\ntransported almost neoclassically, while momentum transport is dominated by\nsubcritical PVG turbulence. It is further shown that for any given input of\ntorque, there is an optimum input of heat which maximises the temperature\ngradient. The parametric model describes both the behaviour of the subcritical\nturbulence and the complicated effect of the flow shear on the transport\nstiffness.

Expression QTL is used to study the\nregulatory structure of normal tissues and to search for genetic factors in\ncomplex diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. A modern eQTL\ndataset contains millions of SNPs and thousands of transcripts measured for\nhundreds of samples. This makes the analysis computationally complex as it\ninvolves independent testing for association for every transcript-SNP pair. The\nheavy computational burden makes eQTL analysis less popular, often forces\nanalysts to restrict their attention to just a subset of transcripts and SNPs.\nAs larger genotype and gene expression datasets become available, the demand\nfor fast tools for eQTL analysis increases. We present a new method for fast\neQTL analysis via linear models, called Matrix eQTL. Matrix eQTL can model and\ntest for association using both linear regression and ANOVA models. The models\ncan include covariates to account for such factors as population structure,\ngender, and clinical variables. It also supports testing of heteroscedastic\nmodels and models with correlated errors. In our experiment on large datasets\nMatrix eQTL was thousands of times faster than the existing popular software\nfor QTL/eQTL analysis.

At\nvery high densities, the nucleation is not observed at all in the time window\naccessed by long molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Concomitantly, the system\nexhibits typical slow dynamics of the supercooled fluids near the glass\ntransition point. We compare the simulation results of the supercooled GCM with\nthe predictions of mode-coupling theory (MCT) and find that the agreement\nbetween them is better than any other model glassformers studied numerically in\nthe past.

A unidirectional component was observed in the angular dependent AMR. The\nfourfold symmetric AMR also existed for the magnetic field rotating in the\nplane perpendicular to the current. Our results indicate the AMR and PHE in\nsingle crystalline films have different origins, and also prove that the origin\nof the four-fold symmetry of AMR is related to the lattice symmetry rather than\nthe spin scattering near the antiphase boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2011 12:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-31"}

In multiple antenna wireless systems, limited feedback\nusually entails quantizing a source that lives on the Grassmann manifold. Most\nwork on limited feedback beamforming considered single-shot quantization. In\nwireless systems, however, the channel is temporally correlated, which can be\nused to reduce feedback requirements. Unfortunately, conventional predictive\nquantization does not incorporate the non-Euclidean structure of the Grassmann\nmanifold. In this paper, we propose a Grassmannian predictive coding algorithm\nwhere the differential geometric structure of the Grassmann manifold is used to\nformulate a predictive vector quantization encoder and decoder. We analyze the\nquantization error and derive bounds on the distortion attained by the proposed\nalgorithm. We apply the algorithm to a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output\nwireless system and show that it improves the achievable sum rate as the\ntemporal correlation of the channel increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2011 12:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-31"}

Subtle\nfeatures of the conductance anisotropy are revealed by measuring the transverse\nresistance Rxy in zero magnetic field. It is demonstrated that the sign of Rxy\ndepends on the orientation of the LSCO Hall bar with respect to the terrace\nstructure of the substrate. Unit-cell-high substrate step edges must therefore\nbe a dominant nucleation source for antiphase boundaries during film growth. We\nshow that the measurement of Rxy is sensitive enough to detect the\ncubic-tetragonal phase transition of the SrTiO3(100) (STO) substrate at 105 K.\nThe MR of LSCO thin films shows for 0.10 < x < 0.25 a non-monotonic temperature\ndependence, resulting from the onset of a linear term in the MR above 90 K. We\nshow that the linear MR scales with the absolute Hall resistivity, with the\nconstant of proportionality independent of temperature. Such scaling suggests\nthat the linear MR originates from current distortions induced by structural or\nelectronic inhomogeneities. The possible role of stripes for both the MR and\nthe conductance anisotropy is discussed throughout the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2011 15:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-01"}
