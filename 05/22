The\nmodel is intended for simulation of transient enhanced diffusion including\nredistribution of ion-implanted boron during low temperature annealing. The\nfollowing mechanisms of boron diffusion were proposed, namely: the mechanism of\na long-range migration of nonequilibrium boron interstitials and the mechanism\ndue to the formation, migration, and dissolution of the \"impurity atom -\nsilicon self-interstitial\" pairs. Based on the model, simulation of the\nredistribution of boron implanted into silicon substrates for annealing\ntemperatures of 800 and 900 Celsius degrees was carried out. The calculated\nboron concentration profiles agree well with the experimental data. It was\nshown that for a temperature of 800 Celsius degrees the transport of impurity\natoms occurred due to the long-range migration of nonequilibrium boron\ninterstitials generated during cluster transformation or dissolution. On the\nother hand, it was found that at a temperature of 900 Celsius degrees the pair\ndiffusion mechanism played a main role in the significant transient enhanced\ndiffusion. A number of parameters describing the transport of nonequilibrium\nboron interstitials and transient enhanced diffusion of substitutionally\ndissolved boron atoms were determined. For example, it was found that at a\ntemperature of 900 Celsius degrees the time-average enhancement of boron\ndiffusion was approximately equal to 44 times.

To prove this\nassessment, we have performed a number of experiments with cellular automata of\ncomplex behavior, which can be considered as universes in the mathematical\nmultiverse. The analogy between what happens in some automata (in particular\nConway's <<Game of Life>>) and the real world is very strong. But if the\nresults of our experiments can be extrapolated to our universe, we should\nexpect to inhabit -- in the context of the multiverse -- a world in which at\nleast some of the laws and constants of nature should show a certain time\ndependence. Actually, the probability of our existence in a world such as ours\nwould be mathematically equal to zero.

Unfortunately, in the real world, sensing\nmatrices do not always come from random processes. It is therefore desirable to\nevaluate whether an arbitrary matrix, or frame, is suitable for sensing sparse\nsignals. To this end, the present paper investigates two parameters that\nmeasure the coherence of a frame: worst-case and average coherence. We first\nprovide several examples of frames that have small spectral norm, worst-case\ncoherence, and average coherence. Next, we present a new lower bound on\nworst-case coherence and compare it to the Welch bound. Later, we propose an\nalgorithm that decreases the average coherence of a frame without changing its\nspectral norm or worst-case coherence. Finally, we use worst-case and average\ncoherence, as opposed to the Restricted Isometry Property, to garner\nnear-optimal probabilistic guarantees on both sparse signal detection and\nreconstruction in the presence of noise. This contrasts with recent results\nthat only guarantee noiseless signal recovery from arbitrary frames, and which\nfurther assume independence across the nonzero entries of the signal---in a\nsense, requiring small average coherence replaces the need for such an\nassumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2011 19:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

Our\nresults show that the preheating process in bouncing cosmology is even more\nefficient than that in inflationary cosmology. In the limit of weak coupling,\nthe period of preheating is doubled. For the case of normal coupling, the\nback-reaction of light fields can lead to thermalization before the bouncing\npoint. The scenario of matter bounce curvaton could be tightly constrained due\nto a large coupling coefficient if the curvaton field is expected to preheat\nthe universe directly. However, this concern can be greatly relaxed through the\nprocess of geometric preheating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2011 20:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

It has already been shown,\nand we reaffirm it in this paper, that the $dcx$ ordering of point processes is\nsuitable to compare their clustering tendencies. Hence, it was tempting to\nconjecture that $r_c$ is increasing in $dcx$ order. Some numerical evidences\nsupport this conjecture for a special class of point processes, called\nperturbed lattices, which are \"toy models\" for determinantal and permanental\npoint processes. However, the conjecture is not true in full generality, since\none can construct a Cox point process with degenerate critical radius $r_c=0$,\nthat is $dcx$ larger than a given homogeneous Poisson point process.\nNevertheless, we are able to compare some nonstandard critical radii related,\nrespectively, to the finiteness of the expected number of void circuits around\nthe origin and asymptotic of the expected number of long occupied paths from\nthe origin in suitable discrete approximations of the continuum model. These\nnew critical radii sandwich the \"true\" one. Surprisingly, the inequalities for\nthem go in opposite directions, which gives uniform lower and upper bounds on\n$r_c$ for all processes $dcx$ smaller than some given process. In fact, the\nabove results hold under weaker assumptions on the ordering of void\nprobabilities or factorial moment measures only. Examples of point processes\ncomparable to Poisson processes in this weaker sense include determinantal and\npermanental processes. More generally, we show that point processes $dcx$\nsmaller than homogeneous Poisson processes exhibit phase transitions in certain\npercolation models based on the level-sets of additive shot-noise fields, as\ne.g. $k$-percolation and SINR-percolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2011 21:50:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 17:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

An oscillating m-rim hook tableau is defined as a sequence\n$(\\lambda^0,\\lambda^1,...,\\lambda^{2n})$ of Young diagrams starting with the\nempty shape and ending with the empty shape such that $\\lambda^{i}$ is obtained\nfrom $\\lambda^{i-1}$ by adding an m-rim hook or by deleting an m-rim hook. Our\nbijection relies on the generalized Schensted algorithm due to White. An\noscillating 2-rim hook tableau is also called an oscillating domino tableau.\nWhen we restrict our attention to two column oscillating domino tableaux of\nlength 2n, we are led to a bijection between such tableaux and noncrossing\n2-colored matchings on $\\{1, 2,..., 2n\\}$, which are counted by the product\n$C_nC_{n+1}$ of two consecutive Catalan numbers. A 2-colored matching is\nnoncrossing if there are no two arcs of the same color that are intersecting.\nWe show that oscillating domino tableaux with at most two columns are in\none-to-one correspondence with Dyck path packings. A Dyck path packing of\nlength 2n is a pair (D, E), where D is a Dyck path of length 2n, and E is a\ndispersed Dyck path of length 2n that is weakly covered by D. So we deduce that\nDyck path packings of length 2n are counted by $C_nC_{n+1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2011 04:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-24"}
