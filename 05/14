The Fermi spectra in the GeV range can be well described by a wide\nunderlying lognormal distribution with the photon-photon absorption breaks\nproduced by the He II and H I Lyman recombination continua (LyC). We find a\npower-law dependence of the peak energy on flux and discover anti-correlation\nbetween the column density of the He II LyC and flux. This implies that the\ngamma-ray emission zone lies close to the boundary of the high-ionization part\nof the broad-line region and moves away from the black hole when the flux\nincreases.

One of the key\nobjections to the use of T&T to stop transmission concerns the role of the\nacute phase in HIV transmission. The acute phase of infection lasts for one to\nthree months after HIV-seroconversion during which time the risk of\ntransmission may be ten to twenty times higher, per sexual encounter, than it\nis during the chronic phase which lasts for the next ten years. Regular testing\nfor HIV is more likely to miss people who are in the acute phase than in the\nchronic phase and it is essential to determine the extent to which this might\ncompromise the impact of T&T on HIV-transmission.\n  Here we show that 1) provided the initial epidemic doubling time is about 1.0\nto 1.5 years, as observed in South Africa, random testing with an average test\ninterval of one year will still bring the epidemic close to elimination even if\nthe acute phase lasts for 3 months during which time transmission is 26 times\nhigher than in the chronic phase; 2) testing people regularly at yearly\nintervals is significantly more effective then testing them randomly; 3)\ntesting people regularly at six monthly intervals and starting them on ART\nimmediately, will almost certainly guarantee elimination.\n  In general it seems unlikely that elevated transmission during the acute\nphase is likely to change predictions of the impact of treatment on\ntransmission significantly. Other factors, in particular age structure, the\nstructure of sexual networks and variation in set-point viral load are likely\nto be more important and should be given priority in further analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 16:19:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 17:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-06"}

There is an overall consensus that black holes exist and many\nastronomical objects are identified with black holes. White holes were\nunderstood as the exact time reversal of black holes, therefore they should\ncontinuously throw away material. It is accepted, however, that a persistent\nejection of mass leads to gravitational pressure, the formation of a black hole\nand thus to the \"death of while holes\". So far, no astronomical source has been\nsuccessfully tagged a white hole. The only known white hole is the Big Bang\nwhich was instantaneous rather than continuous or long-lasting. We thus suggest\nthat the emergence of a white hole, which we name a 'Small Bang', is\nspontaneous - all the matter is ejected at a single pulse. Unlike black holes,\nwhite holes cannot be continuously observed rather their effect can only be\ndetected around the event itself. Gamma ray bursts are the most energetic\nexplosions in the universe. Long gamma-ray bursts were connected with supernova\neruptions. There is a new group of gamma-ray bursts, which are relatively close\nto Earth, but surprisingly lack any supernova emission. We propose identifying\nthese bursts with white holes.

We examine the dynamics in detail for a specific subset of\nparameters with non-empty interior.\n  There is an interior fixed point of the Poincare' map defined by the system.\nThis fixed point corresponds to a periodic solution with period $T$ in which\nthe three cluster exchange positions after time $T/3$. We call this solution\n3=cyclic. In all the parameters studied, the fixed point is either:\n  * isolated and locally unstable, or,\n  * contained in a neutrally stable set of period 3 points.\n  In the later case the edges of the neutrally stable set are unstable. This\ncase exists if either the three clusters are isolated from each other, or, if\nthey interact in a non-essential way.

Thus 3-cyclic solutions are\npractically unstable in the sense the arbitrarily small perturbations may lead\nto loss of stability and eventual merger of clusters. Since the single cluster\nsolution (synchronization) is the only solution that is asymptotically stable,\nit would seem to be the most likely to be observed in application if the\nfeedback is similar to the form we propose and is positive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 18:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-16"}

We analyse\nthe relative numbers of these types, together with their positions with respect\nto host galaxy properties, to investigate implications for both progenitor\ncharacteristics and star formation (SF) properties.

We draw two different -but\nnon-mutually exclusive- interpretations on the system and its supernovae: 1)\nThe distribution of SNe, and the relatively high fraction of types Ib and IIb\nevents over other type II can be explained by the young age of the most recent\nSF in the system, where insufficient time has expired for the observed to match\nthe 'true' relative SN rates.

Both ATLAS and CMS have already presented some results in terms of\nsimplified models, and we encourage them to continue and expand this effort,\nwhich supplements both signature-based results and benchmark model\ninterpretations. A simplified model is defined by an effective Lagrangian\ndescribing the interactions of a small number of new particles. Simplified\nmodels can equally well be described by a small number of masses and\ncross-sections. These parameters are directly related to collider physics\nobservables, making simplified models a particularly effective framework for\nevaluating searches and a useful starting point for characterizing positive\nsignals of new physics. This document serves as an official summary of the\nresults from the \"Topologies for Early LHC Searches\" workshop, held at SLAC in\nSeptember of 2010, the purpose of which was to develop a set of representative\nmodels that can be used to cover all relevant phase space in experimental\nsearches. Particular emphasis is placed on searches relevant for the first\n~50-500 pb-1 of data and those motivated by supersymmetric models. This note\nlargely summarizes material posted at http://lhcnewphysics.org/, which includes\nsimplified model definitions, Monte Carlo material, and supporting contacts\nwithin the theory community.

We report on\nstudies of the background radio noise levels, the radio clarity of the ice, and\nthe estimated sensitivity of the planned ARA array given these results, based\non the first five months of operation. Anthropogenic radio interference in the\nvicinity of the South Pole currently leads to a few-percent loss of data, but\nno overall effect on the background noise levels, which are dominated by the\nthermal noise floor of the cold polar ice, and galactic noise at lower\nfrequencies. We have also successfully detected signals originating from a 2.5\nkm deep impulse generator at a distance of over 3 km from our prototype\ndetector, confirming prior estimates of kilometer-scale attenuation lengths for\ncold polar ice. These are also the first such measurements for propagation over\nsuch large slant distances in ice.

We quantify BAOs using three statistics: the galaxy correlation\nfunction, power spectrum and the band-filtered estimator introduced by Xu et\nal. (2010). The results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0%\nmeasurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z=0.6 (in terms of the\nacoustic parameter \"A(z)\" introduced by Eisenstein et al.

Kol (IEEE INFOCOM, 1998). In the present work, a generalization of\nindex coding scheme, where transmitted symbols are subject to errors, is\nstudied. Error-correcting methods for such a scheme, and their parameters, are\ninvestigated. In particular, the following question is discussed: given the\nside information hypergraph of index coding scheme and the maximal number of\nerroneous symbols $\\delta$, what is the shortest length of a linear index code,\nsuch that every receiver is able to recover the required information? This\nquestion turns out to be a generalization of the problem of finding a\nshortest-length error-correcting code with a prescribed error-correcting\ncapability in the classical coding theory.\n  The Singleton bound and two other bounds, referred to as the $\\alpha$-bound\nand the $\\kappa$-bound, for the optimal length of a linear error-correcting\nindex code (ECIC) are established. For large alphabets, a construction based on\nconcatenation of an optimal index code with an MDS classical code, is shown to\nattain the Singleton bound. For smaller alphabets, however, this construction\nmay not be optimal. A random construction is also analyzed. It yields another\nimplicit bound on the length of an optimal linear ECIC.\n  Further, the problem of error-correcting decoding by a linear ECIC is\nstudied. It is shown that in order to decode correctly the desired symbol, the\ndecoder is required to find one of the vectors, belonging to an affine space\ncontaining the actual error vector. The syndrome decoding is shown to produce\nthe correct output if the weight of the error pattern is less or equal to the\nerror-correcting capability of the corresponding ECIC.\n  Finally, the notion of static ECIC, which is suitable for use with a family\nof instances of an index coding problem, is introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2011 05:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-17"}

We investigate\nformation and stability of shock waves in a one-dimensional periodic layered\nmedium by computational study of time-reversibility and entropy evolution. We\nfind that periodic layered media tend to inhibit shock formation. For small\ninitial conditions and large impedance variation, no shock formation is\ndetected even after times much greater than the time of shock formation in a\nhomogeneous medium. Furthermore, weak shocks are observed to be dynamically\nunstable in the sense that they do not lead to significant long-term entropy\ndecay. We propose a characteristic condition for admissibility of shocks in\nheterogeneous media that generalizes the classical Lax entropy condition and\naccurately predicts the formation or absence of shocks in these media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2011 12:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}
