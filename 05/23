The superfluid properties were studied\nby a torsional oscillator for adsorbed film states and pressurized liquid\nstates, both before and after the monolayer Kr preplating. In the film states,\nboth the superfluid transition temperature $T_{\\mathrm c}$ and the superfluid\ndensity decrease about 10 percent by Kr preplating. The suppression of film\nsuperfluidity is attributed to the quantum localization of $^4$He atoms by the\nrandomness in the substrate potential, which is caused by the\npreplating--induced broadening of the pore size distribution. In the\npressurized liquid states, the superfluid density $\\rho_{\\mathrm s}$ is found\nto increase by 10 percent by Kr preplating, whereas $T_{\\mathrm c}$ is\ndecreased by 2 percent at all pressures.

We do this by comparing the\nBH mass estimates to those derived by randomly reassigning the quasar\nbroad-line widths to different objects and re-calculating the BH mass. For 9000\nBH masses derived from the H_beta line we find that the distributions of\noriginal and randomized BH masses in the M_BH-redshift plane and the\nM_BH-luminosity plane are formally identical. A 2D KS test does not find a\ndifference at >90% confidence. For the MgII line (32000 quasars) we do find\nvery significant differences between the randomized and original BH masses, but\nthe amplitude of the difference is still small. The difference for the CIV line\n(14000 quasars) is 2-3sigma and again the amplitude of the difference is small.\nSubdividing the data into redshift and luminosity bins we find that the median\nabsolute difference in BH mass between the original and randomized data is\n0.025, 0.01 and 0.04 dex for H_beta, MgII and CIV respectively. The maximum\nabsolute difference is always <=0.1 dex. We investigate whether our results are\nsensitive to corrections to MgII virial masses (e.g. Onken & Kollmeier 2008).\nThese corrections do not influence our results. Moreover, the mass residual -\nEddington ratio correlation discussed by Onken & Kollmeier is more directly\nattributable to the slope of the relation between H_beta and MgII line width.\nOur results imply that the measured quasar broad-line velocity widths provide\nlittle extra information, after allowing for the mean velocity width. In this\ncase virial estimates are equivalent to M_BH L^alpha, with L/L_edd L^(1-alpha)\n(with alpha~0.5).

In connection\nto the study of the twist number of periodic orbits of standard--like maps we\nintroduce a new tool, called 1-cone function.

These activity signatures are interpreted as being\ncaused by coupling of an ionised atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What\nremains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can\nproduce the necessary level of ionisation. At these low temperatures, thermal\ngas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud\nparticles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionise the\nambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field\ncoupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks.\nHowever, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged.\n  We use results from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres to investigate\ncollisional processes. We show that ionisation by turbulence-induced dust-dust\ncollisions is the most efficient kinetic process. Dust-dust collisions alone\nare not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside\nthe cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas\nphase as separated electrons can trigger secondary non-linear processes. Cosmic\nrays are likely to increase the global level of ionisation, but their influence\ndecreases if a strong, large scale magnetic field is present as on Brown\nDwarfs.\n  We suggest that although thermal gas ionisation declines in objects across\nthe fully-convective boundary, dust charging by collisional processes can play\nan important role in the lowest mass objects. The onset of atmospheric dust may\ntherefore correlate with the anomalous X-ray and radio emission in atmospheres\nthat are cool, but charged more than expected by pure thermal ionisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 06:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Other mechanisms need to be found to explain the persistence of\nthe opacity hole in the presence of accretion, and we speculate on possible\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 10:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Computing subgraph centrality requires an expensive eigendecomposition\nof the adjacency matrix; return probability runs in half the time of the\neigendecomposition on a 2000-node network. These performance improvements are\nimportant because computationally efficient measures are necessary in order to\nanalyze large networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 12:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We find that the stochastic\nfluctuations induced by the spatial and temporal distribution of supernovae,\ntogether with the effect of spallation of nuclei, lead to mild but sensible\nviolations of the simple, leaky-box-inspired rule that the spectrum observed at\nEarth is $N(E)\\propto E^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha=\\gamma+\\delta$, where $\\gamma$\nis the slope of the cosmic ray injection spectrum at the sources. Spallation of\nnuclei, even with the small rates appropriate for He, may account for slight\ndifferences in spectral slopes between different nuclei, providing a possible\nexplanation for the recent CREAM observations. For $\\delta=1/3$ we find that\nthe slope of the proton and helium spectra are $\\sim 2.67$ and $\\sim 2.6$\nrespectively at energies above 1 TeV (to be compared with the measured values\nof $2.66\\pm 0.02$ and $2.58\\pm 0.02$). For $\\delta=0.6$ the hardening of the He\nspectra is not observed. We also comment on the effect of time dependence of\nthe escape of cosmic rays from supernova remnants, and of a possible clustering\nof the sources in superbubbles. In a second paper we will discuss the\nimplications of these different scenarios for the anisotropy of cosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 14:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 15:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The naive expectation that the anisotropy amplitude scales as D(E) is\nshown to be an oversimplification which does not reflect in the predicted\nanisotropy for any realistic distribution of the sources. The fluctuations in\nthe anisotropy pattern are dominated by nearby sources, so that predicting or\nexplaining the observed anisotropy amplitude and phase becomes close to\nimpossible. We find however that the very weak energy dependence of the\nanisotropy amplitude below $10^{5}$ GeV and the rise at higher energies, can\nbest be explained if the diffusion coefficient is $D(E)\\sim E^{1/3}$. Faster\ndiffusion, for instance with $\\delta=0.6$, leads in general to an exceedingly\nlarge anisotropy amplitude. The spiral structure introduces interesting trends\nin the energy dependence of the anisotropy pattern, which qualitatively reflect\nthe trend seen in the data. For large values of the halo size we find that the\nanisotropy becomes dominated by the large scale regular structure of the source\ndistribution, leading indeed to a monotonic increase of $\\delta_A$ with energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 15:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 15:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Specifically, we show that any sequential\nmeasurement procedure fails provided the average number of measurements per\ndimension grows slower then log s / D(f0||f1) where s is the level of sparsity,\nand D(f0||f1) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the underlying\ndistributions. For comparison, we show any non-sequential procedure fails\nprovided the number of measurements grows at a rate less than log n /\nD(f1||f0), where n is the total dimension of the problem. Lastly, we show that\na simple procedure termed sequential thresholding guarantees exact support\nrecovery provided the average number of measurements per dimension grows faster\nthan (log s + log log n) / D(f0||f1), a mere additive factor more than the\nlower bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 15:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 20:13:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 16:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}
