In the present work, we propose a model\nwhich considers cometary dust as a mixture of compact and aggregate particles,\nwith composition of silicate and organic. We consider compact particles as\nspheroidal particles and aggregates as BCCA and BAM2 aggregate with some size\ndistribution. For modeling Comet 1P/ Halley, the power-law size distribution\nn(a)= a^{-2.6}, for both compact and aggregate particles is taken. We take a\nmixture of BAM2 and BCCA aggregates with a lower and upper cutoff size around\n0.20$\\mu m$ and 1$\\mu m$. We also take a mixture of prolate, spherical and\noblate compact particles with axial ratio (E) from 0.8 to 1.2 where a lower and\nupper cutoff size around 0.1$\\mu m$ and 10$\\mu m$ are taken. Using T-matrix\ncode, the average simulated polarization curves are generated which can best\nfit the observed polarization data at the four wavelengths $\\lambda$ =\n0.365$\\mu m$, 0.485$\\mu m$, 0.670$\\mu m$ and 0.684$\\mu m$. The suitable mixing\npercentage of aggregates emerging out from the present modeling corresponds to\n50% BAM2 and 50% BCCA particles and silicate to organic mixing percentage\ncorresponds to 78% silicate and 22% organic in terms of volume. The present\nmodel successfully reproduces the observed polarization data, especially the\nnegative branch, more effectively as compared to other work done in the past.\nIt is found that among the aggregates, the BAM2 aggregate plays a major role,\nin deciding the cross-over angle and depth of negative polarization branch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 16:16:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 15:57:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 06:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Yet, the crucial questions on how\nDNA loci recognize their target and are reliably shuttled to their destination\nby Brownian diffusion are still open. Here, we complement the current\nexperimental scenario by considering a physics model, in which the interaction\nbetween distant loci is mediated by diffusing bridging molecules. We show that,\nin such a system, the mechanism underlying target recognition and\ncolocalization is a thermodynamic switch-like process (a phase transition) that\nonly occurs if the concentration and affinity of binding molecules is above a\nthreshold, or else stable contacts are not possible. We also briefly discuss\nthe kinetics of this \"passive-shuttling\" process, as produced by random\ndiffusion of DNA loci and their binders, and derive predictions based on the\neffects of genomic modifications and deletions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 17:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

A precipitous drop in the surface brightness beyond 110 AU suggests\nthat the outer disk is truncated at that distance. The radial surface-density\nprofile is peaked at both the inner ring and the outer edge of the disk. The\ndust in the outer disk scatters neutrally but isotropically, and it has a low\nV-band albedo of 0.1. We also present new Spitzer MIPS photometry and IRS\nspectra of HD 92945.

Our observations indicate a total dust mass of ~0.001\nM_earth. However, they provide contradictory evidence of the dust's physical\ncharacteristics: its neutral V-I color and lack of 24 micron emission imply\ngrains larger than a few microns, but its isotropic scattering and low albedo\nsuggest a large population of submicron-sized grains.

Instead, the spectra are well-fit by\na model of a power-law continuum obscured by a Compton-thin absorber, plus a\nsoft excess. This result is consistent with previous follow-up observations of\ntwo other flat-spectrum BAT-detected AGN. Thus, out of the six AGN in the\n22-month BAT catalog with apparently flat Swift XRT spectra, all five that have\nhad follow-up observations are not likely Compton-thick.

CNVs are commonly detected by hybridizing genomic DNA to microarrays\nof nucleic acid probes. System noise caused by operational and probe\nperformance variability complicates the interpretation of these data. To\nminimize the distortion of genetic signal by system noise, we have explored the\nlatter in an archive of hybridizations in which no genetic signal is expected.\nThis archive is obtained by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of a sample\nin one channel to the same sample in the other channel, or 'self-self' data.\nThese self-self hybridizations trap a variety of system noise inherent in\nsample-reference (test) data. Through singular value decomposition (SVD) of\nself-self data, we have determined the principal components of system noise.\nAssuming simple linear models of noise generation, the linear correction of\ntest data with self-self data -or 'system normalization'- reduces local and\nlong-range correlations and improves signal-to-noise metrics, yet does not\nintroduce detectable spurious signal. Using this method, 90% of hybridizations\ndisplayed improved signal-to-noise ratios with an average increase of 7.0%, due\nmainly to a reduced median average deviation (MAD). In addition, we have found\nthat principal component loadings correlate with specific probe variables\nincluding array coordinates, base composition, and proximity to the 5' ends of\ngenes. The correlation of the principal component loadings with the test data\ndepends on operational variables, such as the temporal order of processing and\nthe localization of individual samples within 96-well plates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 19:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

It is well known that\nthe Black Box operators induce Majorana neutrino masses at four-loop level.\nThis warrants the statement that an observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay guarantees the Majorana nature of neutrinos. We calculate these\nradiatively generated masses and find that they are many orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the observed neutrino masses and splittings. Thus, some lepton\nnumber violating New Physics (which may at tree-level not be related to\nneutrino masses) may induce Black Box operators which can explain an observed\nrate of neutrinoless double beta decay. Although these operators guarantee\nfinite Majorana neutrino masses, the smallness of the Black Box contributions\nimplies that other neutrino mass terms (Dirac or Majorana) must exist. If\nneutrino masses have a significant Majorana contribution then this will become\nthe dominant part of the Black Box operator. However, neutrinos might also be\npredominantly Dirac particles, while other lepton number violating New Physics\ndominates neutrinoless double beta decay. Translating an observed rate of\nneutrinoless double beta decay into neutrino masses would then be completely\nmisleading. Although the principal statement of the Schechter-Valle theorem\nremains valid, we conclude that the Black Box diagram itself generates\nradiatively only mass terms which are many orders of magnitude too small to\nexplain neutrino masses.

The social structure of\nseveral organization is also of interest to many researchers, such as the\naffiliations of legislators or the relationships among terrorist. A key aspect\nof studying social networks is understanding the evolutionary dynamics and the\nmechanism by which these structures grow and change over time. While current\nmethods are well suited to describe static features of networks, they are less\ncapable of specifying models of change and simulating network evolution. In the\nfollowing paper I present a new method for modeling network growth and\nevolution. This method relies on graph motifs to generate simulated network\ndata with particular structural characteristic. This technique departs notably\nfrom current methods both in form and function. Rather than a closed-form\nmodel, or stochastic implementation from a single class of graphs, the proposed\n\"graph motif model\" provides a framework for building flexible and complex\nmodels of network evolution. The paper proceeds as follows: first a brief\nreview of the current literature on network modeling is provided to place the\ngraph motif model in context. Next, the graph motif model is introduced, and a\nsimple example is provided. As a proof of concept, three classic random graph\nmodels are recovered using the graph motif modeling method: the Erdos-Renyi\nbinomial random graph, the Watts-Strogatz \"small world\" model, and the\nBarabasi-Albert preferential attachment model. In the final section I discuss\nthe results of these simulations and subsequent advantage and disadvantages\npresented by using this technique to model social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 19:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

To this end, the\nvalue of the inverse range parameter of the intermolecular potential in the\nYukawa fluid is fixed so that the ratio of the density at the critical point to\nthe liquid density at the triple point in this model coincides with the same\nratio in water. Subsequently, a (relatively simple) nonlinear rescaling of the\ntemperature is performed which allows one to obtain the full liquid vapor\ncoexistence curve of real water in the temperature-density plane with good\naccuracy, except close to the triple point.

Therefore, detailed data on the outcome of pre-planetesimal\ncollisions is required and has to be presented in a suitable and precise\nformat. We propose and apply a new classification scheme for pre-planetesimal\ncollisions based on the quantitative aspects of four fragment populations: the\nlargest and second largest fragment, a power-law population, and a\nsub-resolution population. For the simulations of pre-planetesimal collisions,\nwe adopt the SPH numerical scheme with extensions for the simulation of porous\nsolid bodies. By means of laboratory benchmark experiments, this model was\npreviously calibrated and tested for the correct simulation of the compaction,\nbouncing, and fragmentation behaviour of macroscopic highly porous silica dust\naggregates. It is shown that previous attempts to map collision data were much\ntoo oriented on qualitatively categorising into sticking, bouncing, and\nfragmentation events. We show that the four-populations model encompasses all\nprevious categorisations and in addition allows for transitions. This is\nbecause it is based on quantitative characteristic attributes of each\npopulation such as the mass, kinetic energy, and filling factor. As a\ndemonstration of the applicability and the power of the four-populations model,\nwe utilise it to present the results of a study on the influence of collision\nvelocity in head-on collisions of intermediate porosity aggregates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 19:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 11:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 13:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

After the launch of the Swift satellite, the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)\noptical light-curve smoothness paradigm has been questioned thanks to the\nfaster and better sampled optical follow-up, which has unveiled a very complex\nbehaviour. This complexity is triggering the interest of the whole GRB\ncommunity. The GROND multi-channel imager is used to study optical and\nnear-infrared (NIR) afterglows of GRBs with unprecedented optical and\nnear-infrared temporal and spectral resolution. The GRB 081029 has a very\nprominent optical rebrightening event and is an outstanding example of the\napplication of the multi-channel imager to GRB afterglows. Aims. Here we\nexploit the rich GROND multi-colour follow-up of GRB 081029 combined with XRT\nobservations to study the nature of late-time rebrightenings that appear in the\noptical-NIR light-curves of some GRB afterglows. Methods. We analyse the\noptical and NIR observations obtained with the seven-channel Gamma-Ray burst\nOptical and Near-infrared Detector (GROND) at the 2.2 m MPI/ESO telescope and\nthe X-ray data obtained with the XRT telescope on board the Swift observatory.\nThe multi-wavelength temporal and spectral evolution is discussed in the\nframework of different physical models. Results. The extremely steep optical\nand NIR rebrightening observed in GRB 081029 cannot be explained in the\nframework of the standard forward shock afterglow model. The absence of a\ncontemporaneous X-ray rebrightening and the evidence of a strong spectral\nevolution in the optical-NIR bands during the rise suggest two separate\ncomponents that dominate in the early and late-time lightcurves, respectively.\nThe steepness of the optical rise cannot be explained even in the framework of\nthe alternative scenarios proposed in the literature unless a late-time\nactivity of the central engine is assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Spectroscopic RV studies fail to reveal any\nplausible companion with a period in this range. Therefore, we conjecture that\nthe observed light-curve cusps of amplitude ~ 0.01 mag that recur at a 4.08 day\ntimescale may arise in the inner parts, or at the base of, a corotating\ninteraction region (CIR) seen in emission as it rotates around with the star at\nconstant angular velocity. The hard X-ray component seen in WR 110 could then\nbe a result of a high velocity component of the CIR shock interacting with the\nambient wind at several stellar radii. Given that most hot, luminous stars\nshowing CIRs have two CIR arms, it is possible that either the fundamental\nperiod is 8.2 days or, more likely in the case of WR 110, there is indeed a\nsecond weaker CIR arm for P = 4.08 days, that occurs ~ two thirds of a rotation\nperiod after the main CIR. If this interpretation is correct, WR 110 therefore\njoins the ranks with three other single WR stars, all WN, with confirmed CIR\nrotation periods (WR 1, WR 6, and WR 134), albeit with WR 110 having by far the\nlowest amplitude photometric modulation. This illustrates the power of being\nable to secure intense, continuous high-precision photometry from space-based\nplatforms such as MOST. It also opens the door to revealing low-amplitude\nphotometric variations in other WN stars, where previous attempts have failed.\nIf all WN stars have CIRs at some level, this could be important for revealing\nsources of magnetism or pulsation in addition to rotation periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Observations in the X-ray and centimetric\nradio wavelength ranges are thought to constrain some of these processes, e.g.,\ncoronal-type magnetic activity. There is a well-known empirical correlation of\nradio and X-ray luminosities in active stars, the so-called Guedel-Benz\nrelation. Previous evidence whether YSOs are compatible with this relation\nremains inconclusive for the earliest evolutionary stages. The main difficulty\nis that due to the extreme variability of these sources, simultaneous\nobservations are essential. Until now, only few YSOs and only a handful of\nprotostars have been observed simultaneously in the X-ray and radio range. To\nexpand the sample, we have obtained such observations of two young clusters\nrich in protostars, NGC 1333 and IC 348. While the absolute sensitivity is\nlower for these regions than for more nearby clusters like CrA, we find that\neven in deep continuum observations carried out with the NRAO Very Large Array,\nthe radio detection fraction for protostars in these clusters is much lower\nthan the X-ray detection fraction. Very few YSOs are detected in both bands,\nand we find the radio and X-ray populations among YSOs to be largely distinct.\nWe combine these new results with previous simultaneous Chandra and VLA\nobservations of star-forming regions and find that YSOs with detections in both\nbands appear to be offset toward higher radio luminosities for given X-ray\nluminosities when compared to the Guedel-Benz relation, although even in this\nsensitive dataset most sources are too weak for the radio detections to provide\ninformation on the emission processes. The considerably improved sensitivity of\nthe Expanded Very Large Array will provide a better census of the YSO radio\npopulation as well as better constraints on the emission mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 20:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In this work, we investigate the two dimensional\neffects of rotation on radiatively driven mass loss and the associated loss of\nangular momentum in ZAMS models with solar metallicity. Using 2D stellar\nmodels, which give the variation in surface parameters as a function of\nco-latitude, we implement two different mass loss prescriptions describing\nradiatively driven mass loss. We find a significant variation in mass loss\nrates and angular momentum loss as a function of co-latitude.

When\ncomparing 2D to 1D mass loss rates, we find that although the total angle\nintegrated mass loss does not differ significantly, the 2D models predict less\nmass loss from the equator and more mass loss from the pole than the 1D\npredictions using von Zeipel's law. As a result, rotating models lose less\nangular momentum in 2D than in 1D, which will change the subsequent evolution\nof the star.

The impulsively excited acoustic waves formed a compact\nwavepacket traveling through the solar interior and appearing on the surface as\nexpanding wave ripples. The initial flare impacts were observed in the form of\ncompact and rapid variations of the Doppler velocity, line-of-sight magnetic\nfield and continuum intensity. These variations formed a typical two-ribbon\nflare structure, and are believed to be associated with thermal and\nhydrodynamic effects of high-energy particles heating the lower atmosphere. The\nanalysis of the SDO/HMI and X-ray data from the Ramaty High Energy Solar\nSpectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) shows that the helioseismic waves were initiated\nby the photospheric impact in the early impulsive phase, observed prior to the\nhard X-ray (50-100 keV) impulse, and were probably associated with atmospheric\nheating by relatively low-energy electrons (~6-50 keV) and heat flux transport.\nThe impact caused a short motion in the sunspot penumbra prior to the\nappearance of the helioseismic wave. It is found that the helioseismic wave\nfront traveling through a sunspot had a lower amplitude and was significantly\ndelayed relative to the front traveling outside the spot. These observations\nopen new perspectives for studying the flare photospheric impacts and for using\nthe flare-excited waves for sunspot seismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2011 21:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In this paper we illustrate four potential WFIRST payloads that\naccomplish these objectives and that fully utilize optical and technical\nadvances made since the community input to the Decadal Survey. These\nimprovements, developed by our group, are: unobscured 1.3 or 1.5 m apertures;\nsimultaneous dual focal lengths delivering pixel scales of 0.18\" for imaging\nand 0.38\" or 0.45\" for slitless spectroscopy; the use of a prism in converging\nlight for slitless spectroscopy; and payload features that allow up to 270\ndays/year observing the Galactic Bulge. These factors combine to allow WFIRST\npayloads that provide improved survey rates compared to previous mission\nconcepts. In this report we perform direct comparisons of survey speeds for\nconstant survey depth using our optical and exposure-time tools previously\ndeveloped for JDEM.

We conclude that Earth in the warmest interglacial periods of\nthe past million years was less than 1{\\deg}C warmer than in the Holocene.\nPolar warmth in these interglacials and in the Pliocene does not imply that a\nsubstantial cushion remains between today's climate and dangerous warming, but\nrather that Earth is poised to experience strong amplifying polar feedbacks in\nresponse to moderate global warming. Thus goals to limit human-made warming to\n2{\\deg}C are not sufficient - they are prescriptions for disaster. Ice sheet\ndisintegration is nonlinear, spurred by amplifying feedbacks. We suggest that\nice sheet mass loss, if warming continues unabated, will be characterized\nbetter by a doubling time for mass loss rate than by a linear trend. Satellite\ngravity data, though too brief to be conclusive, are consistent with a doubling\ntime of 10 years or less, implying the possibility of multi-meter sea level\nrise this century. Observed accelerating ice sheet mass loss supports our\nconclusion that Earth's temperature now exceeds the mean Holocene value.

Due to the low gas density in SNe Ia with no H-envelope, the\naverage radii of the newly formed grains are generally below 0.01 micron, being\nmuch smaller than those in Type II-P SNe.

The total dust mass ranges from 3x10^{-4} M_sun to 0.2 M_sun\nfor alpha_j=0.1--1, depending on whether or not CO and SiO molecules are\nformed. We also estimate the optical depths and thermal emission by the newly\nformed dust and compare to the relevant observations of SNe Ia.

It is based on calculating the Q factor, a measure of flux-normalized\nDoppler sensitivity in the fringing spectra created with DFDI. We calculate the\nQ factor as a function of spectral resolution R, stellar projected rotational\nvelocity V sini, stellar effective temperature T_eff and optical path\ndifference (OPD) of the interferometer. We also compare the DFDI Q factor to\nthat for the popular cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph method (the direct\nechelle (DE) method). Given the IR Doppler measurement is likely to be\ndetector-limited for a while, we introduce new merit functions, which is\ndirectly related to photon-limited RV uncertainty, to evaluate Doppler\nperformance with the DFDI and DE methods. We find that DFDI has strength in\nwavelength coverage and multi-object capability over the DE for a limited\ndetector resource. We simulate the performance of the InfraRed Exoplanet\nTracker (IRET) based on the DFDI design, being considered for the next\ngeneration IR Doppler measurements. The predicted photon-limited RV uncertainty\nsuggests that IRET is capable of detecting Earth-like exoplanets in habitable\nzone around nearby bright M dwarfs if they exist. A new method is developed to\nquantitatively estimate the influence of telluric lines on RV uncertainty. Our\nstudy shows that photon-limited RV uncertainty can be reached if 99% of the\nstrength of telluric lines can be removed from the measured stellar spectra. At\nlow to moderate levels of telluric line strength removal (50% to 90%), the\noptimal RV uncertainty is typically a factor of 2-3 times larger than\nphoton-limited RV uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 06:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2011 04:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

As we\npointed out previously, the critical value corresponds to the disappearance of\nthe hole-Fermi surface. These results indicate that the carrier number solely\ndetermines the Tc value. We have not observed appreciable effects of pair\nbreaking, which originates from the nonmagnetic impurity scattering of\nconduction electrons and strongly suppresses T_c_ values of systems with\nsign-reversing of the order parameter over the Fermi surface(s). On the basis\nof the results, the so-called s_+-_ symmetry of the order parameter with the\nsign-reversing is excluded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 07:19:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 03:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The simulations consider a number of processes, such as radiative\ncooling, star formation, supernovae and feedback from active galactic nuclei\n(AGN). Van Daalen et al. (2011) used the same simulations to show that baryon\nphysics, in particular the strong feedback that is required to solve the\novercooling problem, modifies the matter power spectrum on scales relevant for\ncosmological weak lensing studies. As a result, the use of power spectra from\ndark matter simulations can lead to significant biases in the inferred\ncosmological parameters. We show that the typical biases are much larger than\nthe precision with which future missions aim to constrain the dark energy\nequation of state, w_0. For instance, the simulation with AGN feedback, which\nreproduces X-ray and optical properties of groups of galaxies, gives rise to a\n~40% bias in w_0. We demonstrate that the modification of the power spectrum is\ndominated by groups and clusters of galaxies, the effect of which can be\nmodelled. We consider an approach based on the popular halo model and show that\nsimple modifications can capture the main features of baryonic feedback.\nDespite its simplicity, we find that our model, when calibrated on the\nsimulations, is able to reduce the bias in w_0 to a level comparable to the\nsize of the statistical uncertainties for a Euclid-like mission. While\nobservations of the gas and stellar fractions as a function of halo mass can be\nused to calibrate the model, hydrodynamic simulations will likely still be\nneeded to extend the observed scaling relations down to halo masses of 10 ^12\nM_sun/h.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 13:57:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 May 2011 13:31:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 16:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

As for H2O, the main processes after UV photodissociation are\ntrapping and desorption. There are three desorption processes: D atom, OD\nradical, and D2O molecule photodesorption. D2O desorption takes places either\nby direct desorption of a recombined D2O molecule, or when an energetic D atom\nproduced by photodissociation kicks a surrounding D2O molecule out of the\nsurface by transferring part of its momentum. Desorption probabilities are\ncompared quantitatively with those for H2O obtained from previous MD\nsimulations of UV photodissociation of amorphous water ice. The main\nconclusions are the same, but the average D atom photodesorption probability is\nsmaller than that of the H atom (by about a factor of 0.9) because D has lower\nkinetic energy than H, whereas the average OD radical photodesorption\nprobability is larger than that of OH (by about a factor of 2.5-2.9 depending\non Tice) because OD has higher translational energy than OH for every Tice\nstudied. The average D2O photodesorption probability is larger than that of H2O\n(by about a factor of 1.4-2.3 depending on Tice), and this is entirely due to a\nlarger contribution of the D2O kick-out mechanism. This is an isotope effect:\nthe kick-out mechanism is more efficient for D2O ice, because the D atom formed\nafter D2O photodissociation has a larger momentum than photogenerated H atoms\nfrom H2O, and D transfers momentum more easily to D2O than H to H2O. The total\nyield has been compared with experiments and the total yield from previous\nsimulations. We find better agreement when we compare experimental yields with\ncalculated yields for D2O ice than when we compare with calculated yields for\nH2O ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 14:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-06"}

The same claim was made in November 2010, but quickly shown to\nbe false by three independent groups. The culprit was simply that Gurzadyan and\nPenrose's simulations were based on an inappropriate power spectrum. In the\nmost recent paper, they now claim that the significance is indeed low if the\nsimulations are based on the realization-specific WMAP spectrum (ie., the one\ndirectly measured from the sky maps and affected by cosmic variance), but not\nif the simulations are based on a theoretical LCDM spectrum. In this respect,\nwe note that the three independent reanalyses all based their simulations on\nthe LCDM spectrum, not the observed WMAP spectrum, and this alone should\nsuffice to show that the updated claims are also incorrect. In fact, it is\nevident from the plots shown in their new paper that the spectrum is still\nincorrect, although in a different way than in their first paper. Thus,\nGurzadyan and Penrose's new claims are just as wrong as those made in the first\npaper, and for the same reason: The simulations are not based on an appropriate\npower spectrum. Still, while this story is of little physical interest, it may\nhave some important implications in terms of scienctific sociology: Looking\nback at the background papers leading up to the present series by Gurzadyan and\nPenrose, in particular one introducing the Kolmogorov statistic, we believe one\ncan find evidence that a community based and open access referee process may be\nmore efficient at rejecting incorrect results and claims than a traditional\njournal based approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 14:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-06"}

We find a significant and negative correlation between\nthe EW of the core component, EW(core), and the blueshift of either the core\n(the peak), the wing, or the total profile of [OIII] emission; it is fairly\nstrong for the blueshift of the total profile particularly. However, both\nquantities (EW and velocity shift) generally have only weak, if any,\ncorrelations with fundamental AGN parameters such as the nuclear continuum\nluminosity at 5100 L_{5100}, black hole mass (M_{BH}), and the Eddington ratio\n(L/L_{Edd}); these correlations include the classical Baldwin effect of\nEW(core), an inverse Baldwin effect of EW(wing), and the relationship between\nvelocity shifts and \\lratio.

In all these situations one goal is to quantify and often\nthen to improve the degree of homogenisation of a substance being stirred,\nreferred to as a passive scalar or tracer. A classical measure of mixing is the\nvariance of the concentration of the scalar, which can be related to the $L^2$\nnorm of the concentration field. Recently other norms have been used to\nquantify mixing, in particular the mix-norm as well as negative Sobolev norms.\nThese norms have the advantage that unlike variance they decay even in the\nabsence of diffusion, and their decay corresponds to the flow being mixing in\nthe sense of ergodic theory. General Sobolev norms weigh scalar gradients\ndifferently, and are known as multiscale norms for mixing. We review the\napplications of such norms to mixing and transport, and show how they can be\nused to optimise the stirring and mixing of a decaying passive scalar. We then\nreview recent work on the less-studied case of a continuously-replenished\nscalar field --- the source-sink problem. In that case the flows that optimally\nreduce the norms are associated with transport rather than mixing: they push\nsources onto sinks, and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 15:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}
