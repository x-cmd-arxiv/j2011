The trick of\nkernel has been effectively and extensively applied in many areas of machine\nlearning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and kernel principal component\nanalysis (kernel PCA). Kernel trick is to define a kernel function which relies\non the inner-product of data in the feature space without knowing these feature\nspace data. In this paper, the kernel trick will be employed to extend the\nalgorithm of spectrum sensing with leading eigenvector under the framework of\nPCA to a higher dimensional feature space. Namely, the leading eigenvector of\nthe sample covariance matrix in the feature space is used for spectrum sensing\nwithout knowing the leading eigenvector explicitly. Spectrum sensing with\nleading eigenvector under the framework of kernel PCA is proposed with the\ninner-product as a measure of similarity. A modified kernel GLRT algorithm\nbased on matched subspace model will be the first time applied to spectrum\nsensing. The experimental results on simulated sinusoidal signal show that\nspectrum sensing with kernel PCA is about 4 dB better than PCA, besides, kernel\nGLRT is also better than GLRT. The proposed algorithms are also tested on the\nmeasured DTV signal. The simulation results show that kernel methods are 4 dB\nbetter than the corresponding linear methods. The leading eigenvector of the\nsample covariance matrix learned by kernel PCA is more stable than that learned\nby PCA for different segments of DTV signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2011 23:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-17"}

A very large number of\natomic processes are important for spectrum formation. Several tools for\ncalculating SN spectra exist, but they mainly focus on the very early or late\nepochs. The intermediate phase, which requires a NLTE treatment of radiation\ntransport has rarely been studied. In this paper we present a new SN radiation\ntransport code, NERO, which can look at those epochs. All the atomic processes\nare treated in full NLTE, under a steady-state assumption. This is a valid\napproach between roughly 50 and 500 days after the explosion depending on SN\ntype. This covers the post-maximum photospheric and the early and the\nintermediate nebular phase. As a test, we compare NERO to the radiation\ntransport code of Jerkstrand et al. (2011) and to the nebular code of Mazzali\net al. (2001).

Initial temperature profiles and cloud optical depths are taken from\nthe drift-phoenix brown dwarf model. As is well known, cloud particles change\nthe spectrum compared to when clouds are ignored. The clouds reduce fluxes in\nthe near-infrared spectrum and make it redder than for the clear sky case.

This flickering produces transient peaks in the observed power spectrum\nin the 15-65 min period range.

This has lead many\nauthors to suggest that there exists a causal relationship between the chemical\nstate of the gas and its ability to form stars -- in other words, the\nassumption that the gas must be molecular before star formation can occur. We\ntest this hypothesis by modelling star formation within a dense cloud of gas\nwith properties similar to a small molecular cloud using a series of different\nmodels of the chemistry, ranging from one in which the formation of molecules\nis not followed and the gas is assumed to remain atomic throughout, to one that\ntracks the formation of both H2 and CO. We find that presence of molecules in\nthe gas has little effect on the ability of the gas to form stars: star\nformation can occur just as easily in atomic gas as in molecular gas. At low\ndensities (< 10^4 cm^-3), the gas is able to cool via C+ fine-structure\nemission almost as efficiently as via CO rotational line emission, while at\nhigher densities, the main cooling process involves the transfer of energy from\ngas to dust, meaning that the presence of molecules is again unimportant.\nCooling by H2 is particularly inefficient, accounting for as little as 1\npercent of the overall cooling in the cloud. Rather than the chemical makeup,\nwe find that the most important factor controlling the rate of star formation\nis the ability of the gas to shield itself from the interstellar radiation\nfield. As this is also a prerequisite for the survival of molecules within the\ngas, our results support a picture in which molecule formation and the\nformation of cold gas are both correlated with the column density of the cloud\n-- and thus its ability to shield itself -- rather than being directly\ncorrelated with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 12:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 09:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In\nparticular, the patterns of connectivity observed in the superficial layers of\nthe visual cortex are consistent with the recurrent excitation and inhibitory\nfeedback required for cooperative-competitive circuits such as the soft\nwinner-take-all (WTA). WTA circuits offer interesting computational properties\nsuch as selective amplification, signal restoration, and decision making. But,\nthese properties depend on the signal gain derived from positive feedback, and\nso there is a critical trade-off between providing feedback strong enough to\nsupport the sophisticated computations, while maintaining overall circuit\nstability. We consider the question of how to reason about stability in very\nlarge distributed networks of such circuits. We approach this problem by\napproximating the regular cortical architecture as many interconnected\ncooperative-competitive modules. We demonstrate that by properly understanding\nthe behavior of this small computational module, one can reason over the\nstability and convergence of very large networks composed of these modules. We\nobtain parameter ranges in which the WTA circuit operates in a high-gain\nregime, is stable, and can be aggregated arbitrarily to form large stable\nnetworks. We use nonlinear Contraction Theory to establish conditions for\nstability in the fully nonlinear case, and verify these solutions using\nnumerical simulations. The derived bounds allow modes of operation in which the\nWTA network is multi-stable and exhibits state-dependent persistent activities.\nOur approach is sufficiently general to reason systematically about the\nstability of any network, biological or technological, composed of networks of\nsmall modules that express competition through shared inhibition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 14:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-17"}

We can imagine a unitary transformation which groups four non\nidentical nucleons (i.e. with different spin and isospin) close in coordinate\nspace. Those nucleons, being non identical, do not obey the Pauli principle,\nthus their relative momenta are negligibly small (just to fulfill the\nHeisenberg principle). Such a cluster can be identified with an $\\alpha$ boson.\nBut in dense nuclear matter, those $\\alpha$ particles still obey the Pauli\nprinciple since are constituted of Fermions. The ground state energy of nuclear\nmatter $\\alpha$ clusters is the same as for nucleons, thus it is degenerate. We\ncould think of $\\alpha$ particles as vortices which can now braid, for instance\nmaking $^8Be$ which leave the ground state energy unchanged. Further braiding\nto heavier clusters ($^{12}C$, $^{16}O$..) could give a different\nrepresentation of the ground state at no energy cost. In contrast d-like\nclusters (i.e. N=Z odd-odd nuclei, where N and Z are the neutron and proton\nnumber respectively) cannot describe the ground state of nuclear matter and can\nbe formed at high excitation energies (or temperatures) only.

The synthetic distributions\nare tested for compatibility with their observational counterparts by means of\nthe standard Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. A power-law dependence of tau_c on\nthe inner differential rotation leads to a more satisfactory agreement with\nobservations than a two-value prescription for tau_c, which would imply a\ndichotomy between the initially slow (P_rot > 3 d) and fast (P_rot < 3 d)\nrotators.

We show that a random walk at random time can be\nconsidered a random walk in \"alternating\" scenery, thus hinting at a mechanism\nbehind this duality. Following Cohen and Samorodnitsky [Ann. Appl. Probab. 16\n(2006) 1432-1461], we also consider alternating random reward schema associated\nto random walks at random times. Whereas random reward schema scale to local\ntime fractional stable motions, we show that the alternating random reward\nschema scale to indicator fractional stable motions. Finally, we show that one\nmay recursively \"subordinate\" random time processes to get new local time and\nindicator fractional stable motions and new stable processes in random scenery\nor at random times. When $\\alpha=2$, the fractional stable motions given by the\nrecursion are fractional Brownian motions with dyadic $H\\in(0,1)$. Also, we see\nthat \"un-subordinating\" via a time-change allows one to, in some sense, extract\nBrownian motion from fractional Brownian motions with $H<1/2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 15:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 15:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 01:43:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 05:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

In this paper, we relate the semantics of these two\nclasses of programs, namely the stable model semantics for weight constraint\nprograms and the answer set semantics based on conditional satisfaction for\naggregate programs. Both classes of programs are instances of logic programs\nwith constraints, and in particular, the answer set semantics for aggregate\nprograms can be applied to weight constraint programs. We show that the two\nsemantics are closely related. First, we show that for a broad class of weight\nconstraint programs, called strongly satisfiable programs, the two semantics\ncoincide. When they disagree, a stable model admitted by the stable model\nsemantics may be circularly justified. We show that the gap between the two\nsemantics can be closed by transforming a weight constraint program to a\nstrongly satisfiable one, so that no circular models may be generated under the\ncurrent implementation of the stable model semantics. We further demonstrate\nthe close relationship between the two semantics by formulating a\ntransformation from weight constraint programs to logic programs with nested\nexpressions which preserves the answer set semantics. Our study on the\nsemantics leads to an investigation of a methodological issue, namely the\npossibility of compact representation of aggregate programs by weight\nconstraint programs. We show that almost all standard aggregates can be encoded\nby weight constraints compactly. This makes it possible to compute the answer\nsets of aggregate programs using the ASP solvers for weight constraint\nprograms. This approach is compared experimentally with the ones where\naggregates are handled more explicitly, which show that the weight constraint\nencoding of aggregates enables a competitive approach to answer set computation\nfor aggregate programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 05:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-18"}
