Recent\nmodeling of the SiO emission across C-shocks predicts variations in the SiO\nline intensity and line shape at the precursor and intermediate-velocity\nregimes in only few years. We present high-angular resolution (3.8\"x3.3\")\nimages of the thermal SiO J=2-1 emission toward the L1448-mm outflow in two\nepochs (November 2004-February 2005, March-April 2009). Several SiO\ncondensations have appeared at intermediate velocities (20-50 km/s) toward the\nred-shifted lobe of the outflow since 2005. Toward one of the condensations\n(clump D), systematic differences of the dirty beams between 2005 and 2009\ncould be responsible for the SiO variability. At higher velocities (50-80\nkm/s), SiO could also have experienced changes in its intensity. We propose\nthat the SiO variability toward L1448-mm is due to a real SiO enhancement by\nyoung C-shocks at the internal working surface between the jet and the ambient\ngas. For the precursor regime (5.2-9.2 km/s), several narrow and faint SiO\ncomponents are detected. Narrow SiO tends to be compact, transient and shows\nelongated (bow-shock) morphologies perpendicular to the jet. We speculate that\nthese features are associated with the precursor of C-shocks appearing at the\ninterface of the new SiO components seen at intermediate velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 16:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A spot model fit to the global light curve, parametrized by the\nspin orientation of the star, predicts when the planet will transit the spots.\nObserving several spot crossings during different transits then leads to\nconstraints on the spin-orbit alignment.

We divide a two-dimensional Fermi sea into distinct wedges,\ncharacterized by the opening angle 2Theta and depth Q ~ pF, where pF is the\nFermi momentum. In each wedge, the energy is lowered by forming a single chiral\nspiral. The optimal values for Theta and Q are chosen by balancing this gain in\nenergy versus the cost of deforming the Fermi surface (which dominates at large\nTheta) and patch-patch interactions (dominant at small Theta). Using a\nnon-local four-Fermi interaction model, we estimate the gain and cost in energy\nby expanding in terms of 1/Nc (where Nc is the number of colors), lqcd/Q, and\nTheta. Due to a form factor in our non-local model, at small 1/Nc the mass gap\n(chiral condensate) is large, and the interaction among quarks and the\ncondensate local in momentum space. Consequently, interactions between\ndifferent patches are localized near their boundaries, and it is simple to\nembed many chiral spirals. We identify the dominant and subdominant terms at\nhigh density and categorize formulate an expansion in terms of lqcd/Q or Theta.\nThe kinetic term in the transverse directions is subdominant, so that\ntechniques from (1+1)-dimensional systems can be utilized. To leading order in\n1/Nc and lqcd/Q, the total gain in energy is ~ pF lqcd^2 with Theta ~\n(lqcd/pF)^{3/5}. Since Theta decreases with increasing pF, there should be\nphase transitions associated with the change in the wedge number.

The game models and the quantitative objectives are widely used in\nprobabilistic verification, planning, optimal inventory control, network\nprotocol and performance analysis.

In this\npaper we examine the preservation of these nuclearity properties including\nexactness, local liftability and the double commutant expectation property\nunder basic algebraic operations such as quotient, duality, coproducts and\ntensor products. We show that, in the finite dimensional case, exactness and\nlifting property are dual pairs, that is, an operator system $S$ is exact if\nand only if the dual operator system $S^d$ has the lifting property. Moreover,\nthe lifting property is preserved under quotients by null subspaces. Again in\nthe finite dimensional case we prove that every operator system has the\nk-lifting property in the sense that whenever $f:S -> A/I$ is a unital and\ncompletely positive map, where A is a C*-algebra and I is an ideal, then $f$\npossess a unital k-positive lift on A, for every k. This property provides a\nnovel proof of a classical result of Smith and Ward on the preservation of\nmatricial numerical ranges of an operator.\n  The Kirchberg conjecture naturally falls into this context. We show that the\nKirchberg conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the five dimensional\nuniversal operator system generated by two contraction ($S_2$) has the double\ncommutant expectation property.

After an\nintroduction we review the many dynamical models proposed over the years. A\nflexible and rather realistic model is introduced, describing the measurement\nof the $z$-component of a spin through interaction with a magnetic memory\nsimulated by a Curie--Weiss magnet, including $N \\gg1$ spins weakly coupled to\na phonon bath. Initially prepared in a metastable paramagnetic state, it may\ntransit to its up or down ferromagnetic state, triggered by its coupling with\nthe tested spin, so that its magnetization acts as a pointer.\n  A detailed solution of the dynamical equations is worked out. Conditions are\nfound, which ensure that the process satisfies the features of ideal\nmeasurements. Various imperfections are discussed, as well as attempts of\nincompatible measurements. The first steps consist in the solution of the\nHamiltonian dynamics for the spin-apparatus density matrix $D(t)$. On a longer\ntime scale, the trend towards equilibrium of the magnet produces a final state\n$D(t_{\\rm f})$ that involves correlations between the system and the\nindications of the pointer, thus ensuring registration. A difficulty lies in a\nquantum ambiguity: There exist many incompatible decompositions of the density\nmatrix $\\scriptD(t_{\\rm f})$. This difficulty is overcome by dynamics due to\nsuitable interactions within the apparatus.\n  Any subset of runs thus reaches over a brief delay a stable state which\nsatisfies the same hierarchic property as in classical probability theory.\nStandard quantum statistical mechanics alone appears sufficient to explain the\noccurrence of a unique answer in each run. Finally, pedagogical exercises are\nproposed while the statistical interpretation is promoted for teaching.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 20:37:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 15:24:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 16:30:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 10:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Here, we review the theory and observations of cluster\ndisruption, both the suggested initial rapid dissolution phase (infant\nmortality) and the longer timescale processes that affect clusters after they\nemerge from their progenitor GMCs. Over the past decade, the standard paradigm\nthat has developed is that all/most stars are formed in clusters and that the\nvast majority of these groups are disrupted over short timescales (< 10 Myr).\nThis is thought to be due to the removal of the left over gas from the\nstar-formation process, known as infant mortality. However, recent results have\nsuggested that the fraction of stars that form in clusters has been\noverestimated, with the majority being formed in unbound groups (i.e.\nassociations) which expand and disrupt without the need of invoking gas\nremoval. Dynamical measurements of young massive clusters in the Galaxy suggest\nthat clusters reach a stable equilibrium at very young (<3 Myr) ages,\nsuggesting that gas expulsion has little effect on the cluster. After the early\ndynamical phase, clusters appear to be long lived and stable objects. We use\nthe recent WFC3 image of the cluster population in M83 to test empirical\ndisruption laws and find that the lifetime of clusters strongly depends on\ntheir ambient environment. While the role of cluster mass is less well\nconstrained (due to the added parameter of the form of the cluster mass\nfunction), we find evidence suggesting that higher mass clusters survive\nlonger, and that the cluster mass function (at least in M83, outside the\nnuclear region) is truncated above ~10^5Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 20:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-13"}

A\nnumber of parameters can be fixed by inflationary physics, allowing to make\nspecific predictions for any subsequent period.

Most of these constructive\nproofs rely on Givens rotations, and none have been shown to be able to produce\nevery example of such a matrix. We introduce a new construction method that is\nable to do so. This method is based on recent advances in finite frame theory\nwhich show how to construct frames whose frame operator has a given prescribed\nspectrum and whose vectors have given prescribed lengths. This frame\nconstruction requires one to find a sequence of eigensteps, that is, a sequence\nof interlacing spectra that satisfy certain trace considerations. In this\npaper, we show how to explicitly construct every such sequence of eigensteps.\nHere, the key idea is to visualize eigenstep construction as iteratively\nbuilding a staircase. This visualization leads to an algorithm, dubbed Top\nKill, which produces a valid sequence of eigensteps whenever it is possible to\ndo so. We then build on Top Kill to explicitly parametrize the set of all valid\neigensteps.

We examine the properties of infrared (IR) emission\nfrom the inner edge of the dusty torus in AGNs, which are powered by super- or\nsub-Eddington accretion flows around black holes, by considering the dependence\nof the polar angle on the radiation flux of accretion flows (Watarai et al.\n2005). We find that for super-Eddington AGNs, of which the mass accretion rate\nis more than 10^2 times larger than the Eddington rate, the ratio of the AGN IR\nluminosity and the disc bolometric luminosity is less than 10^-2, unless the\nhalf opening angle of the torus (theta_torus) is small (theta_torus <65\ndegree). This is due to the self-occultation effect, whereby the\nself-absorption at the outer region of the super-Eddington flow dilutes the\nillumination of the torus. Such a small luminosity ratio is not observed in\nsub-Eddington AGNs, whose mass accretion rate is comparable to or no more than\n10 times larger than the Eddington mass accretion rate, except for extremely\nthin tori (theta_torus >85 degree). We also consider the properties of the\nnear-IR (NIR) emission radiated from hot dust >1000 K. We find that\nsuper-Eddington AGNs have a ratio of the NIR luminosity to the bolometric\nluminosity, L_NIR,AGN/L_bol,disc, at least one order of magnitude smaller than\nfor sub-Eddington AGNs for a wide range of half opening angle (theta_torus > 65\ndegree), for various types of dusty torus model. Thus, a relatively low\nL_NIR,AGN/L_bol,disc is a property that allows identification of candidate\nsuper-Eddington AGNs. Lastly, we discuss the possibility that NIR-faint quasars\nat redshift z=6 discovered by a recent deep SDSS survey may be young quasars\nwhose black holes grow via super-Eddington accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 03:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We introduce and investigate the Hidden\nSymmetry Subgroup Problem (HSSP), which is a generalization of the well-studied\nHidden Subgroup Problem (HSP).

The HSSP provides a\nunifying framework that, besides the HSP, encompasses a wide range of algebraic\noracle problems, including quadratic hidden polynomial problems. While the HSSP\ncan have provably exponential quantum query complexity, we obtain efficient\nquantum algorithms for various interesting cases. To achieve this, we present a\ngeneral method for reducing the HSSP to the HSP, which works efficiently in\nseveral cases related to symmetries of polynomials. The HSSP therefore connects\nin a rather surprising way certain hidden polynomial problems with the HSP.\nUsing this connection, we obtain the first efficient quantum algorithm for the\nhidden polynomial problem for multivariate quadratic polynomials over fields of\nconstant characteristic.

Aims: In our research we used high-resolution data taken with RXTE\nand INTEGRAL on a sample of bright transient and persistent pulsars, to perform\nan in-depth study of their variability on time scales comparable to the\npulsation period - \"pulse-to-pulse variability\". Methods: The high-quality data\nallowed us to collect individual pulses of different amplitude and explore\ntheir X-ray spectrum as a function of pulse amplitude.

The key for the dependence modelling is the covariance matrix of an\nunderlying latent multivariate Gaussian. Most approaches to MLE in multivariate\nprobit regression rely on MCEM algorithms to avoid computationally intensive\nevaluations of multivariate normal orthant probabilities. As an alternative to\nthe much used Gibbs sampler a new SMC sampler for truncated multivariate\nnormals is proposed. The algorithm proceeds in two stages where samples are\nfirst drawn from truncated multivariate Student $t$ distributions and then\nfurther evolved towards a Gaussian. The sampler is then embedded in a MCEM\nalgorithm. The sequential nature of SMC methods can be exploited to design a\nfully sequential version of the EM, where the samples are simply updated from\none iteration to the next rather than resampled from scratch. Recycling the\nsamples in this manner significantly reduces the computational cost. An\nalternative view of the standard conditional maximisation step provides the\nbasis for an iterative procedure to fully perform the maximisation needed in\nthe EM algorithm. The identifiability of MPM is also thoroughly discussed. In\nparticular, the likelihood invariance can be embedded in the EM algorithm to\nensure that constrained and unconstrained maximisation are equivalent. A simple\niterative procedure is then derived for either maximisation which takes\neffectively no computational time. The method is validated by applying it to\nthe widely analysed Six Cities dataset and on a higher dimensional simulated\nexample. Previous approaches to the Six Cities overly restrict the parameter\nspace but, by considering the correct invariance, the maximum likelihood is\nquite naturally improved when treating the full unrestricted model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 07:54:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 20:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

Although larval\nechinoderms are bilaterally symmetric, the adult body seems to abandon the\nlarval body plan and to develop independently a new structure with different\nsymmetries. The prevalent pentamer structure, the asymmetry of Loven's rule and\nthe variable location of the periproct and madrepore present enormous\ndifficulties in homologizing structures across the major clades, despite the\nexcellent fossil record. This irregularity in body forms seems to place\nechinoderms outside the other deuterostomes. Here I propose that the\npredominant five-ray structure is derived from a hexamer structure that is\ngrounded directly in the structure of the bilaterally symmetric larva. This\nhypothesis implies that the adult echinoderm body can be derived directly from\nthe larval bilateral symmetry and thus firmly ranks even the adult echinoderms\namong the bilaterians. In order to test the hypothesis rigorously, a model is\ndeveloped in which one ray is missing between rays IV-V (Loven's schema) or\nrays C-D (Carpenter's schema).

Due to gas-drag, collisional damping, and\nresonant shepherding, the planetary embryos repel the planetesimals away from\ntheir reach and thus they stop growing (Levison et al. 2010). This problem\npersists independently of whether the accretion took place at the current\nlocations of the ice giants or closer to the Sun. Instead of trying to push the\nrunaway/oligarchic growth of planetary embryos up to 10-15 Earth masses, we\nenvision the possibility that the planetesimal disk could generate a system of\nplanetary embryos of only 1-3 Earth masses. Then we investigate whether these\nembryos could have collided with each other and grown enough to reach the\nmasses of current Uranus and Neptune. Our results point to two major problems.\nFirst, there is typically a large difference in mass between the first and the\nsecond most massive core formed and retained beyond Saturn. Second, in many\nsimulations the final planetary system has more than two objects beyond Saturn.\nThe growth of a major planet from a system of embryos requires strong damping\nof eccentricities and inclinations from the disk of gas. But strong damping\nalso favors embryos and cores to find a stable resonant configuration, so that\nsystems with more than two surviving objects are found. In addition to these\nproblems, in order to have substantial mutual accretion among embryos, it is\nnecessary to assume that the surface density of the gas was several times\nhigher than that of the minimum-mass solar nebula. However this contrasts with\nthe common idea that Uranus and Neptune formed in a gas-starving disk, which is\nsuggested by the relatively small amount of hydrogen and helium contained in\nthe atmospheres of these planets. Only one of our simulations \"by chance\"\nsuccessfully reproduced the structure of the outer Solar System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 10:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 15:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The starting\npoint is the 2 micron all sky survey, with the next steps as: test its com-\npleteness down to low flux densities, confine it to redshifts z < 0.025, limit\nit to early Hubble type galaxies, test with B-V colors and with the FIR/Radio\nratio the possible separation in classes of sources for the ultra high energy\ncosmic rays, use the spheroidal stellar component - black hole mass\nrelationship to derive black hole masses, and test them with known black hole\nmasses. Results. The statistics are consistent with the mass function of black\nhole masses, with a rel- atively flat distribution to about 10^8 Msol, and\nthereafter a very steep spectrum. Our sample cuts off just below 10^7 Msol,\nindicating a gap for lower masses, below somewhere near 10^6 Msol. We construct\nthe sky distribution for all black holes above 10^7 Msol, 10^8 Msol, and 3 x\n10^8 Msol, and also show the sky distribution for the five redshift ranges 0.0\n- 0.005, 0.005 - 0.0010, 0.010 - 0.015, 0.015 - 0.020, and 0.020 to 0.025.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 11:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-13"}

In weighted congestion games with linear latency\nfunctions, the existence of (pure Nash) equilibria is guaranteed by potential\nfunction arguments. Unfortunately, this proof of existence is inefficient and\ncomputing equilibria is such games is a {\\sf PLS}-hard problem. The situation\ngets worse when superlinear latency functions come into play; in this case, the\nNash dynamics of the game may contain cycles and equilibria may not even exist.\nGiven these obstacles, we consider approximate equilibria as alternative\nsolution concepts. Do such equilibria exist? And if so, can we compute them\nefficiently?\n  We provide positive answers to both questions for weighted congestion games\nwith polynomial latency functions by exploiting an \"approximation\" of such\ngames by a new class of potential games that we call $\\Psi$-games. This allows\nus to show that these games have $d!$-approximate equilibria, where $d$ is the\nmaximum degree of the latency functions. Our main technical contribution is an\nefficient algorithm for computing O(1)-approximate equilibria when $d$ is a\nconstant. For games with linear latency functions, the approximation guarantee\nis $\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}+O(\\gamma)$ for arbitrarily small $\\gamma>0$; for\nlatency functions with maximum degree $d\\geq 2$, it is $d^{2d+o(d)}$. The\nrunning time is polynomial in the number of bits in the representation of the\ngame and $1/\\gamma$. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also show the\nfollowing structural statement for weighted congestion games with polynomial\nlatency functions of maximum degree $d\\geq 2$: polynomially-long sequences of\nbest-response moves from any initial state to a $d^{O(d^2)}$-approximate\nequilibrium exist and can be efficiently identified in such games as long as\n$d$ is constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 11:21:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 08:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-14"}

We propose a simple prescription to infer the angular\nbispectrum from the power spectrum of point sources considering independent\npopulations of sources, with or without clustering. We test the accuracy of our\nprediction using publicly available all-sky simulations of radio and IR sources\nand find very good agreement. We further characterise the configuration\ndependence and the frequency behaviour of the IR and radio bispectra. We show\nthat the IR angular bispectrum peaks for squeezed triangles and that the\nclustering of IR sources enhances the bispectrum values by several orders of\nmagnitude at scales l \\sim 100. At 150 GHz the bispectrum of IR sources starts\nto dominate that of radio sources on large angular scales, and it dominates\nover the whole multipole range at 350 GHz. Finally, we compute the bias on f_NL\ninduced by radio and IR sources. We show that the positive bias induced by\nradio sources is significantly reduced by masking the sources. We also show,\nfor the first time, that the form of the IR bispectrum mimics a primordial\n'local' bispectrum f_NL. The IR sources produce a negative bias which becomes\nimportant for Planck-like resolution and at high frequencies (Delta f_NL ~ -6\nat 277 GHz and Delta f_NL \\sim -60-70 at 350 GHz). Most of the signal being due\nto the clustering of faint IR sources, the bias Delta f_NL^IR is not reduced by\nmasking sources above a flux limit and may, in some cases, even be increased\ndue to the reduction of the shot-noise term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 11:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 12:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-30"}

Due to the lack of direct observations of stellar winds from Sun-like\nstars stellar X-ray luminosity and stellar level of activity are commonly used\nas a proxy for estimating stellar mass loss rates. However, such an intuitive\nactivity --- mass loss rate relation is not well defined. In this paper, I\nstudy the mass loss rate of the Sun as a function of its activity level. I\ncompare in-situ solar wind measurements with the solar activity level\nrepresented by the solar X-ray flux. I find no clear dependency of the solar\nmass flux on solar X-ray flux. Instead, the solar mass loss rate is scattered\naround an average value of $2\\cdot10^{-14}\\;M_\\odot\\;yr^{-1}$. This\nindependency of the mass loss rate on level of activity can be explained by the\nfact that the activity level is governed by the large modulations in the solar\nclose magnetic flux, while the mass loss rate is governed by the rather\nconstant open magnetic flux. I derive a simple expression for stellar mass loss\nrates as a function of the stellar ambient weak magnetic field, the stellar\nradius, the stellar escape velocity, and the average height of the Alfv\\'en\nsurface. This expression predicts stellar mass loss rates of\n$10^{-15}-10^{-12}\\;M_\\odot\\;yr^{-1}$ for Sun-like stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 13:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Aims: We investigate the dynamical\nproperties of the gas within the Coalsack. Methods: The two highest extinction\nregions were mapped with the APEX telescope in 13CO(2-1) comprising a region of\n~1 square degree. Results: In addition to the well-known, nearby gas component\naround -4km/s, we identified additional molecular gas components - in\nparticular a second extended molecular cloud at a velocity of ~-30km/s and an\nestimated distance of ~3.1kpc - that dominate the column density and visual\nextinction distributions in the northeastern part of the Coalsack. Although\ncomprising ~2600Msun, the mass of this distant cloud is distributed over an\nextent of ~73pc, much larger than typical high-mass infrared dark clouds. Its\nfilamentary structure is consistent with a compressible gaseous\nself-gravitating cylinder, and its low mass per length indicates that it may be\nstable against gravitational collapse. We find barely any mid-infrared emission\nin archival MSX data, which is indicative of almost no star-formation activity\nin the near and far cloud complexes. The nearby clouds have narrow, almost\nthermal velocity dispersions with median values between 0.2 and 0.4km/s, which\nis also consistent with low star-formation activity. Only Tapia's Globule 2\nexhibits a velocity dispersion increase toward the extinction peak and\npeak-velocity gradients over the core, which is indicative of a state of\nelevated dynamical properties. Conclusions: The Coalsack is not one single\ncoherent structure, but consists of several cloud complexes nearby as well as\nat several kpc distance.

The problem is reduced to a linear eigenvalue\nequation that involves the neutrino density, energy spectrum, angular\ndistribution, and matter density. In the single-angle case, we reproduce\nprevious results and use them to identify two generic instabilities: The system\nis stable above a cutoff density (\"cutoff mode\"), or can approach an asymptotic\ninstability for increasing density (\"saturation mode\"). We analyze multi-angle\neffects on these generic types of instabilities and find that even the\nsaturation mode is suppressed at large densities. For both types of modes, a\ngiven multi-angle spectrum typically is unstable when the neutrino and electron\ndensities are comparable, but stable when the neutrino density is much smaller\nor much larger than the electron density. The role of an instability in the SN\ncontext depends on the available growth time and on the range of affected\nmodes. At large matter density, most modes are off-resonance even when the\nsystem is unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 14:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-02"}

Two sets of objectives will be pursued.\nThe first one is to perform a set of gravitation experiments at the Solar\nSystem scale. Experimental tests of gravitation have always shown good\nagreement with General Relativity.

This approach\nenables us to gain some information about each term of the deformation to all\norders in $\\epsilon$. Concretely, we show that deformations of exact Poisson\npencils of hydrodynamic type with polynomial central invariants can be put, via\na Miura transformation, in a special form, that provides us with a tool to map\na fully deformed Poisson pencil with polynomial central invariants of a given\ndegree to a fully deformed Poisson pencil with constant central invariants to\nall orders in $\\epsilon$. In particular, this construction is applied to the so\ncalled $r$-KdV-CH hierarchy that encompasses all known examples with\nnon-constant central invariants. As far as homogeneous Poisson pencils of\nhydrodynamic type is concerned, we prove that they can also be put in a special\nform, if the central invariants are homogeneous polynomials.
