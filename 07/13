An\napplication to testing a simple null hypothesis leads the statistician to\nreport a posterior probability of the hypothesis that is informed by both\nBayesian and frequentist methodology, each weighted according how well the\nprior is known.\n  Since neither the Bayesian approach nor the frequentist approach is entirely\nsatisfactory in situations involving partial knowledge of the prior\ndistribution, the proposed procedure reduces to a Bayesian method given\ncomplete knowledge of the prior, to a frequentist method given complete\nignorance about the prior, and to a blend between the two methods given partial\nknowledge of the prior. The blended approach resembles the Bayesian method\nrather than the frequentist method to the precise extent that the prior is\nknown.\n  The problem of testing a point null hypothesis illustrates the proposed\nframework. The blended probability that the null hypothesis is true is equal to\nthe p-value or a lower bound of an unknown Bayesian posterior probability,\nwhichever is greater. Thus, given total ignorance represented by a lower bound\nof 0, the p-value is used instead of any Bayesian posterior probability. At the\nopposite extreme of a known prior, the p-value is ignored. In the intermediate\ncase, the possible Bayesian posterior probability that is closest to the\np-value is used for inference. Thus, both the Bayesian method and the\nfrequentist method influence the inferences made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 17:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

This situation has recently changed with the\ndevelopment of new computer tools for magnetic phases based on this formalism.\nIn this context we show here that, as in the case of nonmagnetic incommensurate\nsystems, the concept of superspace symmetry provides a simple, efficient and\nsystematic way to characterize the symmetry and rationalize the structural and\nphysical properties of incommensurate magnetic materials. The method introduces\nsignificant advantages over the most commonly employed method of representation\nanalysis for the description of the magnetic structure of a crystal. But, more\nimportantly, in contrast with that method, it consistently yields and\nclassifies all degrees of freedom of the system. The knowledge of the\nsuperspace group of an incommensurate magnetic material allows to predict its\ncrystal tensor properties and to rationalize its phase diagram, previous to any\nappeal to microscopic models or mechanisms. This is especially relevant when\nthe properties of incommensurate multiferroics are being studied. We present\nfirst a summary of the superspace method under a very practical viewpoint\nparticularized to magnetic modulations.

The\nactual sequence of these pulses and intervals is then followed to determine the\napproximate final wave function from which the interference pattern can be\ncalculated. The exact evolution between pulses is assumed to be governed by the\nGross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation whose solution is approximated using a\nLagrangian Variational Method to facilitate rapid prototyping.

The loop is aligned\ntowards the observer's line-of-sight and shows downflows (redshifts) of around\n15 km/s up to a temperature of 0.8 MK, but for temperatures of 1.0 MK and above\nthe measured velocity shifts are consistent with no net flow. This velocity\nresult applies over a projected spatial distance of 9 Mm and demonstrates that\nthe cooler, redshifted plasma is physically disconnected from the hotter,\nstationary plasma. A scenario in which the fan loops consist of at least two\ngroups of \"strands\" - one cooler and downflowing, the other hotter and\nstationary -- is suggested. The cooler strands may represent a later\nevolutionary stage of the hotter strands. A density diagnostic of Mg VII was\nused to show that the electron density at around 0.8 MK falls from 3.2 x 10^9\ncm^-3 at the loop base, to 5.0 x 10^8 cm^-3 at a projected height of 15 Mm.

We proceed\nto discuss the physics of charged modes as we move between different points in\nthe moduli space of F-theory compactified on K3. In particular, we show how, in\ngoing from the E6^3 point to the SO(8)^4 point, the structure of SO(8) zero\nmodes arises from a non-trivial mixing of massless 27's of E6 with massive\nmodes stretching between different E6 stacks.

For this\npurpose we generate star cluster models with different degrees of mass\nsegregation and fractal substructure and analyse them. We quantify mass\nsegregation by measuring, from the projected 2d model data, the mass function\nslope in radial annuli, by looking for colour gradients in radial colour\nprofiles, by measuring Allison's Lambda parameter, and by determining the local\nstellar surface density around each star.

To maximise the robustness of our results we\nhave carefully selected two SDSS quasars at z~4. These quasars are\nrepresentative of the most luminous quasars known at this epoch but they also,\ncrucially, lie within 40 arcsec of comparably-bright foreground stars (required\nfor accurate PSF definition), and have redshifts which ensure line-free Ks-band\nimaging.

The quasar host galaxies have K-band luminosities similar to radio\ngalaxies at comparable redshifts, suggesting that these quasar hosts are also\namong the most massive galaxies in existence at this epoch.

To this day, it is still\nunclear which mechanism creates such QPPs. In this paper, we analyze four\nbright solar flares which show compelling signatures of quasi-periodic behavior\nand were observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (\\gbm) onboard the Fermi\nsatellite. Because GBM covers over 3 decades in energy (8 keV to 40 MeV) it can\nbe a key instrument to understand the physical processes which drive solar\nflares. We tested for periodicity in the time series of the solar flares\nobserved by GBM by applying a classical periodogram analysis. However, contrary\nto previous authors, we did not detrend the raw light curve before creating the\npower spectral density spectrum (PSD). To assess the significance of the\nfrequencies we made use of a method which is commonly applied for X-ray\nbinaries and Seyfert galaxies. This technique takes into account the underlying\ncontinuum of the PSD which for all of these sources has a P(f) ~ f^{-\\alpha}\ndependence and is typically labeled red-noise. We checked the reliability of\nthis technique by applying it to a solar flare which was observed by the Reuven\nRamaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) which contains, besides\nany potential periodicity from the Sun, a 4 s rotational period due to the\nrotation of the spacecraft around its axis. While we do not find an intrinsic\nsolar quasi-periodic pulsation we do reproduce the instrumental periodicity.\nMoreover, with the method adopted here, we do not detect significant QPPs in\nthe four bright solar flares observed by GBM. We stress that for the purpose of\nsuch kind of analyses it is of uttermost importance to appropriately account\nfor the red-noise component in the PSD of these astrophysical sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2011 16:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We know\nthat the usual quadratic action is renormalizable but suffers of the unitarity\nproblem because of the presence of a ghost (state of negative norm) in the\ntheory. The new theory is instead ghost-free since the introduction of (in\ngeneral) two entire functions in the model with the property do not introduce\nnew poles in the propagator. The local high derivative theory is recovered\nexpanding the entire functions to the lowest order in the mass scale of the\ntheory. Any truncation of the entire functions gives rise to the unitarity\nviolation but if we keep all the infinite series we do not fall into these\ntroubles. The theory is renormalizable at one loop and finite from two loops\non. Since only a finite number of graphs are divergent then the theory is\nsuper-renormalizable. We analyze the fractal properties of the theory at high\nenergy showing a reduction of the spacetime dimension at short scales.

We use a two-stretch template-fitting\nmethod to measure the rise and decline of BV light curves. Our analysis of 61\nSNe with high-quality light curves indicates that the longer the time between\nexplosion and maximum light (i.e., the rise time), the slower the decline of\nthe light curve after maximum. However, SNe with slower post-maximum decline\nrates have a faster rise than would be expected from a single-parameter family\nof light curves, indicating that SN Ia light curves are not a single-parameter\nfamily of varying widths. Comparison of the B-band rise-time distribution for\nspectroscopically normal SNe Ia to those exhibiting high-velocity spectral\nfeatures indicates that high-velocity (HV) SNe Ia have shorter B-band rise\ntimes compared to their spectroscopically normal counterparts. After\nnormalising the B-band light curves to Dm15(B)= 1.1 mag (i.e., correcting the\npost-maximum decline to have the same shape as our template), we find that\nspectroscopically normal SNe Ia have a rise time of 18.03 +/- 0.24 d, while HV\nSNe have a faster B-band rise time of 16.63 +/- 0.29 d. Despite differences in\nthe B band, we find that HV and normal SNe Ia have similar rise times in the V\nband. The initial rise of a SN Ia B-band light curve follows a power law with\nindex 2.20 +0.27 -0.19, consistent with a parabolic rise in flux predicted by\nan expanding fireball toy model. We compare our early-time B-band data to\nmodels for the predicted signature of companion interaction arising from the\nsingle-degenerate progenitor scenario. There is a substantial degree of\ndegeneracy between the adopted power-law index of the SN light-curve template,\nthe rise time, and the amount of shock emission required to match the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 20:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-23"}

For example, for highly inclined\ntriple systems, the Kozai-Lidov mechanism can produce large-amplitude\noscillations of the eccentricities and inclinations. Here we revisit the\nsecular dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. We derive the secular\nevolution equations to octupole order in Hamiltonian perturbation theory.

The nature of the burning depends on the turbulent Damkohler\nnumber (Da), which steadily declines from much greater than one to less that\none as the density decreases to a few 10^6 g/cc. Scaling arguments predict that\nthe turbulent flame speed s, normalized by the turbulent intensity u, follows\ns/u=Da^1/2 for Da<1. The flame in this regime is a single turbulently-broadened\nstructure that moves at a steady speed, and has a width larger than the\nintegral scale of the turbulence. The scaling is predicted to break down at\nDa=1, and the flame burns as a turbulently-broadened effective unity Lewis\nnumber flame. We refer to this kind of flame as a lambda-flame. The burning\nbecomes a collection of lambda-flames spread over a region approximately the\nsize of the integral scale. While the total burning rate continues to have a\nwell-defined average, s_{T} ~ u, the burning is unsteady. We present a\ntheoretical framework, supported by both 1D and 3D numerical simulations, for\nthe burning in these two regimes. Our results indicate that the average value\nof s can actually be roughly twice u for Da>1, and that localized excursions to\nas much as five times u can occur. The lambda-flame speed and width can be\npredicted based on the turbulence in the star and the turbulent nuclear burning\ntime scale of the fuel. We propose a practical method for measuring these based\non the scaling relations and small-scale computationally-inexpensive\nsimulations. This suggests that a simple turbulent flame model can be easily\nconstructed suitable for large-scale distributed supernovae flames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 21:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-14"}

High observed emission measure, as well as inference\nof electron thermalization within the small source region, both provide\nevidence of high densities at the looptop; typically more than an order of\nmagnitude above ambient. Where some investigators have suggested such density\nenhancement results from a rapid enhancement in the magnetic field strength, we\npropose an alternative model, based on Petschek reconnection, whereby looptop\nplasma is heated and compressed by slow magnetosonic shocks generated\nself-consistently through flux retraction following reconnection. Under steady\nconditions such shocks can enhance density by no more than a factor of four.\nThese steady shock relations (Rankine-Hugoniot relations) turn out to be\ninapplicable to Petschek's model owing to transient effects of thermal\nconduction. The actual density enhancement can in fact exceed a factor of ten\nover the entire reconnection outflow. An ensemble of flux tubes retracting\nfollowing reconnection at an ensemble of distinct sites will have a collective\nemission measure proportional to the rate of flux tube production. This rate,\ndistinct from the local reconnection rate within a single tube, can be measured\nseparately through flare ribbon motion.

The 3-dimensional Ric of a spacelike surface vanishes at the\nmoment of time symmetry for vacuum spacetimes. The 4-dimensional Ric is the\nEinstein tensor for such spacetimes. More recently the Ric was used by Hamilton\nto define a non-linear, diffusive Ricci flow (RF) that was fundamental to\nPerelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture. Analytic applications of RF can be\nfound in many fields including general relativity and mathematics.

In this paper, we use Regge calculus (RC) to provide\nthe first geometric discretization of the Ric. This result is fundamental for\nhigher-dimensional generalizations of discrete RF. We construct this tensor on\nboth the simplicial lattice and its dual and prove their equivalence. We show\nthat the Ric is an edge-based weighted average of deficit divided by an\nedge-based weighted average of dual area -- an expression similar to the\nvertex-based weighted average of the scalar curvature reported recently.

An\nepidemic model describes how infections spread throughout a network. Among the\ncompartmental models used to describe epidemics, the\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model has been widely used. In the SIS\nmodel, each node can be susceptible, become infected with a given infection\nrate, and become again susceptible with a given curing rate. In this paper, we\nadd a new compartment to the classic SIS model to account for human response to\nepidemic spread. Each individual can be infected, susceptible, or alert.\nSusceptible individuals can become alert with an alerting rate if infected\nindividuals exist in their neighborhood. An individual in the alert state is\nless probable to become infected than an individual in the susceptible state;\ndue to a newly adopted cautious behavior. The problem is formulated as a\ncontinuous-time Markov process on a general static graph and then modeled into\na set of ordinary differential equations using mean field approximation method\nand the corresponding Kolmogorov forward equations. The model is then studied\nusing results from algebraic graph theory and center manifold theorem. We\nanalytically show that our model exhibits two distinct thresholds in the\ndynamics of epidemic spread. Below the first threshold, infection dies out\nexponentially. Beyond the second threshold, infection persists in the steady\nstate. Between the two thresholds, the infection spreads at the first stage but\nthen dies out asymptotically as the result of increased alertness in the\nnetwork. Finally, simulations are provided to support our findings. Our results\nsuggest that alertness can be considered as a strategy of controlling the\nepidemics which propose multiple potential areas of applications, from\ninfectious diseases mitigations to malware impact reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 04:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-14"}

LBMPC improves\nperformance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned\ndynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same\ninputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty.\nFurthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC\ncontrol action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the\ntrue dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 08:34:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2012 00:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

Killing and/or branching of\ntilde{x}_{t}-particles occur at some space-dependent rate lambda. For this\ntransformed process, so in the class of branching diffusions, the question\narises as to whether the particle system is sub-critical, critical or\nsuper-critical. In the first two cases, extinction occurs with probability one.\nWe apply this circle of ideas to diffusion processes arising in population\ngenetics. In this setup, the process x_{t} is a Wright-Fisher (WF) diffusion,\neither neutral or with mutations. We study a particular Doob transform which is\nbased on the exponential function in the usual fitness parameter sigma. We have\nin mind that this is an alternative way to introduce selection or fitness in\nboth WF-like diffusions, leading to branching diffusion models ideas. For this\nDoob-transform model of fitness, the usual selection drift sigma x(1-x) should\nbe superposed to the one of x_{t} to form tilde{x}_{t} which is the process\nthat can branch, binarily. In the first neutral case, there is a trade-off\nbetween branching events giving birth to new particles and absorption at the\nboundaries, killing the particles. Under our assumptions, the branching\ndiffusion process gets eventually globally extinct in finite time with\nexponential tails. In the second case with mutations, there is a trade-off\nbetween killing events removing some particles from the system and reflection\nat the boundaries where the particles survive. This branching diffusion process\nalso gets eventually globally extinct but in very long finite time with\npower-law tails. Our approach relies on the spectral expansion of the\ntransition probability kernels of both x_{t} and tilde{x}_{t}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 09:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-15"}

The first solution with a long\nlever arm and a wide jet radius effectively brakes the star and can be applied\nto the visible jets of T Tauri stars, such as RY Tau. The second solution with\na shorter lever arm and a very narrow jet radius may explain why similar stars,\neither Weak line T Tauri Stars (WTTS) or Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTS) do not\nall have visible jets. For instance, RY Tau itself seems to have different\nphases that probably depend on the activity of the star.\n  Conclusions: First, stellar jets seem to be able to brake pre-main sequence\nstars with a low mass accreting rate. Second, jets may be visible only part\ntime owing to changes in their boundary conditions. We also suggest a possible\nscenario for explaining the dichotomy between CTTS and WTTS, which rotate\nfaster and do not have visible jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 10:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

More\nspecifically, the measure of the support of the fading-process power spectral\ndensity (PSD) determines if noncoherent capacity grows logarithmically in SNR\nor slower than logarithmically. Such a result is unsatisfactory from an\nengineering point of view, as the support of the PSD cannot be determined\nthrough measurements. The aim of this paper is to assess whether, for general\ncontinuous-time Rayleigh-fading channels, this sensitivity has a noticeable\nimpact on capacity at SNR values of practical interest.\n  To this end, we consider the general class of band-limited continuous-time\nRayleigh-fading channels that satisfy the wide-sense stationary\nuncorrelated-scattering (WSSUS) assumption and are, in addition, underspread.\nWe show that, for all SNR values of practical interest, the noncoherent\ncapacity of every channel in this class is close to the capacity of an AWGN\nchannel with the same SNR and bandwidth, independently of the measure of the\nsupport of the scattering function (the two-dimensional channel PSD). Our\nresult is based on a lower bound on noncoherent capacity, which is built on a\ndiscretization of the channel input-output relation induced by projecting onto\nWeyl-Heisenberg (WH) sets. This approach is interesting in its own right as it\nyields a mathematically tractable way of dealing with the mutual information\nbetween certain continuous-time random signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 11:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 12:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-29"}

A correct interpretation of star formation\nrate (SFR) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxy\nformation and evolution. Unfortunately, however, no single SFR estimator is\nuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerous\ngalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yield\nsignificant detections with most standard SFR measures, and until now there\nhave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span all\nthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. To address this need\nin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types of\nstar-forming galaxies in the local Universe. This project, the Star Formation\nReference Survey (SFRS), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearby\ngalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, SFR, and\nspecific SFR. Furthermore, because the SFRS is blind with respect to AGN\nfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of these\nfactors on SFR. Our panchromatic global flux measurements (including GALEX\nFUV+NUV, SDSS ugriz, 2MASS JHKs, Spitzer 3-8{\\mu}m, and others) furnish uniform\nSFR measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. This\npaper describes the SFRS survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents the\nmulti-band photometry collected to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 15:14:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 19:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The dominant oscillation frequency is set by the ratio\nbetween the sliding velocity and the period of the grooves. A mechanical model\nis proposed that provides a quantitative prediction for the amplitude of the\nforce modulations as a function of the normal load, the period of the grooves\nand the roughness characteristics of the substrate. The model's main ingredient\nis the non-linearity of the friction law.
