Our recent analysis\nsuggests the possibility of one more substantial fluctuation before the final\ncollapse in July 2011. On the other hand, in early 2011 we detected a number of\nother commodity bubbles and forecasted the start of their collapse in May -\nJune 2011. We demonstrate that this collapse has actually begun, which in\nconjunction with the forthcoming burst of the gold bubble suggests that the\nWorld System is entering a bifurcation zone bearing rather high risks of the\nsecond wave of the global financial-economic crisis. Indeed, on the one hand,\nit is obvious that such a collapse may lead to huge losses or even bankruptcies\nof many of the major participants of exchange games and their dependent firms\nand banks. Therefore, the immediate market reaction is likely to be entirely\nnegative. Negative impact on the market could well be amplified by numerous\npublications in the media and business press, drawing analogies with the events\nof the early 1980s and earlier similar events, as well as by losses of\nshareholders of bankrupt companies. On the other hand, investments in gold also\nlead to the diversion of funds from stock market investments and to the\nreduction in the production of goods and services. If at the time of the\ncollapse some promising areas of investment appear in the developed and / or\ndeveloping countries, the investment can move to those markets, which, on the\ncontrary, could contribute to the production of new goods and services and\naccelerate the way out of the crisis. It is also obvious that the decline of\nthe oil (and other energy/mineral resources) prices may contribute to\nacceleration of world economic growth rates and world economic recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2011 17:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-05"}

We have analyzed data obtained with NASA's\nKepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant stars\nlocated in either of the three open clusters, NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811.\nBy fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relations\nthat depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that the\ndata cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio as\npreviously assumed. As a result we provide a new improved empirical relation\nwhich treats luminosity and mass separately. This relation turns out to also\nwork remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. In addition, the\nmeasured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previously\nunknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, pointing\nto an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into the\nformation history of open clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We\nhave produced a new decomposition of NGC 4013, considering three stellar\nflattened components (thin+thick disk plus an extra and more extended\ncomponent) and one gaseous disk. All four components are considered to be\ngravitationally coupled and isothermal. To do so, we have used the 3.6micron\nimages from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G). We find\nevidence for NGC4013 indeed having a thin and a thick disk and an extra\nflattened component. This smooth and extended component (scaleheight z_EC kpc)\ncould be interpreted as a thick disk or as a squashed ellipsoidal halo and\ncontains ~20% of the total mass of all three stellar components. We argue it is\nunlikely to be related to the ongoing merger or due to the off-plane stars from\na warp in the other two disk components. Instead, we favor a scenario in which\nthe thick disk and the extended component were formed in a two-stage process,\nin which an initially thick disk has been dynamically heated by a merger soon\nenough in the galaxy history to have a new thick disk formed within it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 05:53:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 01:57:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 07:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A\ntypical example is the separation of riparian vegetation from ground in fluvial\nenvironments, the distinction between fresh surfaces and rockfall in cliff\nenvironments, or more generally the classification of surfaces according to\ntheir morphology. Natural surfaces are heterogeneous and their distinctive\nproperties are seldom defined at a unique scale, prompting the use of\nmulti-scale criteria to achieve a high degree of classification success. We\nhave thus defined a multi-scale measure of the point cloud dimensionality\naround each point, which characterizes the local 3D organization. We can thus\nmonitor how the local cloud geometry behaves across scales. We present the\ntechnique and illustrate its efficiency in separating riparian vegetation from\nground and classifying a mountain stream as vegetation, rock, gravel or water\nsurface. In these two cases, separating the vegetation from ground or other\nclasses achieve accuracy larger than 98 %. Comparison with a single scale\napproach shows the superiority of the multi-scale analysis in enhancing class\nseparability and spatial resolution. The technique is robust to missing data,\nshadow zones and changes in point density within the scene. The classification\nis fast and accurate and can account for some degree of intra-class\nmorphological variability such as different vegetation types. A probabilistic\nconfidence in the classification result is given at each point, allowing the\nuser to remove the points for which the classification is uncertain. The\nprocess can be both fully automated, but also fully customized by the user\nincluding a graphical definition of the classifiers. Although developed for\nfully 3D data, the method can be readily applied to 2.5D airborne lidar data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 07:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 04:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 21:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-25"}

We\npresent deep GALEX near and far ultraviolet observations, used as a recent star\nformation tracer, and we compare them with new, high resolution (16\", or 1.6\nkpc) VLA HI observations. The UV and HI maps show good spatial correlation\noutside the inner 1', where the HI phase dominates over H_2. Star-forming\nregions in the extended gaseous disk are mainly located along the enhanced HI\nemission within two (relatively) symmetric giant gaseous spiral arm-like\nfeatures, which emulate a HI pseudo-ring at a r \\simeq 3' . Inside such\nstructure, two smaller gaseous spiral arms extend from the NE and SW of the\noptical disk and connect to the previously mentioned HI pseudo-ring.\nInterestingly, we find that the (atomic) Kennicutt-Schmidt power law index\nsystematically decreases with radius, from N \\simeq 3.0 +- 0.3 in the inner\ndisk (0.'8 - 1.'7) to N = 1.6 +- 0.5 in the outskirts of the gaseous disk (3.'3\n- 4.'2). Although the star formation efficiency (SFE), the star formation rate\nper unit of gas, decreases with radius where the HI component dominates as is\ncommon in galaxies, we find that there is a break of the correlation at r = 1.5\nr_25. At radii 1.5 r_25 < r < 3.5 r_25, mostly within the HI pseudo-ring\nstructure, there exist regions whose SFE remains nearly constant, SFE \\simeq\n10^-11 yr^-1. We discuss about possible mechanisms that might be triggering the\nstar formation in the outskirts of this galaxy, and we suggest that the\nconstant SFE for such large radii r > 2 r_25 and at such low surface densities\nmight be a common characteristic in extended UV disk galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 10:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The link between the observed oscillatory motions and the eruption\noccurrence is investigated in detail for two different events.\n  Method: Two filaments are analysed using two different datasets: time series\nof spectra using a transition region line (He I at 584.33 A) and a coronal line\n(Mg X at 609.79 A) measured with CDS on-board SOHO, observed on May 30, 2003,\nand time series of intensity and velocity images from the NSO/Dunn Solar\nTelescope in the Halpha line on September 18, 1994 for the other.

Both filaments exhibit vertical oscillating\nmotions. For the filament observed in the UV (He I and Mg X lines), we provide\nevidence of damped velocity oscillations, and for the filament observed in the\nvisible (Halpha line), we provide evidence that parts of the filament are\noscillating, while the filament is moving over the solar surface, before its\ndisappearance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 11:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We report here on a study of\nHI profile asymmetries (e.g., lopsidedness) in a sample of some of the most\nisolated galaxies in the local Universe. This presents us with an excellent\nopportunity to quantify the range of intrinsic HI asymmetries and provides us\nwith a zero-point calibration for evaluating these measurements in less\nisolated samples. We characterize the HI profile asymmetries and search for\ncorrelations between HI asymmetry and their environments, as well as their\noptical and far infrared (FIR) properties. We use high signal-to-noise global\nHI profiles for galaxies in the AMIGA project (http://amiga.iaa.csic.es). We\nrestrict our study to N=166 galaxies with accurate measures of the HI shape\nproperties. We quantify asymmetries using a flux ratio parameter. The asymmetry\nparameter distribution of our isolated sample is well described by a Gaussian\nmodel. The width of the distribution is sigma=0.13, and could be even smaller\n(sigma=0.11) if instrumental errors are reduced. Only 2% of our carefully\nvetted isolated galaxies sample show an asymmetry in excess of 3sigma.

While the flux rope was rising from the active\nregion, an M1.1/2F class flare was triggered nearby one of its footpoints. We\nsuggest that the flare triggering was due to the reconnection of a rising flux\nrope with the surrounding low-lying magnetic loops. The flux rope reached a\nprojected height of ~0.15 Rs with a speed of ~90 km/s while the soft X-ray flux\nenhanced gradually during its rise. The flux rope was suppressed by an\noverlying field and the filled plasma moved towards the negative polarity field\nto the west of its activation site. We find the first observational evidence of\nthe initial suppression of a flux rope due to a remnant filament visible both\nat chromospheric and coronal temperatures that evolved couple of days before at\nthe same location in the active region.

The central\nidea consists in expressing the system energy density matrix in terms of\nGreen's functions. In order to validate our implementation we perform a series\nof benchmark calculations, both at zero and finite bias. Firstly we evaluate\nthe current-induced forces acting over an Al nanowire and compare them with\npreviously published results for fixed geometries. Then we perform structural\nrelaxation of the same wires under bias and determine the critical voltage at\nwhich they break. We find that, while a perfectly straight wire does not break\nat any of the voltages considered, a zigzag wire is more fragile and snaps at\n1.4 V, with the Al atoms moving against the electron flow. Finally we\ndemonstrate the capability of our scheme to tackle the electromigration problem\nby studying the current-induced motion of a single Si atom covalently attached\nto the sidewall of a (4,4) armchair single-walled carbon nanotube.

Slow Rotator and Fast Rotator\nE/S0 galaxies do not populate distinct locations in the scaling relations,\nalthough Slow Rotators display a smaller intrinsic scatter. Surprisingly,\nextremely young objects do not display the bluest (V-[3.6]) colours in our\nsample, as is usually the case in optical colours. This can be understood in\nthe context of the large contribution of TP-AGB stars to the infrared, even for\nyoung populations, resulting in a very tight (V-[3.6]) - se relation that in\nturn allows us to define a strong correlation between metallicity and velocity\ndispersion. Many Sa galaxies appear to follow the Fundamental Plane defined by\nE/S0 galaxies. Galaxies that appear offset from the relations correspond mostly\nto objects with extremely young populations, with signs of on-going, extended\nstar formation. We correct for this effect in the Fundamental Plane, by\nreplacing luminosity with stellar mass using an estimate of the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio, so that all galaxies are part of a tight, single relation.\nThe new estimated coefficients are consistent in both photometric bands and\nsuggest that differences in stellar populations account for about half of the\nobserved tilt with respect to the virial prediction.

Recent studies have proposed to use optical variability or near-IR\ncolors to improve the identifications of the missing quasars in this redshift\nrange. Here we present a case study by combining both factors. We select a\nsample of 70 quasar candidates from variables in SDSS Stripe 82, which are\nnon-UV excess sources and have UKIDSS near-IR public data. They are clearly\nseparated into two parts on the Y-K/g-z color-color diagram, and 59 of them\nmeet or lie close to a newly proposed Y-K/g-z selection criterion for z<4\nquasars. 44 of these 59 sources have been previously identified as quasars in\nSDSS DR7, and 35 among them are quasars at 2.2<z<3.

The very high quality of the spectrum\nallows us to investigate the ionized outflow with an unprecedented accuracy due\nto the long exposure and the use of the RGS multipointing mode. We detect\nmultiple absorption lines from the interstellar medium and from the ionized\nabsorber in Mrk 509. A number of emission components are also detected,\nincluding broad emission lines consistent with an origin in the broad line\nregion, the narrow OVII forbidden emission line and also (narrow) radiative\nrecombination continua. The ionized absorber consists of two velocity\ncomponents (v = -13 \\pm 11 km/s and v = -319 \\pm 14 km/s), which both are\nconsistent with earlier results, including UV data. There is another tentative\ncomponent outflowing at high velocity, -770 \\pm 109 km/s, which is only seen in\na few highly ionized absorption lines. The outflow shows discrete ionization\ncomponents, spanning four orders of magnitude in ionization parameter. Due to\nthe excellent statistics of our spectrum, we demonstrate for the first time\nthat the outflow in Mrk 509 in the important range of log xi between 1-3 cannot\nbe described by a smooth, continuous absorption measure distribution, but\ninstead shows two strong, discrete peaks. At the highest and lowest ionization\nparameters we cannot differentiate smooth and discrete components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 15:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

During our\ncampaign, Mrk 509 was also observed with Swift for a period of about 100 days,\nmonitoring the behaviour of the source before and after the XMM-Newton\nobservations. With these data we have established the continuum spectrum in the\noptical-UV and X-ray bands and investigated its variability on the timescale of\nour campaign with a resolution time of a few days. In order to measure and\nmodel the continuum as far as possible into the UV, we also made use of HST/COS\nobservations of Mrk 509 (part of our coordinated campaign) and of an archival\nFUSE observation. We have found that in addition to an X-ray power-law, the\nspectrum displays soft X-ray excess emission below 2 keV, which interestingly\nvaries in association with the thermal optical-UV emission from the accretion\ndisc. The change in the X-ray power-law component flux (albeit smaller than\nthat of the soft excess), on the other hand, is uncorrelated to the flux\nvariability of the soft X-ray excess and the disc component on the probed\ntimescale. The results of our simultaneous broad-band spectral and timing\nanalysis suggest that, on a resolution time of a few days, the soft X-ray\nexcess of Mrk 509 is produced by the Comptonisation of the thermal optical-UV\nphotons from the accretion disc by a warm (0.2 keV) optically thick (tau ~ 17)\ncorona surrounding the inner regions of the disc. This makes Mrk 509, with a\nblack hole mass of about 1-3 x 10^8 solar masses, the highest mass known system\nto display such behaviour and origin for the soft X-ray excess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 15:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Our high S/N\nspectrum detects additional complexity in the absorption troughs from a variety\nof sources in Mrk 509, including the outflow from the active nucleus, the ISM\nand halo of the host galaxy, and infalling clouds or stripped gas from a merger\nthat are illuminated by the AGN. Variability between the STIS and COS\nobservation of the -400 km/s component allows us to set an upper limit on its\ndistance of < 250 pc. Similarly, variability of a component at +150 km/s\nbetween two prior FUSE observations limits its distance to < 1.5 kpc. The UV\nabsorption only partially covers the emission from the AGN nucleus. Covering\nfractions are lower than those previously seen with STIS, and are comparable to\nthose seen with FUSE. Given the larger apertures of COS and FUSE compared to\nSTIS, we favor scattered light from an extended region near the AGN as the\nexplanation for the partial covering. As observed in prior X-ray and UV\nspectra, the UV absorption has velocities comparable to the X-ray absorption,\nbut the bulk of the ultraviolet absorption is in a lower ionization state with\nlower total column density than the gas responsible for the X-ray absorption.\nWe conclude that the outflow from the active nucleus is a multiphase wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 15:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
