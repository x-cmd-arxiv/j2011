As a result, it is common\nto adopt an effective one-component description of the structure that ignores\nthe differences between particle types. Unfortunately, whether this kind of\nsimplified description preserves or averages out information important for\nunderstanding the behavior of the fluid depends on the degree of polydispersity\nand can be difficult to assess, especially when the corresponding\nmulticomponent description of the pair correlations is unavailable for\ncomparison. Here, we present a computer simulation study that examines the\nimplications of adopting an effective one-component structural description of a\npolydisperse fluid. The square-well model that we investigate mimics key\naspects of the experimental behavior of suspended colloids with short-range,\npolymer-mediated attractions. To characterize the partial pair-correlation\nfunctions and thermodynamic excess entropy of this system, we introduce a Monte\nCarlo sampling strategy appropriate for fluids with a large number of\npseudo-components. The data from our simulations at high particle\nconcentrations, as well as exact theoretical results for dilute systems, show\nhow qualitatively different trends between structural order and particle\nattractions emerge from the multicomponent and effective one-component\ntreatments, even with systems characterized by moderate polydispersity. We\nexamine consequences of these differences for excess-entropy based scalings of\nshear viscosity, and we discuss how use of the multicomponent treatment reveals\nsimilarities between the corresponding dynamic scaling behaviors of attractive\ncolloids and liquid water that the effective one-component analysis does not\ncapture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 16:46:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2011 21:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-12"}

In general, the main\nlimitations faced by GRN inference methods is the small number of samples with\nhuge dimensionalities and the noisy nature of the expression measurements. In\nface of these limitations, alternatives are needed to get better accuracy on\nthe GRNs inference problem. This work addresses this problem by presenting an\nalternative feature selection method that applies prior knowledge on its search\nstrategy, called SFFS-BA. The proposed search strategy is based on the\nSequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) algorithm, with the inclusion of a\nscale-free (Barab\\'asi-Albert) topology information in order to guide the\nsearch process to improve inference. The proposed algorithm explores the\nscale-free property by pruning the search space and using a power law as a\nweight for reducing it. In this way, the search space traversed by the SFFS-BA\nmethod combines a breadth-first search when the number of combinations is small\n(<k> <= 2) with a depth-first search when the number of combinations becomes\nexplosive (<k> >= 3), being guided by the scale-free prior information.\nExperimental results show that the SFFS-BA provides a better inference\nsimilarities than SFS and SFFS, keeping the robustness of the SFS and SFFS\nmethods, thus presenting very good results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 17:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}

The advent of leadership-class\ncomputers, as well as dedicated large-scale collaborative efforts such as the\nSciDAC 2 UNEDF project, have dramatically changed the field. This article gives\nan overview of the various computational challenges related to the nuclear DFT,\nas well as some of the recent achievements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 17:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}

Arguably, the SLDT and DRA strategies are the two\nmost successful extensions to standard linear tabled evaluation.

Depending on the symmetries of the Lagrangian, one can define two\nmodels. In one of them, the effective dimension flows from 2 in the ultraviolet\n(UV) and geometry constrains the infrared limit to be four-dimensional.

Satellites with a large baryon fraction experience adiabatic\ncontraction thus decreasing Rmax while leaving Vmax more or less unchanged.\nSubhaloes with smaller baryon fractions undergo a decrease in Vmax possibly due\nto outflows of material. Furthermore, the situation of finding subhaloes in\nsimulations that lie outside the confidence interval for possible hosts of the\nbright MW dwarf spheroidals, appears to be far more prominent in cosmologies\nwith a high sigma8 normalisation and depends on the mass of the host.

We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the\nSDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into\nthose that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as\nsatellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star\nformation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of\ngalaxies, f_q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes,\nthere is a positive, monotonic relationship between f_q and rho. We use the\ngroup catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central\nand satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more\nlikely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f_q-rho correlation\nis primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment,\nwhich causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass\ncentral galaxies (Mgal <~ 10^10.0 Msol/h^2), there is no correlation between\nf_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of\ndark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all\ncorrelates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution\nN-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central\ngalaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low\nmass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the\nstar formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation\nhistories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in\nold halos.

Such theories\ncannot be tested until we have a handle on ordinary environmental decoherence\nprocesses.

Experimental understanding of decoherence in molecular\nmagnets has been limited by short decoherence times, which make coherent spin\nmanipulation extremely difficult [6-9]. Here we reduce the decoherence by\napplying a strong magnetic field. The theory predicts the contributions to the\ndecoherence from phonons, nuclear spins, and intermolecular dipolar\ninteractions, for a single crystal of the Fe8 molecular magnet. In experiments\nwe find that the decoherence time varies strongly as a function of temperature\nand magnetic field. The theoretical predictions are fully verified\nexperimentally - there are no other visible decoherence sources.

I conclude by considering some of the most\npressing and open questions regarding the physics of high-redshift galaxies,\nwhich are to be addressed with future facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 20:09:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2011 16:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Then, we refine the vertical structure of the model using\nwide range of excitation conditions sampled by the CO lines, in particular the\nrarely observed J=6--5 transition. By fitting 13CO data in this structure, we\nfurther constrain the vertical distribution of CO to lie between a lower\nboundary below which CO freezes out onto dust grains (T ~ 19 K) and an upper\nboundary above which CO can be photodissociated (the hydrogen column density\nfrom the disk surface is ~ 10^{21} cm-2). The freeze-out at 19 K leads to a\nsignificant drop in the gas-phase CO column density beyond a radius of ~155 AU,\na \"CO snow line\" that we directly resolve.

When quantum effects are\nconsidered, black holes lead to a number of thermodynamic paradoxes associated\nwith the Hawking temperature and assumption of black hole entropy, which are\nbriefly reviewed. It is argued that the largest quantum effects arise from the\nconformal scalar degrees of freedom generated by the trace anomaly of the\nstress-energy tensor in curved space. At event horizons these can have\nmacroscopically large backreaction effects on the geometry, potentially\nremoving the classical event horizon of black hole and cosmological spacetimes,\nreplacing them with a quantum phase boundary layer, where the effective value\nof the gravitational vacuum energy density can change. In the effective theory\nincluding the quantum effects of the anomaly, the cosmological term becomes a\ndynamical condensate, whose value depends upon boundary conditions at the\nhorizon. By taking a positive value in the interior of a fully collapsed star,\nthe effective cosmological term removes any singularity, replacing it with a\nsmooth dark energy de Sitter interior. The resulting gravitational vacuum\ncondensate star (or gravastar) configuration resolves all black hole paradoxes,\nand provides a testable alternative to black holes as the final quantum\nmechanical end state of complete gravitational collapse.

The M_wl-Y_sph scaling relations, measured at\nDelta=500, 1000, and 2500 rho_c, are consistent in slope and normalization with\nprevious results derived under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE).\nWe find an intrinsic scatter in M_wl at fixed Y_sph of 20%, larger than both\nprevious measurements of M_HSE-Y_sph scatter as well as the scatter in true\nmass at fixed Y_sph found in simulations. Moreover, the scatter in our\nlensing-based scaling relations is morphology dependent, with 30-40% larger\nM_wl for undisturbed compared to disturbed clusters at the same Y_sph at r_500.\nFurther examination suggests that the segregation may be explained by the\ninability of our spherical lens models to faithfully describe the\nthree-dimensional structure of the clusters, in particular, the structure along\nthe line-of-sight. We find that the ellipticity of the brightest cluster\ngalaxy, a proxy for halo orientation, correlates well with the offset in mass\nfrom the mean scaling relation, which supports this picture. This provides\nempirical evidence that line-of-sight projection effects are an important\nsystematic uncertainty in lensing-based scaling relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 04:24:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 19:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

NLS1s as a class show a\nnumber of extreme properties and radio-loud ones are very rare. We build on\nthese radio results to understand that the central engines of radio-loud NLS1s\nare essentially the same as that of other radio-loud AGNs in terms of the\nformation of nonthermal jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 04:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

One attractive\napplication of supported membranes is the design of phantom cells exhibiting\nwell defined adhesive properties and receptor densities.

One\npotential mediator of the early stages of the aggregation process is the\nCasimir-type forces between adhesion sites induced by the membrane thermal\nfluctuations. In this review, I will present a theoretical analysis of\nfluctuation induced aggregation of adhesion sites in supported membranes. I\nwill first discuss the influence of a single attachment point on the spectrum\nof membrane thermal fluctuations, from which the free energy cost of the\nattachment point will be deduced. I will then analyze the problem of a\nsupported membrane with two adhesion points. Using scaling arguments and Monte\nCarlo simulations, I will demonstrate that two adhesion points attract each\nother via an infinitely long range effective potential that grows\nlogarithmically with the pair distance. Finally, I will discuss the many-body\nnature of the fluctuation induced interactions. I will show that while these\ninteractions alone are not sufficient to allow the formation of aggregation\nclusters, they greatly reduce the strength of the residual interactions\nrequired to facilitate cluster formation. Specifically, for adhesion molecules\ninteracting via a short range attractive potential, the strength of the direct\ninteractions required for aggregation is reduced by about a factor of two to\nbelow the thermal energy $k_BT$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 06:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-04"}

Line and\ncontinuum radio observations provide an optimal tool to access the (often)\noptically obscured innermost regions of AGN and reveal the kinematics of the\ngas around their central engines. We investigate the interplay between the\npeculiar NLS1 class of AGN and the maser phenomenon, to help us understand the\nnature of the maser emission in some NLS1s where water maser emission has been\ndetected. We observed a sample of NLS1 galaxies with the Green Bank Telescope\nin a search for water maser emission at 22 GHz. We also reduced and analysed\narchival Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array data and produced 22-GHz\nspectra for the five NLS1 galaxies with detected maser emission. In particular,\nwe imaged the maser and nuclear radio continuum of NGC5506 at subarcsec scales\nwith the Very Large Array. We discovered maser emission in two NLS1 galaxies:\nIGRJ16385-2057, and IRAS03450+0055. In addition to the three previously known\nmaser detections in the NLS1s Mrk766, NGC4051, and NGC5506, this yields a water\nmaser detection rate in NLS1 galaxies of ~7% (5/71). This value rises\nsignificantly to ~21% (5/24) when considering only NLS1 galaxies at recessional\nvelocities less than 10000 km/s. For NGC4051 and NGC5506, we find that the\nwater maser emission is located within 5 and 12 pc, respectively, of nuclear\nradio continuum knots, which are interpreted as core-jet structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 10:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

It is believed that both the solid surface and\nthe magnetic field of an NS can affect the accretion flow and show some\nobservable effects. Using the disk emission dominant data, we compare the disk\nevolution of the two types of systems from low luminosity to super-Eddington\nluminosity. As the luminosity decreases the disk in the NS LMXB 4U1608--522\nbegins to leave the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) at much higher\nluminosity ($\\sim$ 0.1 $L_{\\mathrm{Edd}}$), compared with BH LMXBs at much\nlower luminosity ($\\sim$ 0.03 $L_{\\mathrm{Edd}}$), due to the interaction\nbetween the NS magnetosphere and accretion flow. However, as the luminosity\nincreases above a critical luminosity, the disks in BH and NS LMXBs trace the\nsame evolutionary pattern, because the magnetosphere is restricted inside ISCO,\nand then both the NS surface emission and (dipole) magnetic field do not\nsignificantly affect the secular evolution of the accretion disk, that is\ndriven by the increased radiation pressure in the inner region. We further\nsuggest that the NS surface emission provides additional information of\naccretion disk, not available in BH systems. Through the observed NS surface\nemission, we argue that the disk thickness $H/R$ is less than $0.3-0.4$, and\nthat the significant outflow from inner disk edge exists at luminosity close to\nEddington luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 11:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The goal of this paper is to confront this new model to\nastronomical observations of different Galactic environments in the FIR/submm,\nin order to derive a set of canonical model parameters to be used as a Galactic\nreference to be compared to in future Galactic and extragalactic studies. We\nconfront the TLS model with existing astronomical data. We consider the average\nemission spectrum at high latitudes in our Galaxy as measured with FIRAS and\nWMAP, as well as the emission from Galactic compact sources observed with\nArcheops, for which an inverse relationship between the dust temperature and\nthe emissivity spectral index has been evidenced. We show that, unlike models\npreviously proposed which often invoke two dust components at different\ntemperatures, the TLS model successfully reproduces both the shape of the\nGalactic SED and its evolution with temperature as observed in the Archeops\ndata. The best TLS model parameters indicate a charge coherence length of\n\\simeq 13 nm and other model parameters in broad agreement with expectations\nfrom laboratory studies of dust analogs. We conclude that the millimeter excess\nemission, which is often attributed to the presence of very cold dust in the\ndiffuse ISM, is likely caused solely by TLS emission in disordered amorphous\ndust grains.

Interstellar dust grains, because of their catalytic properties, are\ncrucial to the formation of H2, the most abundant molecule in the Universe. The\nformation of molecular hydrogen strongly depends on the ability of H atoms to\nstick on dust grains. In this study we determine the sticking coefficient of H\natoms chemisorbed on graphitic surfaces, and estimate its impact on the forma-\ntion of H2. Methods. The sticking probability of H atoms chemisorbed onto\ngraphitic surfaces is obtained using a mixed classical-quantum dynamics method.\nIn this, the H atom is treated quantum- mechanically and the vibrational modes\nof the surface are treated classically. The implications of sticking for the\nformation of H2 are addressed by using Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that\nfollow how atoms stick, move and associate with each other on dust surfaces of\ndifferent temper- ature. Results. In our model, molecular hydrogen forms very\nefficiently for dust temperatures lower than 15 K through the involvement of\nphysisorbed H atoms. At dust temperatures higher than 15 K and gas temperatures\nlower than 2000 K, H2 formation differs strongly if the H atoms com- ing from\nthe gas phase have to cross a square barrier (usually considered in previous\nstudies) or a barrier obtained by DFT calculations to become chemisorbed. The\nproduct of sticking times efficiency can be increased by many orders of\nmagnitude when realistic barriers are considered. If graphite phonons are taken\ninto account in the dynamics calculations, then H atoms stick better on the\nsurface at high energies, but the overall H2 formation efficiency is only\nslightly affected. Our results suggest that H2 formation can proceed\nefficiently in photon dominated regions, X-ray dominated regions, hot cores and\nin the early Universe when the first dust is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 12:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We hope to explain such questions as what\nprocess can keep the disk atmospheres dusty for the lifetime of the disk and\nhow does the particle properties change as a function of height above the\nmidplane. We use a Monte Carlo code to follow the mass and porosity evolution\nof the particles in time. The used collision model is based on laboratory\nexperiments performed on dust aggregates. As the experiments cannot cover all\npossible collision scenarios, the largest uncertainty of our model is the\nnecessary extrapolations we had to perform. We simultaneously solve for the\nparticle growth and motion. Particles can move vertically due to settling and\nturbulent mixing. We assume that the vertical profile of the gas density is\nfixed in time and only the solid component evolves. We find that the used\ncollision model strongly influences the masses and sizes of the particles. The\nlaboratory experiment based collision model greatly reduces the particle sizes\ncompared to models that assume sticking at all collision velocities. We find\nthat a turbulence parameter of alpha = 10^-2 is needed to keep the dust\natmospheres dusty, but such strong turbulence can produce only small particles\nat the midplane which is not favorable for planetesimal formation models. We\nalso see that the particles are larger at the midplane and smaller at the upper\nlayers of the disk. At 3-4 pressure scale heights micron-sized particles are\nproduced. These particle sizes are needed to explain the 10 micron feature of\ndisk SEDs. Turbulence may therefore help to keep small dust particles in the\ndisk atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 12:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)\nmicroparticles (2.86 {\\pm} 0.95 {\\mu}m) were conjugated with wheat germ\nagglutinin (WGA-MP, cytoadhesive protein) or bovine serum albumin (BSA-MP,\nnonspecific protein) and their binding to epithelial cell monolayers was\ninvestigated under stationary and flow conditions.

However, while binding of BSA-MP was totally inhibited by flow,\ngrafting with WGA resulted in a pronounced anchoring effect. This was indicated\nby a mean number of 747 {\\pm} 241 mm-2 and 104 {\\pm} 44 mm-2 attached particles\nat shear rates of 0.2 s-1 and 1 s-1 respectively. Due to the compactness of the\nfluidic chip which favours parallelization, this setup represents a highly\npromising approach towards a screening platform for the performance of drug\ndelivery vehicles under physiological flow conditions. In this regard, the\nflow-chip is expected to provide substantial information for the successful\ndesign and development of targeted micro- and nanoparticulate drug carrier\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 13:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-27"}

The noise\nlevels attained by Kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50% the target levels for\nsolar-type, quiet stars.

The Voronoi method is used\nto resolve the fine structure of the resulting velocity-density relations and\nspatial dependence of the measurements. The data show that the specific flow\nconcept is applicable also for bidirectional streams. For various forms of\nordering in bidirectional streams, no large differences among density-flow\nrelationships are found in the observed density range. The fundamental diagrams\nof bidirectional streams with different forms of ordering are compared with\nthat of unidirectional streams. The result shows differences in the shape of\nthe relation for {\\rho} > 1.0 m-2. The maximum of the specific flow in\nunidirectional streams is significantly larger than that in all bidirectional\nstreams examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 15:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 14:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

Their movements are governed by\nHelmholtz' elementary vortex rules applied locally. A contact interaction or\n'collision' leads either to random scatter of a trajectory or to the formation\nof two likewise rotating, fundamentally unstable whirls forming a dissipative\npatch slowly rotating around its center of mass which is almost at rest. This\napproach predicts von Karman's constant as 1/sqrt(2 pi) = 0.399 and the\nspatio-temporal dynamics of energy-containing time and length scales\ncontrolling turbulent mixing [Baumert 2009]. A link to turbulence spectra was\nmissing so far. In the present paper it is shown that the above image of random\nvortex-dipole movements is compatible with Kolmogorov's turbulence spectra if\ndissipative patches, beginning as two likewise rotating eddies, evolve locally\ninto a space-filling bearing in the sense of Herrmann [1990], i.e. into an\n\"Apollonian gear\". Its parts and pieces are incompressible and flexibly\ndeformable vortex tubes which are frictionless, excepting the dissipative scale\nof size zero. For steady and locally homogeneous conditions our approach\npredicts the dimensionless pre-factor in the 3D Eulerian wavenumber spectrum as\n[(4 pi)^2/3]/3 = 1.8, and in the Lagrangian frequency spectrum as 2. Our\nderivations rest on geometry, methods from many-particle physics, and on\nelementary conservation laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 23:02:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 13:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-29"}
