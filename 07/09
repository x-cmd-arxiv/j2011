If the period of the TTVs, P_TTV, is longer\nthan the time baseline of the observations and its amplitude, A_TTV, is larger\nthan the timing precision limit of the data, transiting planet candidates are\nstill detected, but with incorrect ephemerides. Therefore, they will be\ndiscarded during follow-up. When P_TTV is shorter than the time baseline of the\nobservations and A_TTV is sufficiently large, constant period search algorithms\nfind an average period for the system, which results in altered transit\ndurations and depths in the folded light curves. Those candidates can get\nsubsequently discarded as eclipsing binaries, grazing eclipses, or blends.\nAlso, for large enough A_TTVs, the transits can get fully occulted by the\nphotometric dispersion of the light curves. These detection biases could\nexplain the observed statistical differences between the frequency of multiple\nsystems among planets detected via other techniques and those detected via\ntransits. We suggest that new transit search algorithms allowing for\nnon-constant period planets should be implemented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 16:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Due to detection of\ntheir thermal emission in X-rays they are important to study NS cooling and to\nprobe theoretical cooling models. Hence, a precise determination of their age\nis essential. Recently, new parallax measurements of RXJ1856 and RXJ0720 were\nobtained. Considering that NSs may originate from binary systems that got\ndisrupted due to an asymmetric supernova, we attempt to identify runaway stars\nwhich may have been former companions to the NS progenitors. Such an\nidentification would strongly support a particular birth scenario with time and\nplace. We trace back each NS, runaway star and the centres of possible birth\nassociations to find close encounters. The kinematic age is then given by the\ntime since the encounter. We use Monte Carlo simulations to account for\nobservational uncertainties. Using the most recent parallax measurement of\n8.16+/-0.80 mas for RXJ1856, we find that it originated in the U Sco\nassociation 0.46+/-0.05 Myr ago. This is slightly larger than the value we\nreported earlier (0.3 Myr). Our result is strongly supported by its current\nradial velocity that we predict to be 6+19-20 km/s. This implies an inclination\nangle of 88+/-6 deg consistent with the bow shock. No suitable runaway star was\nfound to be a potential former companion of RXJ1856. Making use of a recent\nparallax measurement for RXJ0720 of 3.6+/-1.6 mas, we find that this NS was\npossibly born in Tr 10 0.85+/-0.15 Myr ago. This is somewhat larger than the\none obtained using the old parallax value (0.5 Myr). We suggest the B0 runaway\nsupergiant HIP 43158 as a candidate for a former companion. Then, the current\ndistance of RXJ0720 to the Sun should be 286+27-23 pc, in agreement with recent\nmeasurements. We then expect the radial velocity of RXJ0720 to be -76+34-17\nkm/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 16:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

(Each pulsar emits pulses at a fixed\nrepetition period in its rest frame.) The positioning system uses the fact that\nan event in spacetime can be fully described by emission coordinates: the\nproper emission time of each pulse measured at the event. The proper emission\ntime of each pulse from four different pulsars---interpolated as\nnecessary---provides the four spacetime coordinates of the reception event in\nthe emission coordinate system. If more than four pulsars are available, the\nredundancy can improve the accuracy of the determination and/or resolve\ndegeneracies resulting from special geometrical arrangements of the sources and\nthe event.\n  We introduce a robust numerical approach to measure the emission coordinates\nof an event in any arbitrary spacetime geometry. Our approach uses a continuous\nsolution of the eikonal equation describing the backward null cone from the\nevent. The pulsar proper time at the instant the null cone intersects the\npulsar world line is one of the four required coordinates. The process is\ncomplete (modulo degeneracies) when four pulsar world lines have been crossed\nby the light cone.\n  The numerical method is applied in two different examples: measuring emission\ncoordinates of an event in Minkowski spacetime using pulses from four pulsars\nstationary in the spacetime; and measuring emission coordinates of an event in\nSchwarzschild spacetime using pulses from four pulsars freely falling toward a\nstatic black hole.\n  These numerical simulations are merely exploratory, but with improved\nresolution and computational resources the method can be applied to more\npertinent problems. For instance one could measure the emission coordinates,\nand therefore the trajectory, of the Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 18:03:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 04:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2011 12:34:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 14:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-09"}

In recent years, due to many of its\nmodern applications, there has been significant interest to address the\ndistinct counting problem in a data stream setting, where each incoming data\ncan be seen only once and cannot be stored for long periods of time. Many\nprobabilistic approaches based on either sampling or sketching have been\nproposed in the computer science literature, that only require limited\ncomputing and memory resources. However, the performances of these methods are\nnot scale-invariant, in the sense that their relative root mean square\nestimation errors (RRMSE) depend on the unknown cardinalities. This is not\ndesirable in many applications where cardinalities can be very dynamic or\ninhomogeneous and many cardinalities need to be estimated. In this paper, we\ndevelop a novel approach, called self-learning bitmap (S-bitmap) that is\nscale-invariant for cardinalities in a specified range. S-bitmap uses a binary\nvector whose entries are updated from 0 to 1 by an adaptive sampling process\nfor inferring the unknown cardinality, where the sampling rates are reduced\nsequentially as more and more entries change from 0 to 1. We prove rigorously\nthat the S-bitmap estimate is not only unbiased but scale-invariant. We\ndemonstrate that to achieve a small RRMSE value of $\\epsilon$ or less, our\napproach requires significantly less memory and consumes similar or less\noperations than state-of-the-art methods for many common practice cardinality\nscales.

As in ordinary photon-regeneration (light shining through a\nwall) experiments, a laser beam traverses a region permeated by a magnetic\nfield, where photons are converted to ALPs via the Primakoff process, resulting\nin a slight power loss and phase shift. The beam is then combined with a\nreference beam that originates from the same source. The detection of a change\nin the output intensity would signal the presence of ALPs (or possibly other\nparticles that couple to the photon in a similar way).

The R-symmetry (and\nits small breaking) implies that the gauginos (and the neutralino LSP) are\npseudo-Dirac fermions, which is relevant for both baryogenesis and DM. The\nsinglet superpartner of the U(1)_Y pseudo-Dirac gaugino plays a prominent role\nin making the electroweak phase transition strongly first-order. The\npseudo-Dirac nature of the LSP allows it to behave similarly to a Dirac\nparticle during freeze-out, but like a Majorana particle for annihilation today\nand in scattering against nuclei, thus being consistent with current\nconstraints. Assuming a standard cosmology, it is possible to simultaneously\nhave a strongly first-order phase transition conducive to baryogenesis and have\nthe LSP provide the full DM relic abundance, in part of the allowed parameter\nspace. However, other possibilities for DM also exist, which are discussed. It\nis expected that upcoming direct DM searches as well as neutrino signals from\nDM annihilation in the Sun will be sensitive to this class of models.\nInteresting collider and Gravity-wave signals are also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We find that flare\ncandidates appear in different types of SGRB host galaxy environments and show\nno clear correlation with the X-ray afterglow lifetime; flare candidates are\ndetected both in SGRBs with a bright extended emission in the soft gamma-rays\nand in SGRBs which do not show such component. We furthermore show that SGRB\nX-ray flare candidates only partially share the set of observational properties\nof long GRB (LGRB) flares. In particular,the main parameter driving the\nduration evolution of X-ray variability episodes in both classes is found to be\nthe elapsed time from the explosion, with very limited dependence on the\ndifferent progenitors, environments, central engine life-times, prompt\nvariability time-scales and energy budgets. On the contrary, SGRB flare\ncandidates significantly differ from LGRB flares in terms of peak luminosity,\nisotropic energy, flare-to-prompt luminosity ratio and relative variability\nflux. However, these differences disappear when the central engine time-scales\nand energy budget are accounted for, suggesting that (i) flare candidates and\nprompt pulses in SGRBs likely have a common origin; (ii) similar dissipation\nand/or emission mechanisms are responsible for the prompt and flare emission in\nlong and short GRBs, with SGRBs being less energetic albeit faster evolving\nversions of the long class. Finally, we show that in strict analogy to the SGRB\nprompt emission, flares candidates fall off the lag-luminosity relation defined\nby LGRBs, thus strengthening the SGRB flare-prompt pulse connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 21:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The time-dependent description of grain growth in our detailed\nradiation-hydrodynamical models gives information about dust particle radii in\nevery layer at every instant of time. These grain radii are used for computing\nopacities and determining the radiative acceleration of the dust-gas mixture.\nIt is shown that in the critical cases the effect of the generalized\ndescription of dust opacities can be significant, resulting in more intense\nmass loss and higher wind velocities compared to models using SPL opacities.\nFor well-developed winds, however, grain size effects on mass loss rates and\nwind velocities are found to be small. Both groups of models tend towards lower\ndegrees of dust condensation compared to corresponding SPL models, due to a\nself-regulating feedback between grain growth and radiative acceleration.\nConsequently, the \"dust-loss rates\" are lower in the models with the\ngeneralized treatment of grain opacities.

We use ACS images from the Hubble Space Telescope in F435W and F814W\nbands. The galaxies in the sample represent different interaction phases and\ncover a wide luminosity range (11.46 \\leq log (L_IR (Lsun)) \\leq 12.54). With a\nmedian size of 32 pc, most of the nearly 3000 knots detected consists of\ncomplexes of star clusters. Some of the knots (~15%) are so blue that their\ncolors indicate a young (i.e., < 30 Myr) and almost extinction-free population.\nThere is a clear correlation of the mass of these blue knots with their radius,\nM \\propto R^{1.91\\pm0.14}, similar to that found in complexes of clusters in\nM51 and in Giant Molecular Clouds. This suggests that the star formation within\nthe knots is proportional to the gas density at any given radius. The star\nformation of all the knots is characterized by luminosity functions (LFs) of\nthe knots with slopes close to 2. Though, we see a marginally significant\nindication that the LF evolves with the interaction process, becoming steeper\nfrom early to advanced merger phases. Due to size-of-sample effects we are\nprobably sampling knots in ULIRGs intrinsically more luminous (x4) than in less\nluminous systems. They also have sizes and are likely to have masses\ncharacteristic of clumps in galaxies at z \\gtrsim 1. Knots in post-mergers are\non average larger (x 1.3-2), more luminous (2 mag) in the I-band, and 0.5 mag\nredder than those in systems in earlier phases.

This work\nclarifies some aspects of the theory of dependence structure of Markov chains\ngenerated by copulas that are useful in time series econometrics and other\napplied fields. The main aim of this paper is to clarify the relationship\nbetween the notions of geometric ergodicity and geometric {\\rho}-mixing;\nnamely, to point out that for a large number of well known copulas, such as\nClayton, Gumbel or Student, these notions are equivalent. Some of the results\npublished in the last years appear to be redundant if one takes into account\nthis fact. We apply this equivalence to show that any mixture of Clayton,\nGumbel or Student copulas generate both geometrically ergodic and geometric\n{\\rho}-mixing stationary Markov chains, answering in this way an open question\nin the literature. We shall also point out that a sufficient condition for\n{\\rho}-mixing, used in the literature, actually implies Doeblin recurrence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2011 15:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 23:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-04"}

GVT is\na generally covariant theory of gravity composed of a pseudo Riemannian metric\nand two U(1) gauge connections that reproduces MOND in the limit of very weak\ngravitational fields while remains consistent with the Einstein-Hilbert gravity\nin the limit of strong and Newtonian gravitational fields. GVT also provides a\nsimple framework to study the GEM approximation to gravity. We illustrate that\nthe gravitomagnetic force at the edge of a galaxy can be in accord with either\nGVT or \\Lambda CDM but not both. We also study the physics of the GVT theory\naround the gravitational saddle point of the Sun and Jupiter system. We notice\nthat the conclusive refusal of the GVT theory demands measuring either both of\nthe gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields inside the Sun-Jupiter MOND\nwindow, or the gravitoelectric field inside two different solar GVT MOND\nwindows. The GVT theory, however, will be favored by observing an anomaly in\nthe gravitoelectric field inside a single MOND window.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2011 09:18:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 09:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 14:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 17:44:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 13:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 16:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}
