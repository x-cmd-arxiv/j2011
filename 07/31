Assuming that BHs are created in the\nearly stages of galaxy formation, they grow by mergers and accretion of gas at\na Eddington-limited Bondi accretion rate. However this growth is regulated by\nAGN feedback which we model using two different modes: a quasar-heating mode\nwhen accretion rates onto the BHs are comparable to the Eddington rate, and a\nradio-jet mode at lower accretion rates. In other words, our feedback model\ndeposits energy as a succession of thermal bursts and jet outflows depending on\nthe properties of the gas surrounding the BHs. We assess the plausibility of\nsuch a model by comparing our results to observational measurements of the\ncoevolution of BHs and their host galaxy properties, and check their robustness\nwith respect to numerical resolution. We show that AGN feedback must be a\ncrucial physical ingredient for the formation of massive galaxies as it appears\nto be the only physical mechanism able to efficiently prevent the accumulation\nof and/or expel cold gas out of halos/galaxies and significantly suppress star\nformation. Our model predicts that the relationship between BHs and their host\ngalaxy mass evolves as a function of redshift, because of the vigorous\naccretion of cold material in the early Universe that drives Eddington-limited\naccretion onto BHs. Quasar activity is also enhanced at high redshift. However,\nas structures grow in mass and lose their cold material through star formation\nand efficient BH feedback ejection, the AGN activity in the low-redshift\nUniverse becomes more and more dominated by the radio mode, which powers jets\nthrough the hot circum-galactic medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2011 21:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 10:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

They have been interpreted in terms of thin-target, nonthermal\nbremsstrahlung emission. This interpretation has led to rather extreme physical\nrequirements in some cases. For example, in one case, essentially all of the\nelectrons in the source must be accelerated to nonthermal energies to account\nfor the coronal HXR source. In other cases, the extremely hard photon spectra\nof the coronal continuum gamma-ray emission suggest that the low energy cutoff\nof the electron energy distribution lies in the MeV energy range. Here we\nconsider the role of inverse Compton scattering (ICS) as an alternate emission\nmechanism in both the ultra- and mildly relativistic regimes. It is known that\nrelativistic electrons are produced during powerful flares; these are capable\nof up-scattering soft photospheric photons to HXR and gamma-ray energies.\nPreviously overlooked is the fact that mildly relativistic electrons, generally\nproduced in much greater numbers in flares of all sizes, can up-scatter EUV/SXR\nphotons to HXR energies. We also explore ICS on anisotropic electron\ndistributions and show that the resulting emission can be significantly\nenhanced over an isotropic electron distribution for favorable viewing\ngeometries. We briefly review results from bremsstrahlung emission and\nreconsider circumstances under which nonthermal bremsstrahlung or ICS would be\nfavored. Finally, we consider a selection of coronal HXR and gamma-ray events\nand find that in some cases the ICS is a viable alternative emission mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2011 04:04:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2012 22:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The abundance inhomogeneities of light elements observed in Globular\nClusters (GCs), and notably the ubiquitous Na-O anti-correlation, are generally\ninterpreted as evidence that GCs comprise several generations of stars. There\nis an on-going debate as to the nature of the stars which produce the\ninhomogeneous elements, and investigating the behavior of several elements is a\nway to shed new light on this problem. Aims. We aim at investigating the Li and\nNa content of the GC M 4, that is known to have a well defined Na-O\nanti-correlation. Methods. We obtained moderate resolution (R=17 000-18 700)\nspectra for 91 main sequence (MS)/sub-giant branch stars of M 4 with the\nGiraffe spectrograph at the FLAMES/VLT ESO facility. Using model atmospheres\nanalysis we measured lithium and sodium abundances. Results. We detect a weak\nLi-Na anti-correlation among un-evolved MS stars. One star in the sample, #\n37934, shows the remarkably high lithium abundance A(Li)=2.87, compatible with\ncurrent estimates of the primordial lithium abundance. Conclusions. The shallow\nslope found for the Li-Na anti-correlation suggests that lithium is produced in\nparallel to sodium. This evidence, coupled with its sodium-rich nature,\nsuggests that the high lithium abundance of star # 37934 may originate by\npollution from a previous generations of stars. The recent detection of a\nLi-rich dwarf of pollution origin in the globular cluster NGC 6397 may also\npoint in this direction. Still, no clear cut evidence is available against a\npossible preservation of the primordial lithium abundance for star # 37934.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2011 05:29:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 16:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 21:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

It\nis found that the break of the electron spectrum ($\\gamma_{\\rm b}$) is\ndifferent among sources, but magnetic field strength distributes narrowly in\n$0.1-0.6 $ G, indicating that the shocks in the jets are significantly\ndifferent among sources and the magnetic field may be independent of the\nshocks. The ratio of $F_{1 TeV}$ is correlated with the ratio of the\n$\\gamma_{\\rm b}$ in the low and high states, indicating that the relativistic\nshocks in the jets may be responsible for the observed flux variations and the\nspectral shift. The ratio of the two peak luminosities $L_{\\rm c}/L_{\\rm s}$ is\nanti-correlated with $\\nu_{\\rm s}$ in the co-moving frame, which is possibly\ndue to the Klein-Nishina effect. No excess in the GeV band due to the\ninteraction between the TeV photons and the extragalactic background light is\nobserved, implying that the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field would\nbe much larger than $ 10^{-16}$ G.

IceCube was completed in December 2010\nforming a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ~ 1\ncubic kilometer in the deep Antarctic ice for particle induced photons. The\ntelescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 GeV.\nOwing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates are\nparticularly low. Hence IceCube can also detect large numbers of MeV neutrinos\nby observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the dark\nnoise. With 2 ms timing resolution, IceCube can detect subtle features in the\ntemporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. For a supernova at the\ngalactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-free\nmegaton-scale supernova search experiment. The sensitivity decreases to 20\nstandard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations at\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (50 kpc). IceCube is sending triggers from potential\nsupernovae to the Supernova Early Warning System. The sensitivity to neutrino\nproperties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed, as well as the\npossibility to detect the neutronization burst, a short outbreak of electron\nneutrinos released by electron capture on protons soon after collapse.\nTantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black hole\nas well as the characteristics of shock waves, are investigated to illustrate\nIceCube's capability for supernova detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2011 12:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 18:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

The two pulsars and their pulsar wind nebulae\n(PWNe) are also detected in X-rays by Chandra and XMM. No deep optical\nobservations of these two pulsars have been reported so far. We used multi-band\noptical images (V,R,I) taken with the VLT and available in the European\nSouthern Observatory (ESO) archive to search for, or put tight constraints to,\ntheir optical emission. We re-assessed the positions of the two pulsars from\nthe analyses of all the available Chandra observations and the comparison with\nthe published radio coordinates. For PSR J1357-6429, this yielded a tentative\nproper motion mu=0.17+/-0.055 \"/yr (70+/-15 deg position angle). We did not\ndetect candidate counterparts to PSR J1357-6429 and PSR J1048-5832 down to V~27\nand ~27.6, respectively, although for the former we found a possible evidence\nfor a faint, unresolved object at the Chandra position. Our limits imply an\nefficiency in converting spin-down power into optical luminosity <7x10^{-7} and\n<6x10^{-6}, respectively, possibly close to that of the Vela pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2011 14:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The proposed method generalizes and improves the procedure derived\nby Deng et al., Phys. Rev. B. 79 075114 (2009), overcoming the restriction to\ndensity-density interaction without increasing the complexity of the\ncomputational algorithm. Our approach drastically reduces the problem of the\nhigh-dimensional Gutzwiller minimization by mapping it to a minimization only\nin the variational density matrix, in the spirit of the Levy and Lieb\nformulation of DFT. For fixed density the Gutzwiller renormalization matrix is\ndetermined as a fixpoint of a proper functional, whose evaluation only requires\nground-state calculations of matrices defined in the Gutzwiller variational\nspace. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to account for the symmetries\nof the variational function in a controlled way, reducing the number of\nvariational parameters. After a detailed description of the method we present\ncalculations for multi-band Hubbard models with full (rotationally invariant)\nHund's rule on-site interaction. Our analysis shows that the numerical\nalgorithm is very efficient, stable and easy to implement. For these reasons\nthis method is particularly suitable for first principle studies -- e.g., in\ncombination with DFT -- of many complex real materials, where the full\nintra-atomic interaction is important to obtain correct results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2011 14:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2011 20:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The first step, named active orthogonization,\northogonalizes an arbi- trary regression matrix by elaborately adding more\nrows. The second step imputes the responses of the new rows. The third step\nsolves the least squares problem of interest for the complete orthog- onal\ndesign. The second and third steps have simple closed forms, and iterate until\nconvergence. The algorithm works for ordinary least squares and regularized\nleast squares with the lasso, SCAD, MCP and other penalties. It has several\nattractive theoretical properties. For the ordinary least squares with a\nsingular regression matrix, an OEM sequence converges to the Moore-Penrose gen-\neralized inverse-based least squares estimator. For the SCAD and MCP, an OEM\nsequence can achieve the oracle property after sufficient iterations for a\nfixed or diverging number of variables. For ordinary and regularized least\nsquares with various penalties, an OEM sequence converges to a point having\ngrouping coherence for fully aliased regression matrices. Convergence and\nconvergence rate of the algorithm are examined. These convergence rate results\nshow that for the same data set, OEM converges faster for regularized least\nsquares than ordinary least squares. This provides a new theoretical comparison\nbetween these methods.

However, storing and analyzing search logs can be very useful for\nmany purposes (i.e. investigating human behavior). Thus, an important research\nquestion is how to privately sanitize search logs. Several search log\nanonymization techniques have been proposed with concrete privacy models.\nHowever, in all of these solutions, the output utility of the techniques is\nonly evaluated rather than being maximized in any fashion. Indeed, for\neffective search log anonymization, it is desirable to derive the optimal\n(maximum utility) output while meeting the privacy standard. In this paper, we\npropose utility-maximizing sanitization based on the rigorous privacy standard\nof differential privacy, in the context of search logs. Specifically, we\nutilize optimization models to maximize the output utility of the sanitization\nfor different applications, while ensuring that the production process\nsatisfies differential privacy. An added benefit is that our novel\nrandomization strategy ensures that the schema of the output is identical to\nthat of the input. A comprehensive evaluation on real search logs validates the\napproach and demonstrates its robustness and scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2011 15:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 22:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 01:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
