One of the basic\nissues is how to answer queries that are posed against target data. While\nconsensus has been reached on the definitive semantics for monotonic queries,\nthis issue turned out to be considerably more difficult for non-monotonic\nqueries. Several semantics for non-monotonic queries have been proposed in the\npast few years. This article proposes a new semantics for non-monotonic\nqueries, called the GCWA*-semantics. It is inspired by semantics from the area\nof deductive databases. We show that the GCWA*-semantics coincides with the\nstandard open world semantics on monotonic queries, and we further explore the\n(data) complexity of evaluating non-monotonic queries under the\nGCWA*-semantics. In particular, we introduce a class of schema mappings for\nwhich universal queries can be evaluated under the GCWA*-semantics in\npolynomial time (data complexity) on the core of the universal solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 17:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 09:14:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 07:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Moreover, these results suggest the\nexistence of a balance between cargo hopping and the movement of the complex\nthat may control the efficiency of cargo transfer and cargo delivering.\nConsiderations about the energy involved in the transport process show that the\nmodel presented here offers a considerable advantage over other models in the\nliterature for which cargo movement is restricted to the movement of\ncargo-motor complexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 20:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2011 20:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 15:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-27"}

We detect a ~1 mJy source at 1.43, 4.86, 8.46 and 22.5 GHz,\nmaking it the most luminous radio emission over the widest frequency range\ndetected from an ultracool dwarf to date. A 10 hr VLA observation reveals that\nthe radio emission varies sinusoidally with a period of 3.89+/-0.05 hr, and an\namplitude of ~30% at 4.86 GHz and ~20% at 8.46 GHz. The periodicity is also\nseen in circular polarization, where at 4.86 GHz the polarization reverses\nhelicity from left- to right-handed in phase with the total intensity. An\narchival detection in the FIRST survey indicates that the radio emission has\nbeen stable for at least a decade. We also detect periodic photometric\nvariability in several optical filters with a period of 3.79 hr, and measure a\nrotation velocity of vsini=45+/-5 km/s, in good agreement with the radio and\noptical periods. The period and rotation velocity allow us to place a lower\nlimit on the radius of the source of >0.12 R_sun, about 30% larger than\ntheoretical expectations. The properties of the radio emission can be explained\nwith a simple model of a magnetic dipole mis-aligned relative to the stellar\nrotation axis, with the sinusoidal variations and helicity reversal due to the\nrotation of the magnetic poles relative to our line of sight. The long-term\nstability of the radio emission indicates that the magnetic field (and hence\nthe dynamo) is stable on a much longer timescale than the convective turn-over\ntime of ~0.2 yr. If the radio emission is due to the electron cyclotron maser\nprocess, the inferred magnetic field strength reaches at least 8 kG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 20:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In\nthese approaches, the normally inactive nodes in the relay network can be used\nas cooperative jamming sources to confuse the eavesdropper. Linear precoding\nschemes are investigated for two scenarios where single or multiple data\nstreams are transmitted via a decode-and-forward (DF) relay, under the\nassumption that global channel state information (CSI) is available. For the\ncase of single data stream transmission, we derive closed-form jamming\nbeamformers and the corresponding optimal power allocation.

Furthermore, the case involving an eavesdropper with unknown\nCSI is also investigated in this paper.

The variations usually look erratic, not periodic nor purely\nrandom. Many of these objects also show lognormal flux distribution and RMS -\nflux relation and power law frequency distribution. So far, the lognormal flux\ndistribution of black hole objects is only observational facts without\nsatisfactory explanation about the physical mechanism producing such\ndistribution in the accretion disk. One of the most promising models based on\ncellular automaton mechanism has been successful in reproducing PSD (Power\nSpectral Density) of the observed objects but could not reproduce lognormal\nflux distribution. Such distribution requires the existence of underlying\nmultiplicative process while the existing SOC models are based on additive\nprocesses. A modified SOC model based on cellular automaton mechanism for\nproducing lognormal flux distribution is presented in this paper. The idea is\nthat the energy released in the avalanche and diffusion in the accretion disk\nis not entirely emitted instantaneously as in the original cellular automaton\nmodel. Some part of the energy is kept in the disk and thus increase its energy\ncontent so that the next avalanche will be in higher energy condition and will\nrelease more energy. The later an avalanche occurs, the more amount of energy\nis emitted to the observers. This can provide multiplicative effects to the\nflux and produces lognormal flux distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 04:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We start this short review with the main observational facts that lead\nto the theoretical model of a thermonuclear runaway that takes place in an\naccreted hydrogen rich envelope placed on top of a cool degenerate core of a\nwhite dwarf. According to the theory, the accreted envelope becomes unstable to\nconvection days to weeks prior to the runaway. During the extreme stages of the\nrunaway itself, when the burning is most efficient, the envelope is fully\nconvective. Therefore, the elements processed under such extreme conditions are\nlifted to the outermost regions of the star. A significant fraction of the\nenvelope is ejected during the outburst. The complicated combination of\nhydrodynamic instabilities and explosive hydrogen burning, close to the surface\nof the star, gives us a unique opportunity to study this complex reactive flow.\nThe range of core masses, core temperatures and accretion rates introduce a\nwhole range of burning temperatures and densities. Following the description of\nthe \"standard\" cases, we then focus on rare, but still possible, portions of\nthe relevant parameter space, in which \"breakout\" of the traditional CNO cycle\ncan occur and lead to heavy element enrichment patterns caused only by breakout\nburning. We conclude our review with the main challenges that nova theorists\nface today, with special emphasis on problems related to the nucleosynthesis\nissues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 07:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

For this\nreason, random partition based evaluation of performance is no longer\nconvincing if we take the sampling method into account. Hence, in this paper,\naim at filling this void, we try to reevaluate the performance of local\ninformation based link predictions through sampling methods governed division\nof the training set and the probe set. It is interesting that we find for\ndifferent sampling methods, each prediction approach performs unevenly.\nMoreover, most of these predictions perform weakly when the sampling method is\nbiased, which indicates that the performance of these methods is overestimated\nin the prior works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 09:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

Without considering any explicit flavour\nsymmetry, there is an instructive exercise one can do: to determine the\nsimplest flavour structures which can account for the data with a minimum\nnumber of parameters, simply assuming these parameters to be uncorrelated. This\napproach points towards a limited number of simple structures which show the\nminimum complexity a neutrino mass model must generally involve to account for\nthe data. These basic structures essentially lead to only 4 relations between\nthe neutrino observables. We emphasize that 2 of these relations, |sin\ntheta_13|=(tan theta_23/cos delta)*(1-tan theta_12)/(1+tan theta_12) and |sin\ntheta_13| = sin theta_12 R^1/4, with R= Delta m^2_21/Delta m^2_32, have several\ndistinctive properties. First, they hold not only with a minimum number of\nparameters, but also for complete classes of more general models. Second, any\nvalue of theta_13 within the T2K and MINOS ranges can be obtained from these\nrelations by taking into account small perturbations. Third, they turn out to\nbe the pivot relations of models with approximate conservation of lepton\nnumber, which allow the seesaw interactions to induce observable flavour\nviolating processes, such as mu -> e gamma and tau -> mu gamma. Finally, in\nspecific cases of this kind, these structures have the rather unique property\nto allow a full reconstruction of the seesaw Lagrangian from low energy data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 09:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

All these effects have been observed with atoms or\nmolecules in the gas phase. Although predicted to occur, a strong light-phase\nsensitivity of electrons liberated by few-cycle laser pulses from solids has\nhitherto been elusive. Here we show a carrier-envelope (C-E) phase-dependent\ncurrent modulation of up to 100% recorded in spectra of electrons laser-emitted\nfrom a nanometric tungsten tip. Controlled by the C-E phase, electrons\noriginate from either one or two sub-500as long instances within the 6-fs laser\npulse, leading to the presence or absence of spectral interference. We also\nshow that coherent elastic re-scattering of liberated electrons takes place at\nthe metal surface.

After a detour via the field-theoretical\nrenormalization group approach of the latter model, we finally lay out the\nfoundations for a proper HRT of fluids in a disordered porous material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 11:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Such proofs of knowledge are called Zero Knowledge\nInteractive Proofs (ZKIP) and involve interactions between two communicating\nparties, the Prover and the Verifier. In a ZKIP, the Prover demonstrates the\npossesion of some information (e.g. authentication information) to the Verifier\nwithout disclosing it. In this paper, we focus on the application of ZKIP\nprotocols on resource constrained devices. We study well-established ZKIP\nprotocols based on the discrete logarithm problem and we transform them under\nthe ECC setting. Then, we implement the proposed protocols on Wiselib, a\ngeneric and open source algorithmic library. Finally, we present a thorough\nevaluation of the protocols on two popular hardware platforms equipped with low\nend microcontrollers (Jennic JN5139, TI MSP430) and 802.15.4 RF transceivers,\nin terms of code size, execution time, message size and energy requirements. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of implementing and\nevaluating ZKIP protocols with emphasis on low-end devices. This work's results\ncan be used from developers who wish to achieve certain levels of security and\nprivacy in their applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 13:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In particular, this model yields general closed-form equations of link\nthroughputs. However, an idealized and important assumption made in ICN is that\nthe backoff countdown process is in \"contiuous-time\" and carrier sensing is\ninstantaneous. As a result, there is no collision in ICN. In practical CSMA\nprotocols such as IEEE 802.11, the stations count down in \"mini-timeslot\" and\nthe process is therefore a \"discrete-time\" process. In particular, two stations\nmay end their backoff process in the same mini-timeslot and then transmit\nsimultaneously, resulting in a packet collision. This paper is an attempt to\nstudy how to compute link throughputs after taking such backoff collision\neffects into account. We propose a generalized ideal CSMA network model (GICN)\nto characterize the collision states as well as the interactions and dependency\namong links in the network.

In the previous paper, we\nconjectured that the knot state concentrates on the character variety of the\nknot with a given asymptotic behavior on the neighborhood of the abelian\nrepresentations. In the present paper we study the neighborhood of irreducible\nrepresentations. We conjecture that the knot state is Lagrangian with a phase\nand a symbol given respectively by the Chern-Simons and Reidemeister torsion\ninvariants. We show that under some mild assumptions, these conjectures imply\nthe Witten conjecture on the asymptotic expansion of WRT invariants of the Dehn\nfillings of the knot. Using microlocal techniques, we show that the figure\neight knot state satisfies our conjecture starting from q-differential\nrelations verified by the colored Jones polynomials. The proof relies on a\ndifferential equation satisfied by the Reidemeister torsion along the branches\nof the character variety, a phenomenon which has not been observed previously\nas far as we know.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 14:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-11"}

Phys. Rev. E 81,\n012901 (2010)). In this paper we discuss how this breakdown of thermodynamic\nequilibrium could be detected in microarray experiments without resorting to\nreal time hybridization data, which are difficult to implement in standard\nexperimental conditions. The method is based on the analysis of the\ndistribution of fluorescence intensities I from different spots for probes\ncarrying base mismatches. In thermal equilibrium and at sufficiently low\nconcentrations, log I is expected to be linearly related to the hybridization\nfree energy $\\Delta G$ with a slope equal to $1/RT_{exp}$, where $T_{exp}$ is\nthe experimental temperature and R is the gas constant. The breakdown of\nequilibrium results in the deviation from this law. A model for hybridization\nkinetics explaining the observed experimental behavior is discussed, the\nso-called 3-state model. It predicts that deviations from equilibrium yield a\nproportionality of $\\log I$ to $\\Delta G/RT_{eff}$. Here, $T_{eff}$ is an\neffective temperature, higher than the experimental one. This behavior is\nindeed observed in some experiments on Agilent arrays. We analyze experimental\ndata from two other microarray platforms and discuss, on the basis of the\nresults, the attainment of equilibrium in these cases. Interestingly, the same\n3-state model predicts a (dynamical) saturation of the signal at values below\nthe expected one at equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 14:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-22"}

These rankings try to maximize the expected utilities based on the user\nclick models. Recent empirical analysis on search engine logs suggests a\nunified click models for both ranked ads and search results. The segregated\nview of document and ad rankings does not consider this commonality. Further,\nthe used models consider parameters of (i) probability of the user abandoning\nbrowsing results (ii) perceived relevance of result snippets. But how to\nconsider them for improved ranking is unknown currently. In this paper, we\npropose a generalized ranking function---namely \"Click Efficiency (CE)\"---for\ndocuments and ads based on empirically proven user click models. The ranking\nconsiders parameters (i) and (ii) above, optimal and has the same time\ncomplexity as sorting. To exploit its generality, we examine the reduced forms\nof CE ranking under different assumptions enumerating a hierarchy of ranking\nfunctions. Some of the rankings in the hierarchy are currently used ad and\ndocument ranking functions; while others suggest new rankings. While optimality\nof ranking is sufficient for document ranking, applying CE ranking to ad\nauctions requires an appropriate pricing mechanism. We incorporate a second\nprice based pricing mechanism with the proposed ranking. Our analysis proves\nseveral desirable properties including revenue dominance over VCG for the same\nbid vector and existence of a Nash Equilibrium in pure strategies. The\nequilibrium is socially optimal, and revenue equivalent to the truthful VCG\nequilibrium. Further, we relax the independence assumption in CE ranking and\nanalyze the diversity ranking problem. We show that optimal diversity ranking\nis NP-Hard in general, and that a constant time approximation is unlikely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 15:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The intersection is\ntypically a set with desirable properties, but for which there is no efficient\nmethod of finding the closest point $B_{opt}$ in $\\M_1\\cap\\M_2$. We prove not\nonly that the sequence of alternating projections converges, but that the limit\npoint is fairly close to $B_{opt}$, in a manner relative to the distance\n$\\|B_0-B_{opt}\\|$, thereby significantly improving earlier results in the\nfield. A concrete example with applications to frequency estimation of signals\nis also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 13:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

This decrease\nis observed in both the negatively charged and neutral centers and is caused by\nshortening of the luminescence lifetimes of the centers of both types. In\ndarkness, the luminescence does not show any recovery on a time scale of 10\nmicroseconds but as little as three low-intensity pulses can return the\nluminescence to its previous, brighter state. An external magnetic field\nreduces the magnitude of the effect.
