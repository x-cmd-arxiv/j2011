Based on the analysis of the\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for red-giant-branch (RGB) stars, we derive a\ntip of RGB (TRGB)-based distance modulus to the galaxy of (m-M)_0 = 26.58 +/-\n0.11 (d = 2.1 +/- 0.1 Mpc). From the stellar density maps, we detect the\nasymmetrically disturbed, thick disk structure and two metal-poor overdense\nsubstructures in the north region of NGC55, which may correspond to merger\nremnants associated with hierarchical formation of NGC55's halo. In addition,\nwe identify a diffuse metal-poor halo extended out to at least z ~ 16 kpc from\nthe galactic plane. The surface-brightness profiles toward the z-direction\nperpendicular to the galactic plane suggest that the stellar density\ndistribution in the northern outer part of NGC55 is described by a locally\nisothermal disk at z <~ 6 kpc and a likely diffuse metal-poor halo with V-band\nsurface brightness of mu_V >~ 32 mag arcsec^{-2}, where old RGB stars dominate.\nWe derive the metallicity distributions (MDs) of these structures on the basis\nof the photometric comparison of RGB stars with the theoretical stellar\nevolutionary models. The MDs of the thick disk structures show the peak and\nmean metallicity of [Fe/H]peak ~ -1.4 and [Fe/H]mean ~ -1.7, respectively,\nwhile the outer substructures show more metal-poor features than the thick disk\nstructure. Combined with the current results with our previous study for M31's\nhalo, we discuss the possible difference in the formation process of stellar\nhalos among different Hubble types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 16:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

It is a binary\nsystem formed by two rather similar solar type stars with a projected\nseparation of 4.1 arcsec, which corresponds to 400 AU at the distance of 96 pc.\nThe two components are moderately metal-poor and the age of the system is about\n5 Gyr. We detected RV variations of HD 132563B with period of 1544 days and\nsemi-amplitude of 26 m/s. From the star characteristics and line profile\nmeasurements, we infer their Keplerian origin. Therefore HD 132563B turns out\nto host a planet with a projected mass msini=1.49 MJup at 2.6 AU with a\nmoderately eccentric orbit (e=0.22). The planet around HD 132563B is one of the\nfew that are known in triple stellar systems, as we found that the primary HD\n132563A is itself a spectroscopic binary with a period longer than 15 years and\nan eccentricity higher than 0.65. The spectroscopic component was not detected\nin adaptive-optics images taken with AdOpt@TNG, since it expected at a\nprojected separation that was smaller than 0.2 arcsec at the time of our\nobservations. A small excess in K band difference between the components with\nrespect to the difference in V band is compatible with a companion of about\n0.55 Msun. A preliminary statistical analysis of the occurrence of planets in\ntriple systems indicate a similar frequency of planets around the isolated\ncomponent in a triple system, components of wide binaries and single stars.\nThere is no significant iron abundance difference between the components. The\nlack of stars in binary systems and open clusters showing strong enhancements\nof iron abundance, comparable to the typical metallicity difference between\nstars with and without giant planets, agrees with the idea that accretion of\nplanetary material producing iron abundance anomalies larger than 0.1 dex is\nrare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 16:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We use different\napproaches (a geometrical model, a temperature-gradient model, and radiative\ntransfer models) to jointly model the observed interferometric visibilities and\nthe spectral energy distribution. The derived visibility values between ~0.02\nand ~0.3 show that the mid-infrared emission is clearly resolved. The\ncharacteristic size of the MIR-emission region is ~30-60 AU; this value is\ntypical for other YSOs with similar or somewhat lower luminosities. A\ncomparison of the sizes for the two position angles shows a significant\nelongation of the dust distribution. Simple spherical envelope models are\ntherefore inconsistent with the data. The radiative transfer modeling of our\ndata suggests that we observe a geometrically thin and optically thick\ncircumstellar disk with a mass of about 0.1 Msun. Our modeling indicates that\nNGC 2264 IRS 1 is surrounded by a flat circumstellar disk that has properties\nsimilar to disks typically found around lower-mass young stellar objects. This\nresult supports the assumption that massive young stellar objects form via\naccretion from circumstellar disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 17:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Our primary results include: (1) The linear tidal\nsolution often used in studies of binary evolution is unstable over much of the\nparameter space in which it is employed. More specifically, resonantly excited\ngravity waves are unstable to parametric resonance for companion masses M' >\n10-100 M_Earth at orbital periods P = 1-10 days. The nearly static equilibrium\ntide is, however, parametrically stable except for solar binaries with P < 2-5\ndays. (2) For companion masses larger than a few Jupiter masses, the dynamical\ntide causes waves to grow so rapidly that they must be treated as traveling\nwaves rather than standing waves. (3) We find a novel form of parametric\ninstability in which a single parent wave excites a very large number of\ndaughter waves (N = 10^3[P / 10 days]) and drives them as a single coherent\nunit with growth rates that are ~N times faster than the standard three wave\nparametric instability. (4) Independent of the parametric instability, tides\nexcite a wide range of stellar p-modes and g-modes by nonlinear inhomogeneous\nforcing; this coupling appears particularly efficient at draining energy out of\nthe dynamical tide and may be more important than either wave breaking or\nparametric resonance at determining the nonlinear dissipation of the dynamical\ntide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 18:59:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 16:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We identify galaxies with kinematical disturbances\n(from emission-lines in their 2D spectra) and find that they are more frequent\nin clusters than in the field. The fraction of kinematically-disturbed galaxies\nincreases with cluster velocity dispersion and decreases with distance from the\ncluster centre, but remains constant with projected galaxy density. We also\nstudied morphological disturbances in the stellar light from HST/F814W images,\nfinding that the fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies is similar in\nall environments. Moreover, there is little correlation between the presence of\nkinematically-disturbed gas and morphological distortions. We also study the\ndependence of the Tully-Fisher relation, star formation, and extent of the\nemission on environment, and conclude that the gas disks in cluster galaxies\nhave been truncated, and therefore their star formation is more concentrated\nthan in low-density environments. If spirals transform into S0s, our findings\nimply that the physical mechanism transforming cluster galaxies efficiently\ndisturbs the star-forming gas and reduces their specific star formation rate.\nMoreover, this star-forming gas is either removed more efficiently from the\noutskirts of the galaxies or is driven towards the centre (or both), helping to\nbuild the bulges of S0s. These results, in addition to the finding that the\ntransformation mechanism does not seem to induce strong morphological\ndisturbances on the galaxies, suggest that the physical processes involved are\nrelated to the intracluster medium, with galaxy-galaxy interactions playing\nonly a limited role in clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 19:52:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 10:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 11:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 09:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Low-mass star-forming cores differ from their surrounding molecular\ncloud in turbulence, shape, and density structure. Aims. We aim to understand\nhow dense cores form out of the less dense cloud material by studying the\nconnection between these two regimes. Methods. We observed the L1517 dark cloud\nin C18O(1-0), N2H+(1-0), and SO(JN=32-21) with the FCRAO 14m telescope, and in\nthe 1.2mm dust continuum with the IRAM 30m telescope. Results. Most of the gas\nin the cloud lies in four filaments that have typical lengths of 0.5 pc. Five\nstarless cores are embedded in these filaments and have chemical compositions\nindicative of different evolutionary stages. The filaments have radial profiles\nof C18O(1-0) emission with a central flattened region and a power-law tail, and\ncan be fitted approximately as isothermal, pressure-supported cylinders. The\nfilaments, in addition, are extremely quiescent. They have subsonic internal\nmotions and are coherent in velocity over their whole length. The large-scale\nmotions in the filaments can be used to predict the velocity inside the cores,\nindicating that core formation has not decoupled the dense gas kinematically\nfrom its parental material. In two filaments, these large-scale motions consist\nof oscillations in the velocity centroid, and a simple kinematic model suggests\nthat they may be related to core-forming flows. Conclusions. Core formation in\nL1517 seems to have occurred in two steps. First, the subsonic,\nvelocity-coherent filaments have condensed out of the more turbulent ambient\ncloud. Then, the cores fragmented quasi-statically and inherited the kinematics\nof the filaments.

At the shock, the flow\ncompresses and the alternating fields annihilate by driven magnetic\nreconnection. Irrespective of the stripe wavelength \"lambda\" or the wind\nmagnetization \"sigma\" (in the regime sigma>>1 of magnetically-dominated flows),\nshock-driven reconnection transfers all the magnetic energy of alternating\nfields to the particles, whose average Lorentz factor increases by a factor of\nsigma with respect to the pre-shock value. The shape of the post-shock spectrum\ndepends primarily on the ratio lambda/(r_L*sigma), where r_L is the\nrelativistic Larmor radius in the wind. The spectrum becomes broader as the\nvalue of lambda/(r_L*sigma) increases, passing from a relativistic Maxwellian\nto a flat power-law tail with slope around -1.5, populated by particles\naccelerated by the reconnection electric field. Close to the equatorial plane\nof the wind, where the stripes are symmetric, the highest energy particles\nresulting from magnetic reconnection can escape ahead of the shock, and be\ninjected into a Fermi-like acceleration process.

Our study suggests that the spectral\nbreak between the radio and the optical band in Pulsar Wind Nebulae can be a\nnatural consequence of particle acceleration at the termination shock of\nstriped pulsar winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 20:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

While addressing the\nreliability of such waveforms, previous studies have identified the PN\ncontribution as the dominant source of error, which can be reduced by\nincorporating longer NR simulations. Here we overcome the two outstanding\nissues that make it difficult to determine the minimum NR simulation length\nnecessary to produce suitably accurate hybrids: (1) the criteria for a GW\nsearch is the mismatch between the true waveform and a set of model waveforms,\noptimized over all waveforms in the model, but for discrete hybrids this\noptimization was not yet possible. (2) these calculations typically require\nthat numerical waveforms already exist, while we develop an algorithm to\nestimate hybrid mismatches errors without numerical data. Our procedure relies\non combining supposedly equivalent PN models at highest available order with\ncommon data in the NR regime, and their difference serves as a measure of the\nuncertainty assumed in each waveform. Contrary to some earlier studies, we\nestimate that ~10 NR orbits before merger should allow for the construction of\nwaveform families that are accurate enough for detection in a broad range of\nparameters, only excluding highly spinning, unequal-mass systems.

However, relatively little systematic work has been done to\nprovide coupled behavior-disease models able to close the feedback loop between\nbehavioral changes triggered in the population by an individual's perception of\nthe disease spread and the actual disease spread itself. While models lacking\nthis coupling can be extremely successful in mild epidemics, they obviously\nwill be of limited use in situations where social disruption or behavioral\nalterations are induced in the population by knowledge of the disease. Here we\npropose a characterization of a set of prototypical mechanisms for\nself-initiated social distancing induced by local and non-local\nprevalence-based information available to individuals in the population. We\ncharacterize the effects of these mechanisms in the framework of a\ncompartmental scheme that enlarges the basic SIR model by considering separate\nbehavioral classes within the population. The transition of individuals in/out\nof behavioral classes is coupled with the spreading of the disease and provides\na rich phase space with multiple epidemic peaks and tipping points. The class\nof models presented here can be used in the case of data-driven computational\napproaches to analyze scenarios of social adaptation and behavioral change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 22:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-10"}

Approximately 1/3\nof the sources show a significant excess (above that contributed by their\nstellar populations) of Na D absorption that can be robustly fitted with two\nVoigt profiles representing the Na D doublet. A further 1/6 of the sources show\nresidual absorption, for which the fits were not well constrained though while\n~50% of the sample show no significant residual absorption. The residual\nabsorption is modestly blueshifted, typically by ~50 km/s, but the velocity\ndispersions are high, generally ~500 km/s. Assuming that the size of the\nabsorbing region is consistent with ~1 kpc for dust lanes in a sample of\ngenerally more powerful radio sources and a continuous constant velocity flow\n(continuity equation), we estimate mass and energy outflow rates of about 10\nMsun/yr and few x e42 erg/s. These rates are consistent with those in the\nliterature based on HI absorption line observations of radio galaxies. The\nenergy required to power these outflows is on the order of 1-10% of the jet\nmechanical power and we conclude that the radio jet alone is sufficient. The\nmass and energy outflow rates are consistent with what is needed to heat/expel\nthe mass returned by the stellar populations as well as the likely amount of\ngas from a cooling halo. This suggests that radio-loud AGN play a key role in\nenergizing the outflow/heating phase of the feedback cycle. The deposition of\nthe jet mechanical energy could be important for explaining the ensemble\ncharacteristics of massive early type galaxies in the local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 06:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The X-ray\nspectrum of CTB 37A is well fitted by two components, a single-temperature\nionization equilibrium component (VMEKAL) with solar abundances, an electron\ntemperature of $kT_{\\rm e}\\sim0.6$ keV, absorbing column density of $N_{\\rm\nH}\\sim3\\times10^{22}$ ${\\rm cm^{-2}}$ and a power-law component with photon\nindex of $\\Gamma$ $\\sim 1.6$. The X-ray spectrum of CTB 37A is characterized by\nclearly detected K-shell emission lines of Mg, Si, S, and Ar. The plasma with\nsolar abundances supports the idea that the X-ray emission originates from the\nshocked interstellar material. The ambient gas density, and age of the remnant\nare estimated to be $\\sim1f^{-1/2}$${\\rm cm^{-3}}$ and\n$\\sim3\\times10^{4}f^{1/2}$ yr, respectively. The center-filling X-ray emission\nsurrounded by a shell-like radio structure and other X-ray properties indicate\nthat this remnant would be a new member of mixed-morphology supernova remnant\nclass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 08:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

For standard\ntheoretical parameters the SNR reaches middle to high double figures even with\nmodest assumptions about instrument performance and saddle approach. Obvious\nconcerns, like systematics arising from LPF self-gravity, or the Newtonian\nbackground, are examined and shown not to be a problem. We also investigate the\nimpact of a negative observational result upon the free-function determining\nthe theory. We demonstrate that, if Newton's gravitational constant is\nconstrained not be re-normalized by more than a few percent, only contrived\nMONDian free-functions would survive a negative result. There are exceptions,\ne.g. free-functions not asymptoting to 1 in the Newtonian limit, but rather\ndiverging or asymptoting to zero (depending on their mother relativistic\nMONDian theory). Finally, we scan the structure of all proposed relativistic\nMONDian theories, and classify them with regards to their non-relativistic\nlimit, finding three broad cases (with a few sub-cases depending on the form of\nthe free function). It is appears that only the Einstein-Aether formulation,\nand the sub-cases where the free-function does not asymptote to 1 in other\ntheories, would survive a negative result without resorting to \"designer\"\nfree-functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 09:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 15:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

In this paper we propose distributed algorithms for\nsampling networks, so that nodes are selected by a special node, called the\n\\emph{source}, with a given probability distribution. All these algorithms are\nbased on a new class of random walks, that we call Random Centrifugal Walks\n(RCW). A RCW is a random walk that starts at the source and always moves away\nfrom it.\n  Firstly, an algorithm to sample any connected network using RCW is proposed.\nThe algorithm assumes that each node has a weight, so that the sampling process\nmust select a node with a probability proportional to its weight. This\nalgorithm requires a preprocessing phase before the sampling of nodes. In\nparticular, a minimum diameter spanning tree (MDST) is created in the network,\nand then nodes' weights are efficiently aggregated using the tree. The good\nnews are that the preprocessing is done only once, regardless of the number of\nsources and the number of samples taken from the network. After that, every\nsample is done with a RCW whose length is bounded by the network diameter.\n  Secondly, RCW algorithms that do not require preprocessing are proposed for\ngrids and networks with regular concentric connectivity, for the case when the\nprobability of selecting a node is a function of its distance to the source.\n  The key features of the RCW algorithms (unlike previous Markovian approaches)\nare that (1) they do not need to warm-up (stabilize), (2) the sampling always\nfinishes in a number of hops bounded by the network diameter, and (3) it\nselects a node with the exact probability distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 10:46:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 May 2012 04:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 17:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-28"}

We\nimproved the calibration of optical-UV data from the UVOT and OM instruments\nand estimated the Lyalpha flux to disentangle the contributions from different\ncomponents in this spectral region. The observations reveal prominent\nvariability above 8 GHz. In the optical-UV band, the variability amplitude\ndecreases with increasing frequency due to a steadier radiation from both a\nbroad line region and an accretion disc. The optical flux reaches nearly the\nsame levels in the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 observing seasons; the mm one shows\nsimilar behaviour, whereas the gamma and X-ray flux levels rise in the second\nperiod. Two prominent gamma-ray flares in mid 2008 and late 2009 show a\ndouble-peaked structure, with a variable gamma/optical flux ratio. The X-ray\nflux variations seem to follow the gamma-ray and optical ones by about 0.5 and\n1 d, respectively. We interpret the multifrequency behaviour in terms of an\ninhomogeneous curved jet, where synchrotron radiation of increasing wavelength\nis produced in progressively outer and wider jet regions, which can change\ntheir orientation in time. In particular, we assume that the long-term\nvariability is due to this geometrical effect. By combining the optical and mm\nlight curves to fit the gamma and X-ray ones, we find that the gamma (X-ray)\nemission may be explained by inverse-Comptonisation of synchrotron optical (IR)\nphotons by their parent relativistic electrons (SSC process). A slight,\nvariable misalignment between the synchrotron and Comptonisation zones would\nexplain the increased gamma and X-ray flux levels in 2009-2010, as well as the\nchange in the gamma/optical flux ratio during the outbursts peaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 11:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

However, for many quantities, most notably orientations in\n3D, S is not a vector space, but a so-called manifold, i.e. it behaves like a\nvector space locally but has a more complex global topological structure. For\nintegrating these quantities, several ad-hoc approaches have been proposed.\n  Here, we present a principled solution to this problem where the structure of\nthe manifold S is encapsulated by two operators, state displacement [+]:S x R^n\n--> S and its inverse [-]: S x S --> R^n. These operators provide a local\nvector-space view \\delta; --> x [+] \\delta; around a given state x. Generic\nestimation algorithms can then work on the manifold S mainly by replacing +/-\nwith [+]/[-] where appropriate. We analyze these operators axiomatically, and\ndemonstrate their use in least-squares estimation and the Unscented Kalman\nFilter. Moreover, we exploit the idea of encapsulation from a software\nengineering perspective in the Manifold Toolkit, where the [+]/[-] operators\nmediate between a \"flat-vector\" view for the generic algorithm and a\n\"named-members\" view for the problem specific functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 13:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-07"}

We believe that an emphasis on low end-to-end delays between any two\nparties in the conference is a must, and the source sending rate in a session\nshould adapt to bandwidth availability and congestion. We present Celerity, a\nmulti-party conferencing solution specifically designed to achieve our\nobjectives. It is entirely Peer-to-Peer (P2P), and as such eliminating the cost\nof maintaining centrally administered servers. It is designed to deliver video\nwith low end-to-end delays, at quality levels commensurate with available\nnetwork resources over arbitrary network topologies where bottlenecks can be\nanywhere in the network. This is in contrast to commonly assumed P2P scenarios\nwhere bandwidth bottlenecks reside only at the edge of the network. The\nhighlight in our design is a distributed and adaptive rate control protocol,\nthat can discover and adapt to arbitrary topologies and network conditions\nquickly, converging to efficient link rate allocations allowed by the\nunderlying network. In accordance with adaptive link rate control, source video\nencoding rates are also dynamically controlled to optimize video quality in\narbitrary and unpredictable network conditions. We have implemented Celerity in\na prototype system, and demonstrate its superior performance over existing\nsolutions in a local experimental testbed and over the Internet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 14:14:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2011 08:28:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 09:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 16:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-31"}
