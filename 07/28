Gundlach et.\nal. demonstrated that such a scheme damps low amplitude, high frequency\nconstraint violating modes exponentially for the Z4 formulation of General\nRelativity. Here we analyze the effect of the damping scheme in numerical\napplications on a conformal decomposition of Z4. After reproducing the\ntheoretically predicted damping rates of constraint violations in the linear\nregime, we explore numerical solutions not covered by the theoretical analysis.\nIn particular we examine the effect of the damping scheme on low-frequency and\non high-amplitude perturbations of flat spacetime as well and on the long-term\ndynamics of puncture and compact star initial data in the context of spherical\nsymmetry. We find that the damping scheme is effective provided that the\nconstraint violation is resolved on the numerical grid. On grid noise the\ncombination of artificial dissipation and damping helps to suppress constraint\nviolations. We find that care must be taken in choosing the damping parameter\nin simulations of puncture black holes. Otherwise the damping scheme can cause\nundesirable growth of the constraints, and even qualitatively incorrect\nevolutions. In the numerical evolution of a compact static star we find that\nthe choice of the damping parameter is even more delicate, but may lead to a\nsmall decrease of constraint violation. For a large range of values it results\nin unphysical behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 17:04:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 10:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Many current or\nenvisioned P2P networks reward individuals for sharing files, via financial\nincentives or social recognition. Peers weigh this reward against the cost of\nsharing incurred when others download the shared file. As a result, if other\nnearby nodes share files as well, the cost to an individual node decreases.\nSuch positive network sharing effects can be expected to increase the rate of\npeers who share files.\n  In this paper, we formulate a natural model for the network effects of\nsharing behavior, which we term the \"demand model.\" We prove that the model has\ndesirable diminishing returns properties, meaning that the network benefit of\nincreasing payments decreases when the payments are already high. This result\nholds quite generally, for submodular objective functions on the part of the\nnetwork operator.\n  In fact, we show a stronger result: the demand model leads to a \"coverage\nprocess,\" meaning that there is a distribution over graphs such that\nreachability under this distribution exactly captures the joint distribution of\nnodes which end up sharing. The existence of such distributions has advantages\nin simulating and estimating the performance of the system. We establish this\nresult via a general theorem characterizing which types of models lead to\ncoverage processes, and also show that all coverage processes possess the\ndesirable submodular properties. We complement our theoretical results with\nexperiments on several real-world P2P topologies. We compare our model\nquantitatively against more na\\\"ive models ignoring network effects. A main\noutcome of the experiments is that a good incentive scheme should make the\nreward dependent on a node's degree in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 18:46:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 17:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

To realize this\nidea in galaxies we use a particular DM cored profile that contains three\nparameters: a scale length (rs) and density (rho_0) of the halo, and a core\nradius (rc) stemming from the relativistic nature of the BDM model. We test\nthis model by fitting rotation curves of seventeen Low Surface Brightness\ngalaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS). Since the energy Ec\nparameterizes the phase transition due to the underlying particle physics\nmodel, it is independent on the details of galaxy or structure formation and\ntherefore the DM profile parameters rs, rc, Ec are constrained, leaving only\ntwo free parameters.

The existence of this labile phase of a polymer has\nmany functional consequences in cytoskeletal dynamics, and its repeated\nappearance suggests that it is relatively easy to evolve. Here, we consider the\nminimal ingredients for the existence of dynamic instability by considering a\nsingle polymorphic filament that grows by binding to a substrate, undergoes a\nconformation change, and may unbind as a consequence of the residual strains\ninduced by this change. We identify two parameters that control the phase space\nof possibilities for the filament: a structural mechanical parameter that\ncharacterizes the ratio of the bond strengths along the filament to those with\nthe substrate (or equivalently the ratio of longitudinal to lateral\ninteractions in an assembly), and a kinetic parameter that characterizes the\nratio of time scales for growth and conformation change. In the deterministic\nlimit, these parameters serve to demarcate a region of uninterrupted growth\nfrom that of collapse. However, in the presence of disorder in either the\nstructural or the kinetic parameter the growth and collapse phases can coexist\nwhere the filament can grow slowly, shrink rapidly, and transition between\nthese phases, thus exhibiting dynamic instability.

The galaxy's ISM is\nconcentrated in the 42-kpc diameter starburst ring, but appears dominated by\natomic gas, with a global molecular fraction (f_mol) of only 7.9%. Apart from\nthe starburst peak, the gas ring is stable against the growth of gravitational\ninstabilities (Q_gas=2-7). Including stars lowers Q overall, but not enough to\nmake Q<1 everywhere. The ring's global star formation efficiency (SFE) appears\nsomewhat elevated, but varies around the ring by more than an order of\nmagnitude, peaking where star formation is most intense. AM0644-741's star\nformation law is peculiar: HI follows a Schmidt law while H2 is uncorrelated\nwith SFR/area. Photodissociation models yield low volume densities in the ring,\nparticularly in the starburst quadrant (n~2 cm^-3), implying a warm neutral\nmedium dominated ISM. At the same time, the ring's pressure and ambient\nfar-ultraviolet radiation field lead to the expectation of a predominantly\nmolecular ISM. We argue that the ring's peculiar star formation law, n, SFE,\nand f_mol result from the ISM's >100 Myr confinement time in the starburst\nring, which enhances the destructive effects of embedded massive stars and\nsupernovae. As a result, the ring's molecular ISM becomes dominated by small\nclouds where star formation is most intense, causing H2 to be underestimated by\n12CO line fluxes: in effect X(CO) >> X(Gal) despite the ring's solar\nmetallicity.

ProtoEXIST1 is the first implementation of an advanced CdZnTe\n(CZT) imaging detector in our ongoing program to establish the technology\nrequired for next generation wide-field hard X-ray telescopes. The CZT detector\nplane in ProtoEXIST1 consists of an 8 x 8 array of closely tiled 2 cm x 2 cm x\n0.5 cm thick pixellated CZT crystals, each with 8 x 8 pixels, covering a 256\ncm^2 active area with 2.5 mm pixels. A tungsten mask, mounted at 90 cm above\nthe detector provides shadowgrams of X-ray sources in the 30 - 600 keV band for\nimaging, allowing a fully coded field of view of 9 Deg x 9 Deg with an angular\nresolution of 20 arcmin. To reduce the background radiation, the detector is\nsurrounded by semi-graded (Pb/Sn/Cu) passive shields on the four sides all the\nway to the mask. On the back side, a 26 cm x 26 cm x 2 cm CsI(Na) active shield\nprovides signals to tag charged particle induced events as well as >~ 100 keV\nbackground photons from below.

The interpretation of aggregated\nflux limits implies new systematics not present for a single burst, such as by\nthe integration over parameter distributions (diffuse fluxes), or by the low\nstatistics in small burst samples (stacked fluxes). We simulate parameter\ndistributions with a Monte Carlo method computing the spectra burst by burst,\nas compared to a conventional Monte Carlo integration. With this approach, we\ncan predict the behavior of the flux in the diffuse limit as well as in low\nstatistics stacking samples, such as used in recent IceCube data analyses. We\nalso include the flavor composition at the detector (ratio between muon tracks\nand cascades) into our considerations.

On the other hand, we show that variations of the Lorentz boost\ncan only be interpreted in a model-dependent way, and can be used as a model\ndiscriminator.

Security-typed languages have therefore introduced\ndeclassification mechanisms for relaxing confidentiality policies, and\nendorsement mechanisms for relaxing integrity policies. However, a continuing\nchallenge has been to define what security is guaranteed when such mechanisms\nare used. This paper presents a new semantic framework for expressing security\npolicies for declassification and endorsement in a language-based setting. The\nkey insight is that security can be characterized in terms of the influence\nthat declassification and endorsement allow to the attacker. The new framework\nintroduces two notions of security to describe the influence of the attacker.\nAttacker control defines what the attacker is able to learn from observable\neffects of this code; attacker impact captures the attacker's influence on\ntrusted locations. This approach yields novel security conditions for checked\nendorsements and robust integrity. The framework is flexible enough to recover\nand to improve on the previously introduced notions of robustness and qualified\nrobustness. Further, the new security conditions can be soundly enforced by a\nsecurity type system. The applicability and enforcement of the new policies is\nillustrated through various examples, including data sanitization and\nauthentication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 21:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 13:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The asymmetric potential can rectify the\nmotion of vortices and cause a net flow without any unbiased external drive,\nwhich is called ratchet effect. With an applied ac current, the potential can\nrectify the motion of vortices in the channel and induce a dc net flow. We show\nthat the net flow of vortices strongly depends on vortex density and frequency\nof the driving current. Depending on the density, we distinguish a\n\"single-vortex\" rectification regime (low density) determined by the\npotential-energy landscape inside each cell of the channel (i.e., \"hard\" and\n\"easy\" directions of motion) and \"multi-vortex\", or \"collective\", rectification\n(high density) when the interaction between vortices becomes important. The\nfrequency of the driving ac current determines a possible distance that a\nvortex could move during one period. For high frequency current, vortices only\noscillate in the triangular cell. For low frequency, the vortex angular\nvelocity $\\omega$ increases nearly linearly until the driving force reaches the\nmaximum friction force in the hard direction. Furthermore, the commensurability\nbetween the number of vortices and the number of cells results in a stepwise\n$\\omega-I$ curve. Besides the integer steps, i.e., the large steps found in the\nsingle vortex case, we also found fractional steps corresponding to fractional\nratio between the numbers of vortices and triangular cells. The principal and\nfractional frequencies for different currents are found, when the net flow of\nvortices reaches the maximum that is proportional to the frequency when the\ndensity of vortices is low. We have performed preliminary measurements on a\ndevice containing a single weak-pinning circular ratchet channel in a Corbino\ngeometry and observed a substantial asymmetric vortex response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 21:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-10"}

The latter mechanism results in the\nrather slow (ballistic) law for the mean squared particle separation.

The planets \"tack\" and migrate outward\nwhen Saturn reaches the gap-opening mass and is caught in the 3:2 resonance\nwith Jupiter. The aim is to test the viability of the Grand Tack model and to\nstudy the dynamical evolution of Jupiter and Saturn during their growth from 10\nEarth masses cores. We have performed numerical simulations using a grid-based\nhydrodynamical code. Most of our simulations assume an isothermal equation of\nstate for the disk but a subset use a fully-radiative version of the code. For\nan isothermal disk the two phase migration of Jupiter and Saturn is very robust\nand independent of the mass-growth history of these planets provided the disk\nis cool enough. For a radiative disk the we find some outcomes with two phase\nmigrations and others with more complicated behavior. We construct a simple,\n1-D model of an evolving viscous disk to calculate the evolution of the disk's\nradiative properties: the disk transitions from radiative to isothermal from\nits outermost regions inward in time. We show that a two-phase migration is a\nnatural outcome at late times even under the limiting assumption that\nisothermal conditions are required.

As an attempt to discriminate among several possible\nproduction scenarios, astrophysicists try to test the statistical isotropy of\nthe directions of arrival of these cosmic rays. At the highest energies, they\nare supposed to point toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the\nobservations are so rare that testing the distribution of such samples of\ndirectional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose a\nnonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative\ndistributions and allows in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected\nforms of anisotropy. We explore two particular procedures. Both are derived\nfrom fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions of densities.\nWe use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594\n(electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale\nindices no larger than some ${J^{\\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between\nthose estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called\nMultiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each\nchoice of $J=1,\\ldots,{J^{\\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is\nbased on the single full ${J^{\\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet\ncoefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures\nand compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives to\nisotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic\nnonisotropic models based on Physics-inspired simulations. The Monte Carlo\nstudy shows good performance of the Multiple test, even at moderate sample\nsize, for a wide sample of alternative hypotheses and for different choices of\nthe parameter ${J^{\\star}}$. On the 69 most energetic events published by the\nPierre Auger Collaboration, the needlet-based procedures suggest statistical\nevidence for anisotropy. Using several values for the parameters of the\nmethods, our procedures yield $p$-values below 1%, but with uncontrolled\nmultiplicity issues. The flexibility of this method and the possibility to\nmodify it to take into account a large variety of extensions of the problem\nmake it an interesting option for future investigation of the origin of\nultrahigh energy cosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 09:33:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2012 00:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 13:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

Accordingly, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the\ndevelopment of efficient compression techniques for inverted indexes. Roughly,\nindex compression relies on two factors: the ordering of the indexed documents,\nwhich strives to position similar documents in proximity, and the encoding of\nthe inverted lists that result from the ordered stream of documents. Large\ncommercial search engines index tens of billions of pages of the ever growing\nWeb. The sheer size of their indexes dictates the distribution of documents\namong thousands of servers in a scheme called local index-partitioning, such\nthat each server indexes only several millions pages. Due to engineering and\nruntime performance considerations, random distribution of documents to servers\nis common. However, random index-partitioning among many servers adversely\nimpacts the resulting index sizes, as it decreases the effectiveness of\ndocument ordering schemes. We study the impact of random index-partitioning on\ndocument ordering schemes. We show that index-partitioning decreases the\naggregated size of the inverted lists logarithmically with the number of\nservers, when documents within each server are randomly reordered. On the other\nhand, the aggregated partitioned index size increases logarithmically with the\nnumber of servers, when state-of-the-art document ordering schemes, such as\nlexical URL sorting and clustering with TSP, are applied. Finally, we justify\nthe common practice of randomly distributing documents to servers, as we\nqualitatively show that despite its ill-effects on the ensuing compression, it\ndecreases key factors in distributed query evaluation time by an order of\nmagnitude as compared with partitioning techniques that compress better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 09:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-29"}

The primary aim is to characterise any\nevolution in the clustering amplitude of radio galaxies bellow z~0.68.\n  We find no evidence for evolution in the large-scale (~1-50h^{-1}Mpc)\nclustering amplitude. Our radio galaxy autocorrelations are consistent with\nprevious findings indicating little-to-no evolution in the redshift range 0.68\nto 0 (~6Gyr of time). We also cross correlate radio galaxies with the parent\nLRG samples to increase the precision of our results and again find no evidence\nfor evolution. Our results are inconsistent with a long-lived model for the\nclustering evolution that assumes radio sources randomly sample the LRG\npopulation. A model where the halo mass is constant with redshift is consistent\nwith the data. This is similar to QSOs that have clustering amplitudes\nconsistent with a single halo mass at all redshifts. Given that the brightest\nradio sources show stronger evolution in space density compared to fainter\nradio sources we restrict our samples to include only objects with\nL>10^{26}W/Hz and repeat the analysis. Again we find no evidence for evolution\nin the comoving correlation amplitude. These radio sources appear to inhabit\nthe same mass halos as fainter radio galaxies (~9x10^{13}h^{-1}M_\\odot).

Given a system and a real function (observable) defined on\nits phase space, extreme value theory studies the limit probabilistic laws\nobeyed by large values attained by the observable along orbits of the system.\nBased on this theory, the so-called block maximum method is often used in\napplications for statistical prediction of large value occurrences. In this\nmethod, one performs inference for the parameters of the Generalised Extreme\nValue (GEV) distribution, using maxima over blocks of regularly sampled\nobservations along an orbit of the system. The observables studied so far in\nthe theory are expressed as functions of the distance with respect to a point,\nwhich is assumed to be a density point of the system's invariant measure.\nHowever, this is not the structure of the observables typically encountered in\nphysical applications, such as windspeed or vorticity in atmospheric models. In\nthis paper we consider extreme value limit laws for observables which are not\nfunctions of the distance from a density point of the dynamical system. In such\ncases, the limit laws are no longer determined by the functional form of the\nobservable and the dimension of the invariant measure: they also depend on the\nspecific geometry of the underlying attractor and of the observable's level\nsets. We present a collection of analytical and numerical results, starting\nwith a toral hyperbolic automorphism as a simple template to illustrate the\nmain ideas. We then formulate our main results for a uniformly hyperbolic\nsystem, the solenoid map. We also discuss non-uniformly hyperbolic examples of\nmaps (H\\'enon and Lozi maps) and of flows (the Lorenz63 and Lorenz84 models).\nOur purpose is to outline the main ideas and to highlight several serious\nproblems found in the numerical estimation of the limit laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 10:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The motivation for this work\nis to investigate the rotation periods and photospheric spot patterns of these\nvery young stars, with a longer term view to probing the evolution of rotation\nand magnetic activity during the early phases of main-sequence evolution. We\nalso aim to derive information on key physical parameters, such as rotational\nvelocity and rotation period.

In the present study, we pursue a significant\naugmentation of our previous work by considering stars with zero-age main\nsequence masses between 0.5 and 2.0 M_sun with special emphasis on models of\n0.8, 0.9, 1.2 and 1.5 M_sun.

Considering that stars of relatively high masses depart from the\nmain-sequence much earlier than low-mass stars, it is found that the biospheric\nlife-span of super-Earth planets of stars with masses above approximately 1.5\nM_sun is always limited by the increase in stellar luminosity. However, for\nstars with masses below 0.9 M_sun, the life-span of super-Earths is solely\ndetermined by the geodynamic time-scale.

Diversity comes at\na price, however, since each new realization adds new unknown nonzero values,\nthus increasing uncertainty. In this paper, upper and lower bounds on joint\nsparsity pattern estimation are derived. These bounds, which improve upon\nexisting results even in the absence of diversity, illustrate key tradeoffs\nbetween the number of measurements, the accuracy of estimation, and the\ndiversity. It is shown, for instance, that diversity introduces a tradeoff\nbetween the uncertainty in the noise and the uncertainty in the nonzero values.\nMoreover, it is shown that the optimal amount of diversity significantly\nimproves the behavior of the estimation problem for both optimal and\ncomputationally efficient estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 15:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-29"}

This puts\nsevere constraints on models of the central engine and the jet acceleration in\nGRBs. These estimates are however obtained from a simplified single zone model.\nWe present here a more realistic calculation which takes into account the time,\nspace and direction dependent photon field existing in an outflow with several\nrelativistically moving emitting zones. The formalism is general and can be\napplied to many models of the prompt GRB emission. We present results obtained\nfor a numerical implementation in the framework of the internal shock model.

We provide an improved\napproximate formula for Gamma_min which is in good agreement with our numerical\nresults and can be directly applied to LAT GRB data; (ii) a delayed GeV onset\ncan be due to the time evolution of the opacity.

Overall, the scatter of the\nmass-SZ scaling relation is well correlated with the scatter in the mass-halo\nconcentration relation with more concentrated halos having stronger integrated\nSZ signals at fixed mass. Additional sources of intrinsic scatter are\nprojection effects from correlated structures, which cause the distribution of\nscatter to deviate from log-normality and skew it towards higher inferred\nmasses, and the dynamical state of clusters. We study the evolution of merging\nclusters based on simulations of 39 clusters and their cosmological environment\nwith high time resolution. This sample enables us to study for the first time\nthe detailed evolution of merging clusters around the scaling relation for a\ncosmologically representative distribution of merger parameters. Major mergers\ncause an asymmetric scatter such that the inferred mass of merging systems is\nbiased low. We find mergers to be the dominant source of bias towards low\ninferred masses: over 50% of outliers on this side of the scaling relation\nunderwent a major merger within the last Gigayear. As the fraction of\ndynamically disturbed clusters increases with redshift, our analysis indicates\nthat mergers cause a redshift-dependent bias in scaling relations. Furthermore,\nwe find the SZ morphology of massive clusters to be well correlated with the\nclusters' dynamical state, suggesting that morphology may be used to constrain\nmerger fractions and identify merger-induced outliers of the scaling relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 15:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

From a transit-based estimate of the host\nstar's mean density, combined with an estimate of the stellar effective\ntemperature T_eff=5630+/-100 K from high-resolution spectra, we infer a stellar\nhost mass of 1.061+/-0.067 M_sun and a stellar radius of 1.019+/-0.033 R_jup.\nWe estimate the planet mass and radius to be Mp=2.450+/-0.114 M_jup and\nRp=1.312+/-0.018 R_jup and a planet density near 1.35 g.cm-3.
