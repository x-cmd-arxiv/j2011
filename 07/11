Using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism (NEGF)\nanalysis of a small model QPC2, three ingredients were found to be essential to\ngenerate the strong spin polarization: an asymmetric lateral confinement, a\nLSOC induced by the lateral confining potential of the QPC, and a strong\nelectron-electron (e-e) interaction. In this paper, NEGF is used to study how\nthe spin polarization is affected by the presence of impurities in the central\nportion of the QPC. It is found that the number, location, and shape of the\nconductance anomalies, occurring below the first quantized conductance plateau\n(G0=2e2/h), are strongly dependent on the nature (attractive or repulsive) and\nthe locations of the impurities. We show that the maximum of the conductance\nspin polarization is affected by the presence of impurities.

We find that scatter and selection biases can hide the intrinsic\ncorrelations between black holes and their hosts, with 'observable' subsamples\nof the whole population suggesting, on average, positive evolution even when\nthe underlying population is characterized by no- or negative evolution. We\ncreate theoretical mass functions of black holes convolving the mass function\nof dark matter halos with standard relationships linking black holes with their\nhosts. Under these assumptions, we find that the local MBH - sigma correlation\nis unable to fit the z = 6 black hole mass function proposed by Willott et al.\n(2010), overestimating the number density of all but the most massive black\nholes. Positive evolution or including scatter in the MBH - sigma correlation\nmakes the discrepancy worse, as it further increases the number density of\nobservable black holes. We notice that if the MBH - sigma correlation at z = 6\nis steeper than today, then the mass function becomes shallower. This helps\nreproducing the mass function of z = 6 black holes proposed by Willott et al.\n(2010). Alternatively, it is possible that very few halos (of order 1/1000)\nhost an active massive black hole at z = 6, or that most AGN are obscured,\nhindering their detection in optical surveys. Current measurements of the high\nredshift black hole mass function might be underestimating the density of low\nmass black holes if the active fraction or luminosity are a function of host or\nblack hole mass.

The objective is\nto minimize the length of a codeword sent to all receivers which allows each\nreceiver to learn its bit. For linear index coding, the minimum possible length\nis known to be equal to a graph parameter called minrank (Bar-Yossef et al.,\nFOCS, 2006).\n  We show a polynomial time algorithm that, given an n vertex graph G with\nminrank k, finds a linear index code for G of length $\\widetilde{O}(n^{f(k)})$,\nwhere f(k) depends only on k. For example, for k=3 we obtain f(3) ~ 0.2574. Our\nalgorithm employs a semidefinite program (SDP) introduced by Karger, Motwani\nand Sudan (J. ACM, 1998) for graph coloring and its refined analysis due to\nArora, Chlamtac and Charikar (STOC, 2006). Since the SDP we use is not a\nrelaxation of the minimization problem we consider, a crucial component of our\nanalysis is an upper bound on the objective value of the SDP in terms of the\nminrank.\n  At the heart of our analysis lies a combinatorial result which may be of\nindependent interest. Namely, we show an exact expression for the maximum\npossible value of the Lovasz theta-function of a graph with minrank k. This\nyields a tight gap between two classical upper bounds on the Shannon capacity\nof a graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 08:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The progress in the study of PRGs is constrained by a small\nnumber of known objects of this type. Up to date, we can only attribute about\ntwo dozens of kinematically-confirmed galaxies to this class, mostly from\nWhitmore et al. (1990) catalogue. We present a new catalogue of PRGs based on\nthe results of the original Galaxy Zoo project. Based on the preliminary\nclassification of the Galaxy Zoo, we viewed more than 40000 images of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) and selected 275 galaxies, included in our catalogue.\nOur Sloan-based Polar Ring Catalog (SPRC) contains 70 galaxies that we\nclassified as \"the best candidates\", among which we expect to have a very high\nproportion of true PRGs, and 115 good PRG candidates. 53 galaxies are\nclassified as PRG related objects.We identified 37 galaxies that have their\npresumed polar rings seen almost face-on. The SPRC objects are on the average\nfainter and located further away than the galaxies from the catalog by Whitmore\net al., although our catalogue does include dozens of new nearby candidate\nPRGs. The new catalogue significantly increases the number of genuine PRG\ncandidates, and may serve as a good basis both for the further detailed study\nof individual galaxies, and for the statistical analysis of PRGs as a separate\nclass of objects. We performed spectroscopic observations of six galaxies from\nthe SPRC at the 6-m telescope. The existence of polar rings was confirmed in\nfive galaxies, and one object appeared to be a projection of a pair of\ngalaxies. Adding the literature data, we can already classify 10 galaxies from\nour catalogue to the kinematically-confirmed PRGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 08:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Our spectra of textbook explosive events with\nsimultaneous Doppler flow of a red and of a blue component are extreme cases of\nhigh spectro-scopic velocities that lack apparent motion, to be expected if\ninterpreted as a pair of collimated, linearly moving jets. The awareness of\nthis conflict led us to the alternate interpretation of redshift and blueshift\nas spinning motion of a small plasma volume. In contrast to the bidirectional\njet scenario, a small volume of spinning plasma would be fully compatible with\nthe observation of flows without detectable apparent motion. We suspect that\nthese small volumes could be spicule-like structures and try to find evidence.\nWe show observations of helical motion in macrospicules and argue that these\nfeatures - if scaled down to a radius comparable to the slit size of a\nspectrometer - should have a spectroscopic signature similar to that observed\nin explosive events, while not easily detectable by imagers. Despite of this\ndifficulty, evidence of helicity in spicules has been reported in the\nliterature. This inspired us to the new insight that the same narrow spinning\nstructures may be the drivers in both cases, structures that imagers observe as\nspicules and that in spectrometers cross the slit and are seen as explosive\nevents. We arrive at a concept that supports the idea that explosive events and\nspicules are different manifestations of the same helicity driven scenario.\nConsequently, in such a case, a photospheric or subphotosperic trigger has to\nbe assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 08:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Possible reasons for this pointed to grain surface chemistry.\nHow- ever, organic molecules and water, which are both ice constituents, do not\nenjoy the same deuteration. For example, deuterated formaldehyde is very\nabundant in comets and star forming regions, while deuterated water rarely is.\nIn this article, we explain this selective deuteration by following the\nformation of ices (using the rate equation method) in translucent clouds, as\nwell as their evolu- tion as the cloud collapses to form a star. Ices start\nwith the deposition of gas phase CO and O onto dust grains. While reaction of\noxygen with atoms (H or D) or molecules (H2) yields H2O (HDO), CO only reacts\nwith atoms (H and D) to form H2CO (HDCO, D2CO). As a result, the deuteration of\nformaldehyde is sensitive to the gas D/H ratio as the cloud undergoes\ngravitational collapse, while the deuteration of water strongly depends on the\ndust temperature at the time of ice formation. These results reproduce well the\ndeuterium fractionation of formaldehyde observed in comets and star forming\nregions and can explain the wide spread of deuterium fractionation of water\nobserved in these environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 10:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 10:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We detect the H2 1-0 S(1) line toward HD 100546 and\nHD 97048. In the other 13 targets, the line is not detected. The H2 1-0 S(0)\nand 2-1 S(1) lines are undetected in all sources. This is the first detection\nof near-IR H2 emission in HD 100546. The H2 1-0 S(1) lines observed in HD\n100546 and HD 97048 are observed at a velocity consistent with the rest\nvelocity of both stars, suggesting that they are produced in the circumstellar\ndisk. In HD 97048, the emission is spatially resolved and it is observed to\nextend at least up to 200 AU. We report an increase of one order of magnitude\nin the H2 1-0 S(1) line flux with respect to previous measurements taken in\n2003 for this star, which suggests line variability. In HD 100546 the emission\nis tentatively spatially resolved and may extend at least up to 50 AU.

The upper limits for the line\nratios for HD 100546 are inconclusive. Because the H2 emission is located at\nlarge radii, for both sources a thermal emission scenario (i.e., gas heated by\ncollisions with dust) is implausible. We argue that the observation of H2\nemission at large radii may be indicative of an extended disk atmosphere at\nradii >5 AU.

The proposed models, fairly insensitive to the conventional SUSY\nsearches in the jets + $\\etslash$ and other channels, yield observable signal\nin the suggested channel for $\\lum \\gsim 1 \\ifb$ of data. They are also\nconsistent with the LMNDM scenario and can be tested by the direct dark matter\nsearch experiments in the near future. Some of these models can be realized by\nnon-universal scalar and gaugino masses at the GUT scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 11:16:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 09:53:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 12:31:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 13:41:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 12:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

Hence, one has to recur the results of data races to\ndeterministically replay a multi-threaded program. However, data races are\nconcealed in enormous number of memory operations in a program. Due to the\ndifficulty of accurately identifying data races, previous multi-threaded\ndeterministic record/replay schemes for commodity multi-processor system give\nup to record data races directly. Consequently, they either record all shared\nmemory operations, which brings remarkable slowdown to the production run, or\nrecord the synchronization only, which introduces significant efforts to\nreplay.\n  Inspired by the advances in data race detection, we propose an efficient\nsoftware-only deterministic replay scheme for commodity multi-processor\nsystems, which is named RacX. The key insight of RacX is as follows: although\nit is NP-hard to accurately identify the existence of data races between a pair\nof memory operations, we can find out all potential data races in a\nmulti-threaded program, in which the false positives can be reduced to a small\namount with our automatic false positive reduction techniques. As a result,\nRacX can efficiently monitor all potential data races to deterministically\nreplay a multi-threaded program.\n  To evaluate RacX, we have carried out experiments over a number of well-known\nmulti-threaded programs from SPLASH-2 benchmark suite and large-scale\ncommercial programs. RacX can precisely recur production runs of these programs\nwith value determinism. Averagely, RacX causes only about 1.21%, 1.89%, 2.20%,\nand 8.41% slowdown to the original run during recording (for 2-, 4-, 8- and\n16-thread programs, respectively).

We utilize perturbation-response scanning (PRS) technique, coupled with\nmolecular dynamics simulations to analyze conformational preferences of\ncalcium-loaded CaM, initially in extended form. PRS is comprised of sequential\napplication of directed forces on residues followed by recording the resulting\ncoordinates. We show that manipulation of a single residue, E31 located in one\nof the EF hand motifs, reproduces structural changes to compact forms, and the\nflexible linker acts as a transducer of binding information to distant parts of\nthe protein. Independently, using four different pKa calculation strategies, we\nfind E31 to be the charged residue (out of 52), whose ionization state is most\nsensitive to subtle pH variations in the physiological range. It is proposed\nthat at relatively low pH, CaM structure is less flexible. By gaining charged\nstates at specific sites at a pH value around 7, local conformational changes\nin the protein will lead to shifts in the energy landscape, paving the way to\nother conformational states. These findings are in accordance with FRET\nmeasured shifts in conformational distributions towards more compact forms with\ndecreased pH.

Ceres is the most massive body of the asteroid belt and contains\nabout 25 wt.% (weight percent) of water. Understanding its thermal evolution\nand assessing its current state are major goals of the Dawn Mission.\nConstraints on internal structure can be inferred from various observations.\nEspecially, detailed knowledge of the rotational motion can help constrain the\nmass distribution inside the body, which in turn can lead to information on its\ngeophysical history. Aims. We investigate the signature of the interior on the\nrotational motion of Ceres and discuss possible future measurements performed\nby the spacecraft Dawn that will help to constrain Ceres' internal structure.\nMethods. We compute the polar motion, precession-nutation, and length-of-day\nvariations. We estimate the amplitudes of the rigid and non-rigid response for\nthese various motions for models of Ceres interior constrained by recent shape\ndata and surface properties. Results. As a general result, the amplitudes of\noscillations in the rotation appear to be small, and their determination from\nspaceborne techniques will be challenging. For example, the amplitudes of the\nsemi-annual and annual nutations are around ~364 and ~140 milli-arcseconds, and\nthey show little variation within the parametric space of interior models\nenvisioned for Ceres. This, combined with the very long-period of the\nprecession motion, requires very precise measurements. We also estimate the\ntimescale for Ceres' orientation to relax to a generalized Cassini State, and\nwe find that the tidal dissipation within that object was probably too small to\ndrive any significant damping of its obliquity since formation. However,\ncombining the shape and gravity observations by Dawn offers the prospect to\nidentify departures of non-hydrostaticity at the global and regional scale,\nwhich will be instrumental in constraining Ceres' past and current thermal\nstate. We also discuss the existence of a possible Chandler mode in the\nrotational motion of Ceres, whose potential excitation by endogenic and/or\nexogenic processes may help detect the presence of liquid reservoirs within the\nasteroid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 15:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We define an\ninteracting historical particle process describing the genealogies of the\nliving individuals; it takes values in the space of point measures on an\ninfinite dimensional c\\`adl\\`ag path space. This individual-based process can\nbe approximated by a nonlinear historical superprocess, under the assumptions\nof large populations, small individuals and allometric demographies. Because of\nthe interactions, the branching property fails and we use martingale problems\nand fine couplings between our population and independent branching particles.\nOur convergence theorem is illustrated by two examples of current interest in\nbiology. The first one relates the biodiversity history of a population and its\nphylogeny, while the second treats a spatial model with competition between\nindividuals through their past trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 15:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 20:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 14:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-20"}

To achieve spatial cloaking, the index of refraction is manipulated\nto flow light from a probe around an object in such a way that a \"hole\" in\nspace is created, and it remains hidden. Alternatively, it may be desirable to\ncloak the occurrence of an event over a finite time period, and the idea of\ntemporal cloaking was proposed in which the dispersion of the material is\nmanipulated in time to produce a \"time hole\" in the probe beam to hide the\noccurrence of the event from the observer. This approach is based on\naccelerating and slowing down the front and rear parts, respectively, of the\nprobe beam to create a well controlled temporal gap in which the event occurs\nso the probe beam is not modified in any way by the event. The probe beam is\nthen restored to its original form by the reverse manipulation of the\ndispersion. Here we present an experimental demonstration of temporal cloaking\nby applying concepts from the time-space duality between diffraction and\ndispersive broadening. We characterize the performance of our temporal cloak by\ndetecting the spectral modification of a probe beam due to an optical\ninteraction while the cloak is turned off and on and show that the event is\nobserved when the cloak is turned off but becomes undetectable when the cloak\nis turned on. These results are a significant step toward the development of\nfull spatio-temporal cloaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 15:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
