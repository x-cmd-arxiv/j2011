In the above formulas, the tetragonal field\nparameters $Ds$ and $Dt$ are determined from the superposition model, by\nconsidering the relative axial elongation of the oxygen octahedron around the\nCu$^{2+}$ due to the Jahn-Teller effect. Based on the calculations, the\nrelative elongation ratios of about 5% and 3% are obtained for the tetragonal\nCu$^{2+}$ centers $A1$ and $A2$, respectively. The theoretical spin Hamiltonian\nparameters are in good agreement with the observed values for both systems. The\nlarger axial elongation in center $A1$ is ascribed to the more significant low\nsymmetrical (tetragonal) distortion of the Jahn-Teller effect. The local\nstructures characterized by the above axial elongations are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 16:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-20"}

We assess the efficiency of\nthis diagnostic by examining the 12mu IRAS AGN sample for which high\nsignal-to-noise XMM observations have been recently become available. We find\nthat the vast majority (10/11) of the AGN that have been classified as CT on\nthe basis the X-ray spectroscopy by Brightman & Nandra present a low Lx/L6\nluminosity ratio, i.e. lower than a few percent of the average AGN ratio which\nis typical of reflection-dominated CT sources. At low Lx/L6 ratios we also find\na comparable number of AGN, most of which are heavily absorbed but not CT. This\nimplies that although most Compton-thick AGN present low Lx/L6 ratios, at least\nin the local, Universe, the opposite is not necessarily true. Next, we extend\nour analysis to higher redshifts. We perform the same analysis in the CDFS\nwhere excellent quality chandra (4 Ms) and xmm (3 Ms) X-ray spectra are\navailable. We derive accurate X-ray luminosities for chandra sources using\nX-ray spectral fits, as well as 6mu luminosities from SED fits. We find 8 AGN\nwith low Lx/L6 ratios in total, after excluding one source where the 6mu\nemission primarily comes from star-formation. One of these sources has been\nalready demonstrated to host a CT nucleus, while for another one at a redshift\nof z=1.22 we argue it is most likely CT on the basis of its combined chandra\nand xmm spectrum. We find a large number of non CT contaminant with low Lx/L6\nratios. The above suggest that a low Lx/L6 ratio alone cannot ascertain the\npresence of a CT AGN, albeit the majority of low Lx/L6 AGN are heavily\nobscured. The two most reliable CT AGN in the high redshift Universe have high\nLx/L6 ratios, showing that this method cannot provide complete CT AGN samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 17:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

No-Scale F-SU(5) is a model defined by the confluence of the\nF-lipped SU(5) Grand Unified Theory, two pairs of hypothetical TeV scale\nvector-like supersymmetric multiplets with origins in F-theory, and the\ndynamically established boundary conditions of No-Scale Supergravity. When\nsearching for a five standard deviation signal, we find that the CMS experiment\nat the \\sqrt{s} = 7 TeV LHC began to penetrate the phenomenologically viable\nparameter space of this model at just under 1/fb of integrated luminosity, and\nthat the majority of this space remains intact, subsequent to analyses of the\nfirst 1.1/fb of CMS data.

In this work, we\nuse cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to model the impact of this blazar\nheating on the Lyman-alpha forest at redshifts z~2-3. We find that blazar\nheating produces an inverted temperature-density relation in the IGM and\nnaturally resolves many of the problems present in previous simulations of the\nforest that included photoheating alone. In particular, our simulations with\nblazar heating simultaneously reproduce the observed effective optical depth\nand temperature as a function of redshift, the observed probability\ndistribution functions of the transmitted flux, and the observed flux power\nspectra, over the full redshift range 2<z<3 analysed here. Additionally, by\ndeblending the Lyman-alpha forest into a sum of thermally broadened individual\nlines, we find superb agreement with the observed lower cutoff of the\nline-width distribution and abundances of neutral hydrogen column densities.\nUsing the most recent constraints on the cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background,\nthis excellent agreement with observations does not require rescaling the\namplitude of the UV background; a procedure that was routinely used in the past\nto match the observed level of transmitted flux.

This concordance between Lyman-alpha data and\nsimulations, which are based on the most recent cosmological parameters,\nsuggests that the inclusion of blazar heating alleviates previous tensions on\nconstraints for sigma_8 derived from Lyman-alpha measurements and other\ncosmological data.

An important problem has been that standard migration\ntheories predict very rapid inward migration, which poses problems for\npopulation synthesis models. However, it has been shown recently that low-mass\nplanets (20-30 Earth Masses) that are still embedded in the protoplanetary disc\ncan migrate outwards under certain conditions. Simulations have been performed\nmostly for planets at given radii for a particular disc model. Here, we plan to\nextend previous work and consider different masses of the disc to quantify the\ninfluence of the physical disc conditions on planetary migration. We perform\nthree-dimensional (3D) radiation hydrodynamical simulations of embedded planets\nin protoplanteary discs. For planets on circular orbits at various locations we\nmeasure the radial dependece of the torques. For all considered planet masses\n(20-30 Earth masses) in this study we find outward migration within a limited\nradial range of the disc, typically from about 0.5 up to 1.5-2.5 a_Jup. Inside\nand outside this intervall, migration is inward and given by the Lindblad value\nfor large radii. Because outward migration stops at a certain location in the\ndisc, there exists a zero-torque distance for planetary embryos, where they can\ncontinue to grow without moving too fast. For higher disc masses (M_disc > 0.02\nM_Sol) convection ensues, which changes the structure of the disc and therefore\nthe torque on the planet as well. Outward migration stops at different points\nin the disc for different planetary masses, resulting in a quite extended\nregion where the formation of larger cores might be easier. In higher mass\ndiscs, convection changes the disc's structure resulting in fluctuations in the\nsurface density, which influence the torque acting on the planet, and therefore\nits migration rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 20:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 08:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 09:38:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 16:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 18:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

The\nproposed architecture is based on a family of network-MIMO schemes defined by\nsmall clusters of cooperating base stations, zero-forcing multiuser MIMO\nprecoding with suitable inter-cluster interference constraints, uplink pilot\nsignals reuse across cells, and frequency reuse. The key idea consists of\npartitioning the users population into geographically determined \"bins\", such\nthat all users in the same bin are statistically equivalent, and use the\noptimal network-MIMO architecture in the family for each bin. A scheduler takes\ncare of serving the different bins on the time-frequency slots, in order to\nmaximize a desired network utility function that captures some desired notion\nof fairness. This results in a mixed-mode network-MIMO architecture, where\ndifferent schemes, each of which is optimized for the served user bin, are\nmultiplexed in time-frequency.

The number of Pareto-optimal solutions (i.e.,\nsolutions with the property that no other solution is at least as good in all\nthe coordinates and better in at least one) for multiobjective optimization\nproblems is the central object of study. In this paper, we prove several lower\nbounds for the expected number of Pareto optima. Our basic result is a lower\nbound of \\Omega_d(n^(d-1)) for optimization problems with d objectives and n\nvariables under fairly general conditions on the distributions of the linear\nobjectives.

In order to investigate the influence of mass transfer\nefficiency in the models and simulations, a set of models are also calculated\nby implementing a constant mass transfer efficiency, $\\beta$=0.5 during Roche\nlobe overflow (Case A binary evolution excluded). The result shows BSs can be\nformed via mass transfer at any given age in both cases. However, the\ndistributions of the BS populations on CMD are different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 02:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Integration of data across scales can only be successful\nif the combined networks show a similar architecture. One way to compare\nnetworks is to look at spatial features, based on fibre length, and topological\nfeatures of individual nodes where outlier nodes form single node motifs whose\nfrequency yields a fingerprint of the network. Here, we observe how\ncharacteristic single node motifs change over age (12-23 years) and network\nsize (414, 813, and 1615 nodes) for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) structural\nconnectivity in healthy human subjects. First, we find the number and diversity\nof motifs in a network to be strongly correlated. Second, comparing different\nscales, the number and diversity of motifs varied across the temporal (subject\nage) and spatial (network resolution) scale: certain motifs might only occur at\none spatial scale or for a certain age range. Third, regions of interest which\nshow one motif at a lower resolution may show a range of motifs at a higher\nresolution which may or may not include the original motif at the lower\nresolution. Therefore, both the type and localisation of motifs differ for\ndifferent spatial resolutions. Our results also indicate that spatial\nresolution has a higher effect on topological measures whereas spatial\nmeasures, based on fibre lengths, remain more comparable between resolutions.\nTherefore, spatial resolution is crucial when comparing characteristic node\nfingerprints given by topological and spatial network features. As node motifs\nare based on topological and spatial properties of brain connectivity networks,\nthese conclusions are also relevant to other studies using connectome analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 07:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

Flexion estimates rely on measurements of\ngalaxy-shape distortions with spin-1 and spin-3 symmetry. We show in this paper\nthat and how such distortions are generally caused not only by the flexion\nitself, but also by coupling terms of the form (shear $\\times$ flexion), which\nhave hitherto been neglected. Similar coupling terms occur between intrinsic\ngalaxy ellipticities and the flexion. We show, by means of numerical tests,\nthat neglecting these terms can introduce biases of up to 85% on the $F$\nflexion and 150% on the $G$ flexion for galaxies with an intrinsic ellipticity\ndispersion of $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}=0.3$. In general, this bias depends on the\nstrength of the lensing fields, the ellipticity dispersion, and the\nconcentration of the lensed galaxies. We derive a new set of equations relating\nthe measured spin-1 and spin-3 distortions to the lensing fields up to first\norder in the shear, the flexion, the product of shear and flexion, and the\nmorphological properties of the galaxy sample. We show that this new\ndescription is accurate with a bias $\\leq 7%$ (spin-1 distortion) and $\\leq 3%$\n(spin-3 distortion) even close to points where the flexion approach breaks down\ndue to merging of multiple images. We propose an explanation why a spin-3\nsignal could not be measured yet and comment on the difficulties in using a\nmodel-fitting approach to measure the flexion signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 08:55:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 16:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In order to\nsimulate the closure of the bond between the Pt and 5'-guanine-N7 atoms, the\nforces acting between them were gradually increased during MD. After 500-800 ps\nthe transformation of the mono-adduct (straight DNA with the cisplatin residue\nlinked to one guanine-N7) to the bus-adduct (bent DNA where Pt atom is\nconnected through the N7 atoms of neighboring guanines) was observed.

For example, when a two component Fermi mixture is\nquenched to the BEC side of the Feshbach resonance, a positive scattering\nlength suggests that interactions are repulsive and thus collective dynamics\nshould be dominated by the Stoner instability toward a spin polarized\nferromagnetic state.

In this time-delayed\npathway, an electron returns to its parent ion, and, by recolliding with the\ncore, gives part of its kinetic energy to excite a second electron at a time\n$t^{\\prime}$. The second electron then reaches the continuum at a later time\n$t$ by tunneling ionization. We show that, if $t^{\\prime}$ and $t$ are complex,\nthe condition that recollision of the first electron occurs before tunnel\nionization of the second electron translates into boundary conditions for the\nsteepest-descent contours, and thus puts constraints on the saddles to be taken\nwhen computing the RESI transition amplitudes. We also show that this\ngeneralized causality condition has a dramatic effect in the shapes of the RESI\nelectron momentum distributions for few-cycle laser pulses.

The\nrelative lack of star-forming galaxies with 1E10<=M^stars<=1E11 M_sun is\nconfirmed by the galaxy distribution in the b-r vs i color-magnitude diagram.\nHence, the 2 fossil groups appear as more mature than the coeval, similarly\nmassive groups.

We have also done the first systematic X-ray spectral study of XB\n1254-690, and found that, while one-component models are inadequate,\nthree-component models are not required by the data. We have concluded that a\ncombined broken-powerlaw and Comptonization model best describes the source\ncontinuum spectrum among 19 two-component models. The plasma temperature (~ 3\nkeV) and the optical depth (~ 7) of the Comptonization component are consistent\nwith the previously reported values for other sources. However, the use of a\nbroken-powerlaw component to describe NS LMXB spectra has recently been\nstarted, and we have used this component for XB 1254-690 for the first time. We\nhave attempted to determine the relative energy budgets of the accretion disc\nand the boundary layer using the best-fit spectral model, and concluded that a\nreliable estimation of these budgets requires correlations among time\nvariations of spectral properties in different wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 14:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

The rotational stability of the fastest\npulsars means that timing of an array of these objects can be used to detect\nand investigate gravitational waves. Simultaneously, however, pulsar timing is\nused to estimate spin period, period derivative, astrometric, and binary\nparameters. Here we calculate the effects that a stochastic background of\ngravitational waves has on pulsar timing parameters through the use of\nsimulations and data from the millisecond pulsars PSR J0437--4715 and PSR\nJ1713+0747. We show that the reported timing uncertainties become\nunderestimated with increasing background amplitude by up to a factor of\n$\\sim10$ for a stochastic gravitational-wave background amplitude of $A=5\\times\n10^{-15}$, where $A$ is the amplitude of the characteristic strain spectrum at\none-year gravitational wave periods.

In such systems\nontologies capture formalized vocabularies of terms shared by its users.\nHowever in many cases users have different local views of the domain, i.e. of\nthe context in which a given term is used. Inappropriate usage of terms\ntogether with natural complications when formulating and understanding logical\ndescriptions may result in faulty ontologies. Recent ontology debugging\napproaches use diagnosis methods to identify causes of the faults. In most\ndebugging scenarios these methods return many alternative diagnoses, thus\nplacing the burden of fault localization on the user. This paper demonstrates\nhow the target diagnosis can be identified by performing a sequence of\nobservations, that is, by querying an oracle about entailments of the target\nontology. To identify the best query we propose two query selection strategies:\na simple \"split-in-half\" strategy and an entropy-based strategy. The latter\nallows knowledge about typical user errors to be exploited to minimize the\nnumber of queries. Our evaluation showed that the entropy-based method\nsignificantly reduces the number of required queries compared to the\n\"split-in-half\" approach. We experimented with different probability\ndistributions of user errors and different qualities of the a-priori\nprobabilities. Our measurements demonstrated the superiority of entropy-based\nquery selection even in cases where all fault probabilities are equal, i.e.\nwhere no information about typical user errors is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 10:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Apr 2014 10:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}
