However, in dimensions higher than 1\nthe equality can hold for only finitely many eigenfunctions. Thus, a \"nodal\ndeficiency\" arises. Examples are known of eigenfunctions with arbitrarily large\nindex $n$ that have just two nodal domains.\n  It was suggested in the recent years to look at the partitions of the domain,\nrather than eigenfunctions. It was shown in a recent paper by Helffer,\nHoffmann-Ostenhof and Terracini that (under some natural conditions) bipartite\npartitions minimizing the maximum of the ground-state energies in sub-domains\nof the partition, correspond to the \"Courant sharp\" eigenfunctions, i.e. to\nthose with zero nodal deficiency.\n  In this paper, the authors show, under some genericity conditions, among the\nbipartite equipartitions, the nodal ones correspond exactly to the critical\npoints of an analogous functional, with the nodal deficiency being equal to the\nMorse index at this point.

Either the additional water is absorbed on the\nsurface of the silica particles and outside the pores, or else the pores are\nlarger than the traditional estimates. In addition the low Q Bragg intensities\nfrom a sample of MCM-41-S15 porous silica under different dry and wet\nconditions and with different hydrogen isotopes are simulated using a simple\nmodel of the water and silica density profile across the pore.

Rev. Lett. 106, 090504 (2011)]. In the case of optical\nmemories, such as CDs and DVDs, this discrimination involves lossy bosonic\nchannels and can be remarkably boosted by the use of nonclassical light\n(quantum reading). Here we generalize these concepts by extending the model of\nmemory from single-cell to multi-cell encoding. In general, information is\nstored in a block of cells by using a channel-codeword, i.e., a sequence of\nchannels chosen according to a classical code. Correspondingly, the readout of\ndata is realized by a process of \"parallel\" channel discrimination, where the\nentire block of cells is probed simultaneously and decoded via an optimal\ncollective measurement. In the limit of an infinite block we define the quantum\nreading capacity of the memory, quantifying the maximum number of readable bits\nper cell. This notion of capacity is nontrivial when we suitably constrain the\nphysical resources of the decoder. For optical memories (encoding bosonic\nchannels), such a constraint is energetic and corresponds to fixing the mean\ntotal number of photons per cell.

In this paper devoted to\nvacuum nano-junctions, we compare the Simmons results for $V_t$ with those\nobtained from the exact Schrodinger equation by exactly including the classical\nimage effects. The comparison reveals that the Simmons estimates for $V_t$ are\ncompletely unacceptable for nanogap sizes ($d$) at which image effects are\nimportant. The Simmons treatment drastically overestimates these effects,\nbecause it misses the famous 1/2 factor related to the fact that the image\ninteraction energy is a self energy. The maximum of the Simmons curve $V_t$ vs.\n$d$ turns out to be merely an artefact of an inappropriate approximation.\nUnlike the Simmons approach, the \"exact\" WKB method yields results, which\nqualitatively agree with the exact ones; quantitative differences are\nimportant, demonstrating that the transmission prefactor has a significant\nimpact on $V_t$. Further, we show that a difference between the work functions\nof the left and right electrodes, which gives rise to a Volta field, may be\nimportant for the ubiquitous asymmetry of the measured $I$-$V$-characteristics\nin general, and for the different $V_t$-values at positive and negative biases\nreported in vacuum nanojunctions in particular. The weak dependence $V_t =\nV_t(d)$ found experimentally in vacuum nanojunctions contrasts to the\npronounced dependence obtained by including the exact electrostatic image\ncontribution into the Schrodinger equation. This demonstrates that not only the\nmolecular transport, but also the transport through a vacuum nanogap represents\na nontrivial problem, which requires further refinements, e.g., a realistic\ndescription of contacts' geometry, retardation effects due to the finite\ntunneling time, local phonons, surface plasmons or electron image states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 17:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

The sharpness of these transitions has been taken as\nevidence against free precession as the mechanism behind the long term\nvariations. We argue that such a conclusion is premature. By performing a\nsimple best-fit analysis to the data, we show that the relationship between the\nobserved spin and modulation periods is of approximately the correct form to be\naccounted for by the free precession of a population of neutron stars with\nstrained crusts, the level of strain being similar in all of the stars, and\nconsistent with the star retaining a memory of a former faster rotation rate.\nWe also provide an argument as to why abrupt magnetospheric changes can occur\nin precessing stars, and how such changes would serve to magnify the effect of\nprecession in the timing data, making the observation of the precession more\nlikely in those stars where such switching occurs.

While in the\npresence of a variable sound speed there are many more scenarios which are\nscale invariant at the level of the two-point function, they generically suffer\nfrom strong coupling problems similar to those in the canonical case. There is,\nhowever, an exceptional case with superluminal sound speed, which suppresses\nnon-gaussianities and somewhat alleviates strong coupling issues. We focus on a\nparticular realization of this limit and show these scenarios are constrained\nand only able to produce at most 28 e-folds of scale invariant and gaussian\nperturbations. A similar bound should hold more generally --- the condition\nresults from the combined requirements of matching the observed amplitude of\ncurvature perturbations, demanding that the Hubble parameter remain\nsub-Planckian and keeping non-gaussianities under control.

Assuming that the CII luminosity is proportional to\nthe carbon mass in dark matter halos, we also compute the power spectrum of the\nCII line intensity at various redshifts. In order to avoid the contamination\nfrom CO rotational lines at low redshift when targeting a CII survey at high\nredshifts, we propose the cross-correlation of CII and 21-cm line emission from\nhigh redshifts. To explore the detectability of the CII signal from\nreionization, we also evaluate the expected errors on the CII power spectrum\nand CII-21 cm cross power spectrum based on the design of the future milimeter\nsurveys. We note that the CII-21 cm cross power spectrum contains interesting\nfeatures that captures physics during reionization, including the ionized\nbubble sizes and the mean ionization fraction, which are challenging to measure\nfrom 21-cm data alone. We propose an instrumental concept for the reionization\nCII experiment targeting the frequency range of $\\sim$ 200 to 300 GHz with 1, 3\nand 10 meter apertures and a bolometric spectrometer array with 64 independent\nspectral pixels with about 20,000 bolometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 23:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We use the\ndiscrete-basis Hill-Wheel method (HW) to compute the wave functions with an\ninteraction from the Gogny family of Hamiltonians. Comparing to the compiled\nexperimental data on octupole excitations, we find that the performance of the\ntheory depends on the deformation characteristics of the nucleus. For\nnondeformed nuclei, the theory reproduces the energies to about 20 % apart from\nan overall scale factor of about 1.6. The performance is somewhat poorer for\n(quadrupole) deformed nuclei, and for both together the dispersion of the\nscaled energies about the experimental values is about 25 %.

While one of them was clearly caused by stellar activity from the\nsecondary late-type main-sequence star, our analysis indicated that the white\ndwarf primary star is potentially the origin of the second component. However,\nthe low resolution of the data means that our interpretation remains ambiguous.\nWe here use time-series UVES data to compare the radial velocities of the\nHalpha emission components to those of metal absorption lines from the primary\nand secondary stars. We find that the weaker component most certainly\noriginates in the white dwarf and is probably caused by accretion. An abundance\nanalysis of the white dwarf spectrum yields accretion rates that are consistent\nwith mass loss from the secondary due to a stellar wind. The second and\nstronger Halpha component is attributed to stellar activity on the secondary\nstar. An active secondary is likely to be present because of the occurrence of\na flare in our time-resolved spectroscopy. Furthermore, Roche tomography\nindicates that a significant area of the secondary star on its leading side and\nclose to the first Lagrange point is covered by star spots. Finally, we derive\nthe parameters for the system and place it in an evolutionary context.

Moreover, the queries and the schemas have to continually\n\\textit{evolve} to address business requirements. During such repetitive\ntransitions, the \\textit{order} of index deployment has to be considered while\ndesigning the physical schemas such as indexes and MVs.\n  An effective index deployment ordering can produce (1) a prompt query runtime\nimprovement and (2) a reduced total deployment time. Both of these are\nessential qualities of design tools for quickly evolving databases, but\noptimizing the problem is challenging because of complex index interactions and\na factorial number of possible solutions.\n  We formulate the problem in a mathematical model and study several techniques\nfor solving the index ordering problem. We demonstrate that Constraint\nProgramming (CP) is a more flexible and efficient platform to solve the problem\nthan other methods such as mixed integer programming and A* search. In addition\nto exact search techniques, we also studied local search algorithms to find\nnear optimal solution very quickly.\n  Our empirical analysis on the TPC-H dataset shows that our pruning techniques\ncan reduce the size of the search space by tens of orders of magnitude.

This will lead to an\nartificial energy flux from the low-frequency (large scale) to the\nhigh-frequency (small scale) part. Thus the power law, if it exists, is\ncontaminated.

The dense\ncores are identified in the simulated density data cube through a clumpfind\nalgorithm. We find that the core velocity dispersion does not show any clear\ndependence on the core size, in contrast to Larson's linewidth-size relation,\nbut consistent with recent observations. In the absence of a magnetic field,\nthe majority of the cores have supersonic velocity dispersions. A\nmoderately-strong magnetic field reduces the dispersion to a subsonic or at\nmost transonic value typically. Most of the cores are out of virial\nequilibrium, with the external pressure dominating the self-gravity. The\nimplication is that the core evolution is largely controlled by the\noutflow-driven turbulence. Even an initially-weak magnetic field can retard\nstar formation significantly, because the field is amplified by the\noutflow-driven turbulence to an equipartition strength, with the distorted\nfield component dominating the uniform one. In contrast, for a\nmoderately-strong field, the uniform component remains dominant. Such a\ndifference in the magnetic structure is evident in our simulated polarization\nmaps of dust thermal emission; it provides a handle on the field strength.\nRecent polarization measurements show that the field lines in cluster-forming\nclumps are spatially well-ordered. It is indicative of a moderately-strong,\ndynamically important, field which, in combination with outflow feedback, can\nkeep the rate of star formation in embedded clusters at the\nobservationally-inferred, relatively-slow rate of several percent per free-fall\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 02:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In\nthis paper, an equation of metallicity governed by SNexp and radial advection\nis established to describe the metal distribution and evolution in the SF disk.\nWe find that the metal abundance is enriched at different rates at different\npositions in the disk, and that a metallicity gradient is set up that evolves\nfor steady-state AGNs. Metallicity as an integrated physical parameter can be\nused as a probe of the SF disk age during one episode of SMBH activity. In the\nSF disk, evaporation of molecular clouds heated by SNexp blast waves\nunavoidably forms hot gas.

Our goal is to understand the crossover from\nBCS superfluidity in the weak attraction limit to the BEC of molecules in the\nstrong attraction limit, with particular emphasis on how this crossover in an\noptical lattice differs from the much better studied continuum problem. We use\na large-$N$ theory with Sp(2N) symmetry to study the fluctuations beyond mean\nfield theory. At T=0, we calculate across the crossover various observables,\nincluding chemical potential, gap, ground state energy, speed of sound and\ncompressibility. The superfluid density $n_s$ is found to have non-trivial\n$U/t$ dependence in this lattice system. We show that the transition\ntemperature $T_c$ scales with the energy gap in the weak coupling limit but\ncrosses over to a $t^2/U$ scaling in the BEC limit, where phase fluctuations\ncontrolled by $n_s$ determine $T_c$. We also find, quite contrary to our\nexpectations, that in the strong coupling limit, the large-$N$ theory gives\nqualitatively wrong trends for compressibility. A comparison with a simple\nHartree shifted BCS theory, which takes into account both pairing and Hartree\nshifts, and correctly recovers the atomic limit and the right qualitative trend\nfor compressibility, reveals that the large-$N$ theory on the lattice, although\nconsiders a larger number of diagrams, is in fact inferior to the simpler\nHartree shifted BCS theory. The failure of the large-$N$ approach is explained\nby noting (i) the importance of Hartree shift in lattice problems, and (ii)\ninability of the large-$N$ approach to treat particle-particle and\nparticle-hole channels at equal footing at the saddle point level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 05:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-20"}

This\nfundamental goal can be achieved with a mission concept such as NEAT - the\nNearby Earth Astrometric Telescope. NEAT is designed to carry out space-borne\nextremely-high-precision astrometric measurements sufficient to detect\ndynamical effects due to orbiting planets of mass even lower than Earth's\naround the nearest stars. Such a survey mission would provide the actual\nplanetary masses and the full orbital geometry for all the components of the\ndetected planetary systems down to the Earth-mass limit. The NEAT performance\nlimits can be achieved by carrying out differential astrometry between the\ntargets and a set of suitable reference stars in the field. The NEAT instrument\ndesign consists of an off-axis parabola single-mirror telescope, a detector\nwith a large field of view made of small movable CCDs located around a fixed\ncentral CCD, and an interferometric calibration system originating from\nmetrology fibers located at the primary mirror.

Assuming the existence of gap in the spectrum, this\nduality allows to obtain a precise formula for the asymptotic growth of the\nnumber of states with a fixed energy which depends on z and the energy of the\nground state, and reduces to the Cardy formula for z=1. The holographic\nrealization of the duality can be naturally inferred from the fact that\nEuclidean Lifshitz spaces in three dimensions with dynamical exponents and\ncharacteristic lengths given by z, l, and 1/z, l/z, respectively, are\ndiffeomorphic.

Here we focus on the observational properties of\nthe models in the X-ray band (nuclear luminosity; hot ISM luminosity and\ntemperature; temperature and brightness profiles during quiescence and during\noutbursts). The nuclear bursts last for ~10^7 yr, with a duty-cycle of a few X\n(10^-3-10^-2); the present epoch bolometric nuclear emission is very\nsub-Eddington. The ISM thermal luminosity \\lx oscillates in phase with the\nnuclear one; this helps reproduce statistically the observed large \\lx\nvariation. In quiescence the temperature profile has a negative gradient;\nthanks to past outbursts, the brightness profile lacks the steep shape typical\nof inflowing models. Outbursts produce disturbances in these profiles. Most\nsignificantly, a hot bubble from shocked hot gas is inflated at the galaxy\ncenter; the bubble would be conical in shape, and show radio emission. The ISM\nresumes a smooth appearance on a time-scale of ~200 Myr; the duty-cycle of\nperturbances in the ISM is of the order of 5-10%.

Current decision fusion schemes are based on binary\nvalued decision and do not consider bursty contextcapture. However, bursty\ncontext and multi-valued data are important characteristics of WSNs. One on\nhand, the local decisions from sensors usually have bursty and contextual\ncharacteristics. Fusion center must capture the bursty context information from\nthe sensors. On the other hand, in practice, many applications need to process\nmulti-valued data, such as temperature and reflection level used for lightening\nprediction. To address these challenges, the Markov modulated Poisson process\n(MMPP) and multi-valued logic are introduced into WSNs to perform\ncontext-capture multi-valued decision fusion. The overall decision fusion is\ndecomposed into two parts. The first part is the context-capture model for WSNs\nusing superposition MMPP. Through this procedure, the fusion center has a\nhigher probability to get useful local decisions from sensors. The second one\nis focused on multi-valued decision fusion. Fault detection can also be\nperformed based on MVL. Once the fusion center detects the faulty nodes, all\ntheir local decisions are removed from the computation of the likelihood\nratios. Finally, we evaluate the capability of context-capture and fault\ntolerant. The result supports the usefulness of our scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 10:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-20"}

We obtained\noptical spectra of the nuclei of 177 galaxies using the 1.5m Cassini telescope,\nwhich are added to the 4785 spectra available from SDSS (DR7) to fill-in the\nincomplete coverage by SDSS of luminous galaxies. We perform a spectral\nclassification of the nuclei of galaxies (with a completeness of 98% at\nr<17.77), classifying the nuclear spectra in six classes: three of them (SEY,\nsAGN, LIN) refer to AGNs and the remaining three (HII, RET, PAS) refer to\ndifferent stages of starburst activity.

Based on a result of Fortnow and Santhanam (JCSS\n2011), Bodlaender et al. (JCSS 2009) showed that, unless NP \\subseteq\ncoNP/poly, the existence of a deterministic polynomial-time composition\nalgorithm, i.e., an algorithm which outputs an instance of bounded parameter\nvalue which is yes if and only if one of t input instances is yes, rules out\nthe existence of polynomial kernels for a problem. Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC\n2010) continued this line of research and, amongst others, were able to rule\nout kernels of size O(k^d-eps) for certain problems, assuming NP !\\subseteq\ncoNP/poly. Their work implies that even the existence of a co-nondeterministic\ncomposition rules out polynomial kernels.\n  In this work we present the first example of how co-nondeterminism can help\nto make a composition algorithm. We study a Ramsey-type problem: Given a graph\nG and an integer k, the question is whether G contains an independent set or a\nclique of size at least k. It was asked by Rod Downey whether this problem\nadmits a polynomial kernelization. We provide a co-nondeterministic composition\nbased on embedding t instances into a single host graph H. The crux is that the\nhost graph H needs to observe a bound of L \\in O(log t) on both its maximum\nindependent set and maximum clique size, while also having a cover of its\nvertex set by independent sets and cliques all of size L; the\nco-nondeterministic composition is build around the search for such graphs.\nThus we show that, unless NP \\subseteq coNP/poly, the problem does not admit a\nkernelization with polynomial size guarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 12:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 13:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

It is inherently\ncentralized. However, with the increasing number of processors, the cost for\nmanaging a single centralized list becomes too prohibitive. A suitable approach\nto reduce the contention is to distribute the list among the computational\nunits: each processor has only a local view of the work to execute. Thus, the\nscheduler is no longer greedy and standard performance guarantees are lost.\n  The objective of this work is to study the extra cost that must be paid when\nthe list is distributed among the computational units. We first present a\ngeneral methodology for computing the expected makespan based on the analysis\nof an adequate potential function which represents the load unbalance between\nthe local lists. We obtain an equation on the evolution of the potential by\ncomputing its expected decrease in one step of the schedule. Our main theorem\nshows how to solve such equations to bound the makespan. Then, we apply this\nmethod to several scheduling problems, namely, for unit independent tasks, for\nweighted independent tasks and for tasks with precendence constraints. More\nprecisely, we prove that the time for scheduling a global workload W composed\nof independent unit tasks on m processors is equal to W/m plus an additional\nterm proportional to log_2 W. We provide a lower bound which shows that this is\noptimal up to a constant. This result is extended to the case of weighted\nindependent tasks. In the last setting, precedence task graphs, our analysis\nleads to an improvement on the bound of Arora et al. We finally provide some\nexperiments using a simulator. The distribution of the makespan is shown to fit\nexisting probability laws. The additive term is shown by simulation to be\naround 3 \\log_2 W confirming the tightness of our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 15:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-20"}

Nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open in\nthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the GRB environment. In\nparticular, GRB 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic halo\nenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and the\nnon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. In this work we collect all\npublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the NIR-to-X-ray\nspectral energy distribution (SED) and studying the high signal-to-noise\nVLT/FORS afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of GRB\nabsorbers. The SED reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the UV, low\nequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a LMC- or\nSMC-type extinction curve. From the weak MgII absorption at z=1.5477 in the\nspectrum, we derived logN(MgII)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ionic\ncolumn density of several metals. These suggest that the GRB absorber is most\nlikely an LLS with a 0.03Z\\odot<Z<1.3Z\\odot metallicity. The comparison with\nother GRB absorbers places GRB070125 at the low end of the absorption line\nequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features and\nspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.\nMoreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surrounding\nthe GRB, combined with a low N(HI) along a short segment of the line of sight\nwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in GRB070125.\nFinally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faint\nGRB host galaxy, well within the GRB host brightness distribution. Thus, the\npossibility that GRB070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,\nmassive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems more\nlikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 15:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In a previous\narticle we showed that the regular geometric limit set $\\Lim$ splits as a\nproduct $F_\\Gamma\\times P_\\Gamma$, where $F_\\Gamma\\subseteq\\rand_1\\times\n\\rand_2$ is the projection of the geometric limit set to $\\rand_1\\times\n\\rand_2$, and $P_\\Gamma$ encodes the ratios of the speed of divergence of orbit\npoints in each factor. Our aim in this paper is a description of the limit set\nfrom a measure theoretical point of view. We first study the conformal density\nobtained from the classical Patterson-Sullivan construction, then generalize\nthis construction to obtain measures supported in each $\\Gamma$-invariant\nsubset of the regular limit set and investigate their properties. Finally we\nshow that the Hausdorff dimension of the radial limit set in each\n$\\Gamma$-invariant subset of $\\Lim$ is bounded above by the exponential growth\nrate introduced in the previous article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 15:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-20"}

At\nhalf-filling it is found that half-metallic(HM) state can be achieved at an\nintermediate value of the ISB potential due to its competition with the\nelectron-electron interaction. Away from half-filling, the phase diagrams of\ndoping versus ISB potential for different ribbon width are given, where the\nregimes for the HM states and NC magnetic state are clearly indicated and\ndiscussed.

The probability densities as\nwell as average velocities of the packet center and the average spin components\nwere calculated analytically and visualized. Our computations demonstrate that\ndue to dephasing of the states for times larger than the cyclotron period the\ninitial wave packet (which includes the states with the positive energy only)\nloses the spatial localization so that the evolution can no longer be described\nclassically. However, at the half-revival time $t=T_R/2$ its reshaping takes\nplace firstly. The behavior of the wave packet containing the states of both\nenergy bands (with $E_n>0$ and $E_n<0$) is more complicated. At short times of\na few classical periods such packet splits into two parts which rotate with\ncyclotron frequency in the opposite directions and meet each other every\none-half of the cyclotron period. At these moments their wave functions have\nsignificant overlap that leads to ZB. At the time of fractional revival each of\ntwo sub-packets is decomposed into few packets-fractions. However, at $t=T_R$\neach of the two sub-packets (with positive or negative energy) restores at\nvarious points of the cyclotron orbit, that makes it impossible reshaping of\ninitial wave packet entirely unlike the wave packet which consists of states\nwith energies $E_n>0$ only.
