The introduction of the conformal method in the 1970's as a\nparameterization of initial data for the Einstein equations led to increased\ninterest in the development of a complete solution theory for the constraints,\nwith the theory for constant mean curvature (CMC) spatial slices and closed\nmanifolds completely developed by 1995. The first general non-CMC existence\nresult was establish by Holst et al. in 2008, with extensions to rough data by\nHolst et al. in 2009, and to vacuum spacetimes by Maxwell in 2009. The non-CMC\ntheory remains mostly open; moreover, recent work of Maxwell on specific\nsymmetry models sheds light on fundamental non-uniqueness problems with the\nconformal method as a parameterization in non-CMC settings. In parallel with\nthese mathematical developments, computational physicists have uncovered\nsurprising behavior in numerical solutions to the extended conformal thin\nsandwich formulation of the Einstein constraints. In particular, numerical\nevidence suggests the existence of multiple solutions with a quadratic fold,\nand a recent analysis of a simplified model supports this conclusion. In this\narticle, we examine this apparent bifurcation phenomena in a methodical way,\nusing modern techniques in bifurcation theory and in numerical homotopy\nmethods. We first review the evidence for the presence of bifurcation in the\nHamiltonian constraint in the time-symmetric case. We give a brief introduction\nto the mathematical framework for analyzing bifurcation phenomena, and then\ndevelop the main ideas behind the construction of numerical homotopy, or\npath-following, methods in the analysis of bifurcation phenomena. We then apply\nthe continuation software package AUTO to this problem, and verify the presence\nof the fold with homotopy-based numerical methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 16:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 06:55:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 17:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We analyse the CoRoT data\ncorresponding to three hot O-type stars, describing the properties of their\nlight curves and we search for pulsational frequencies, which we then compare\nto theoretical model predictions. We determine the amplitude spectrum of the\ndata, using the Lomb-Scargle and a multifrequency HMM-like technique.\nFrequencies are extracted by prewhitening, and their significance is evaluated\nunder the assumption that the light curve is dominated by red noise. We search\nfor harmonics, linear combinations and regular spacings among these\nfrequencies. We use simulations with the same time sampling as the data as a\npowerful tool to judge the significance of our results. From the theoretical\npoint of view, we use the MAD non-adiabatic pulsation code to determine the\nexpected frequencies of excited modes. A substantial number of frequencies is\nlisted, but none can be convincingly identified as being connected to\npulsations. The amplitude spectrum is dominated by red noise. Theoretical\nmodelling shows that all three O-type stars can have excited modes but the\nrelation between the theoretical frequencies and the observed spectrum is not\nobvious. The dominant red noise component in the hot O-type stars studied here\nclearly points to a different origin than the pulsations seen in cooler O\nstars. The physical cause of this red noise is unclear, but we speculate on the\npossibility of sub-surface convection, granulation, or stellar wind\ninhomogeneities being responsible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 16:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A challenge all these approaches\nhave to address is to allow for simulations at cell-biologically relevant\ntimescales without neither neglecting important spatial and biochemical\nproperties of the simulated system nor introducing ad-hoc assumptions not based\non physical principles. Here we describe a PSSA that permits large time steps\nwhile still retaining a high degree of accuracy. The approach addresses the\ntypical disadvantage of Brownian dynamics, namely the need to use small time\nsteps to resolve bimolecular encounters accurately, by estimating the number of\notherwise unnoticed encounters with the help of the Green's functions of the\ndiffusion equation incorporating molecular interactions. This method has\npreviously been proposed for purely absorbing boundary conditions and\nirreversible bimolecular reactions. Building on those ideas, we developed a\ngeneral-purpose PSSA that is applicable to a broad class of reaction-diffusion\nproblems by incorporating reflective and radiation boundary conditions and\nreversible reactions. We furthermore discuss how reaction-diffusion systems on\n2D membranes can be described and derive small time expansions of the Green's\nfunctions that substantially speed up key calculations, particularly in the\nproblematic case of molecules in close proximity. Finally, we point out the\nformal relationship between our and exact algorithms.

The layer is discretized into a triangular\nlattice of springs. The drying process is captured by reducing the natural\nlength of all springs by the same factor, and the amount of quenched disorder\nis controlled by varying the width {\\xi} of the distribution of the random\nbreaking thresholds for the springs. Once a spring breaks, redistribution of\nthe load may trigger an avalanche of breaks. Our simulations revealed that the\nsystem exhibits a phase transition with the amount of disorder as control\nparameter: at low disorders, the breaking process is dominated by a macroscopic\ncrack at the beginning, and the size distribution of the subsequent breaking\navalanches shows an exponential form. At high disorders, the fracturing\nproceeds in small-sized avalanches with an exponential distribution, generating\na large number of micro-cracks which eventually merge and break the layer.\nBetween both phases a sharp transition occurs at a critical amount of disorder\n{\\xi}_c = 0.40 \\pm 0.01, where the avalanche size distribution becomes a power\nlaw with exponent {\\tau} = 2.6 \\pm 0.08, in agreement with the mean-field value\n{\\tau} = 5/2 of the fiber bundle model.

Our sample comprises roughly 640000\ngalaxies at z~0.1, 130000 galaxies at z~1, and 36000 galaxies at z~2.\nStructural measurements for all but the z~0.1 galaxies were based on HST\nimaging, and SFRs are derived using a Herschel-calibrated ladder of SFR\nindicators. We find that a correlation between the structure and stellar\npopulation of galaxies (i.e., a 'Hubble sequence') is already in place since at\nleast z~2.5. At all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequence\nare well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescent\ngalaxies are better described by de Vaucouleurs profiles. In the upper envelope\nof the main sequence, the relation between the SFR and Sersic index reverses,\nsuggesting a rapid build-up of the central mass concentration in these\nstarbursting outliers. We observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-forming\nsystems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. At each\nmass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. The\nrate of size growth correlates with specific SFR, and so does \\Sigma_SFR at\neach redshift. A simple model using an empirically determined SF law and\nmetallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and stars\nis able to relate the observed \\Sigma_SFR and SFR_IR/SFR_UV, provided a more\npatchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 22:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We present a first\ngeneral characterization of the pulsational behaviour of A-F type stars as\nobserved in the Kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate A-F type\nstars. We propose three main groups to describe the observed variety in\npulsating A-F type stars: gamma Dor, delta Sct, and hybrid stars. We assign 63%\nof our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part as\nrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectral\ntype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171\nstars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has been\nobserved before. We characterize for the first time a large number of A-F type\nstars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,\nand typical pulsation amplitudes. The majority of hybrid stars show frequencies\nwith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma Dor and delta Sct range, also\nbetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. We find\nindications for the existence of delta Sct and gamma Dor stars beyond the edges\nof the current observational instability strips. The hybrid stars occupy the\nentire region within the delta Sct and gamma Dor instability strips, and\nbeyond. Non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. The\nlocation of gamma Dor and delta Sct classes in the (Teff,logg)-diagram has been\nextended. We investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and\n'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma Dor and delta Sct\nstars. Our results suggest a revision of the current observational instability\nstrips, and imply an investigation of other pulsation mechanisms to supplement\nthe kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 20:54:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 17:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-21"}

In order to build a\nphenomenologically viable model, on top of the two moduli corresponding to the\nbase and the K3 fibre, we demand also the existence of two additional rigid\ndivisors: the first supporting the non-perturbative effects needed to achieve\nmoduli stabilisation, and the second allowing the presence of chiral matter on\nwrapped D-branes.

Every receiver has some side information on x\nconsisting of a subset of the characters of x. The side information of the\nreceivers is represented by a graph G on n vertices in which {i,j} is an edge\nif R_i knows x_j. In the index coding problem the goal is to encode x using a\nminimum number of characters in F in a way that enables every R_i to retrieve\nthe ith character x_i using the encoded message and the side information. An\nindex code is linear if the encoding is linear, and in this case the minimum\npossible length is known to be equal to a graph parameter called minrank\n(Bar-Yossef et al., FOCS'06). Several bounds on the minimum length of an index\ncode for side information graphs G were shown in the study of index coding.\nHowever, the minimum length of an index code for the random graph G(n,p) is far\nfrom being understood. In this paper we initiate the study of the typical\nminimum length of a linear index code for G(n,p) over a field F. First, we\nprove that for every constant size field F and a constant p, the minimum length\nof a linear index code for G(n,p) over F is almost surely Omega(\\sqrt{n}).\nSecond, we introduce and study the following two restricted models of index\ncoding: 1. A locally decodable index code is an index code in which the\nreceivers are allowed to query at most q characters from the encoded message.\n2. A low density index code is a linear index code in which every character of\nthe word x affects at most q characters in the encoded message. Equivalently,\nit is a linear code whose generator matrix has at most q nonzero entries in\neach row.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2011 15:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
