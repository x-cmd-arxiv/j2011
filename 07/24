It should be a new\napproach the author has created proposing to obtain a general and unifying\napproach to logic and a faithful model of human mathematical deductive process.\nIn first-order logic there exist two different concepts of term and formula, in\nplace of these two concepts in our approach we have just one notion of\nexpression. In our system the set-builder notation is an expression-building\npattern. In our system we can easily express second-order, third order and\nany-order conditions. The meaning of a sentence will depend solely on the\nmeaning of the symbols it contains, it will not depend on external\n'structures'. Our deductive system is based on a very simple definition of\nproof and provides a good model of human mathematical deductive process. The\nsoundness and consistency of the system are proved. We discuss on the\ncompleteness of our deductive systems. We also discuss how our system relates\nto the most know types of paradoxes, from the discussion no specific\nvulnerability to paradoxes comes out.

A general transmission scheme for any\nmemoryless, single-hop, k-user channel with or without common information, is\ndefined through two steps. The first step is user virtualization: each user is\ndivided into multiple virtual sub-users according to a chosen rate-splitting\nstrategy which preserves the rates of the original messages. This results in an\nenhanced channel with a possibly larger number of users for which more coding\npossibilities are available. Moreover, user virtualization provides a simple\nmechanism to encode common messages to any subset of users. Following user\nvirtualization, the message of each user in the enhanced model is coded using a\nchosen combination of coded time-sharing, superposition coding and joint\nbinning. A graph is used to represent the chosen coding strategies: nodes in\nthe graph represent codewords while edges represent coding operations. This\ngraph is used to construct a graphical Markov model which illustrates the\nstatistical dependency among codewords that can be introduced by the\nsuperposition coding or joint binning. Using this statistical representation of\nthe overall codebook distribution, the error probability of the code is shown\nto vanish via a unified analysis. The rate bounds that define the achievable\nrate region are obtained by linking the error analysis to the properties of the\ngraphical Markov model. This proposed framework makes it possible to\nnumerically obtain an achievable rate region by specifying a user\nvirtualization strategy and describing a set of coding operations. The largest\nachievable rate region can be obtained by considering all the possible\nrate-splitting strategies and taking the union over all the possible ways to\nsuperimpose or bin codewords.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2011 18:45:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2012 12:20:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2015 14:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We focus on the long time saturation value\nof the return probability, $P_\\infty$. Because of the valley degree of freedom,\nthe analysis is more complex than in, for example, GaAs quantum dots, which\nhave two distinct $P_\\infty$ values depending on the magnetic field. Here the\nprepared state and the measured state is non-unique because two electrons in\nthe same dot are allowed in six different states.

The return probability experiment is found to be strongly\ndependent on the prepared state, on the external magnetic field---both Zeeman\nand orbital effects - and on the spin-orbit splitting.

The problem concerning\nsingularity of the effective potential for the Higgs field on the horizon of a\nblack hole, which was reported earlier, is resolved. The equations\ncharacterizing the properties of the vacuum state are derived and solved in a\ncertain approximation for the Schwarzschild black hole. The gravitational\nmass-shift effect is completely described in this case. The masses of the\nmassive particles in the standard model are shown to depend on the value of the\nHiggs boson mass in the flat spacetime. If the Higgs boson mass in the flat\nspacetime is less than 263.6 GeV, then the mass of any massive particle\napproaching a gravitating object grows. If the Higgs boson mass in the flat\nspacetime is greater than or equal to 278.2 GeV, the masses of all the massive\nparticles decrease in a strong gravitational field. The Higgs boson masses\nlying in between these two values prove to lead to instability, at least at the\none-loop level, and so they are excluded. It turns out that the vacuum\npossesses the same properties as an ultrarelativistic fluid in a certain\napproximation. The expression for the pressure, the entropy and enthalpy\ndensities of this fluid are obtained. The sound speed in this fluid is also\nderived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2011 22:14:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2012 14:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}

In contrast to the use of a red-detuned Gaussian beam\nto couple the atoms, the blue-detuned hollow-beam can confine cold atoms to the\ndarkest regions of the beam thereby minimizing shifts in the internal states\nand making the guide highly robust to heating effects. This single optical beam\nis used as both a funnel and guide to maximize the number of atoms into the\nfiber. In the proposed experiment, Rb atoms are loaded into a magneto-optical\ntrap (MOT) above a vertically-oriented optical fiber. We observe a\ngravito-optical trapping effect for atoms with high orbital momentum around the\ntrap axis, which prevents atoms from coupling to the fiber: these atoms lack\nthe kinetic energy to escape the potential and are thus trapped in the laser\nfunnel indefinitely.

We\ngeneralize Zsid\\'o's notion of model such that object types may vary, yielding\na larger category, while preserving initiality of the syntax therein. Thus we\nobtain an extended initiality theorem for typed abstract syntax, in which\ntranslations between terms over different types can be specified via the\nassociated category-theoretic iteration operator as an initial morphism. Our\ndefinitions ensure that translations specified via initiality are type-safe,\ni.e. compatible with the typing in the source and target language in the\nobvious sense. Our main example is given via the propositions-as-types\nparadigm: we specify propositions and inference rules of classical and\nintuitionistic propositional logics through their respective typed signatures.\nAfterwards we use the category--theoretic iteration operator to specify a\ndouble negation translation from the former to the latter. A second example is\ngiven by the signature of PCF. For this particular case, we formalize the\ntheorem in the proof assistant Coq.

Isolating and detecting a single\nflying electron after propagation to perform quantum optics like experiments at\nthe single electron level is therefore a challenging task. Up to date, only few\nexperiments have been performed in a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas\nwhere the electron propagates almost ballistically. Flying electrons were\ndetected via the current generated by an ensemble of electrons and electron\ncorrelations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the\nexperimental realisation of high efficiency single electron source and single\nelectron detector for a quantum medium where a single electron is propagating\nisolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving\npotential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single\nelectron along the 1D-channel at a speed of 3\\mum/ns. When such a quantum\nchannel is placed between two quantum dots, a single electron can be\ntransported from one quantum dot to the other, which is several micrometres\napart, with a quantum efficiency of emission and detection of 96% and 92%,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a\ntimescale shorter than the coherence time T2* of GaAs spin qubits6.
