This well-known \"entropy concentration\" phenomenon underlies\nthe maximum entropy method.\n  Existing proofs of the concentration phenomenon are based on limits or\nasymptotics and unrealistically assume that constraints hold precisely,\nsupporting maximum entropy inference more in principle than in practice. We\npresent, for the first time, non-asymptotic, explicit lower bounds on $n$ for a\nnumber of variants of the concentration result to hold to any prescribed\naccuracies, with the constraints holding up to any specified tolerance, taking\ninto account the fact that allocations of discrete units can satisfy\nconstraints only approximately. Again unlike earlier results, we measure\nconcentration not by deviation from the maximum entropy value, but by the\n$\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ distances from the maximum entropy-achieving frequency\nvector.

Both tidal fluid flow and the epicyclic motion of a\nslightly eccentric orbit produce an RV signal at twice the orbital frequency.\nIf care is not taken, the tidally induced RV may, in some cases, be confused\nwith a finite orbital eccentricity. Indeed, WASP-18 b is reported to have an\neccentric orbit with small e=0.009 and pericenter longitude \\omega=-\\pi/2.\nWhereas such a close alignment of the orbit and line of sight to the observer\nrequires fine tuning, this phase in the RV signal is naturally explained by the\ntidal velocity signature of an e=0 orbit. Additionally, the equilibrium tide\nestimate for the amplitude is in rough agreement with the data. Thus the\nreported eccentricity for WASP-18 b is instead likely a signature of the\ntidally-induced RV in the stellar host. Measurement of both the orbital and\ntidal velocity for non-transiting planets may allow planet mass and inclination\nto be separately determined solely from radial velocity data.

Recently it has been reported that the intrinsic dispersion at constant\nmagnitude of the structural relations from early-type galaxies is a useful tool\nto study the universality of these structural relations, that is to say, to\nstudy whether the structural relations depend on luminosity, wavelength,\nredshift and/or environment. In this work we study the intrinsic dispersion of\nthe Faber-Jackson relation as function of the luminosity, mass and redshift.\n  Methods. We use a sample of approximately 90 000 early-type galaxies from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR7) spanning a magnitude range of 7 $mag$ in\nboth $g$ and $r$ filters. We calculate the intrinsic dispersion of the\nFaber-Jackson relation at approximately constant magnitude and compare this at\ndifferent luminosities, masses and redshifts.\n  Results.

In this paper, the dust-to-metals ratio in the Galaxy is\ndetermined using the photoelectric absorption of the X-ray afterglows of a\nsample of several hundred gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to determine the metal column\ndensity in combination with Galactic dust maps to determine the line-of-sight\ndust extinction through the Galaxy in the direction of the GRB. GRB afterglows\noften have large extragalactic soft X-ray absorptions and therefore the GRB\nsample's upper-bound will define the Galactic dust-to-metals relation. Using a\ntwo-dimensional two-sample KS test, we determine this upper-bound and so derive\nthe dust-to-metals ratio of the Galaxy.

We further show that the dust-to-gas ratio seems to be\ncorrelated with the total gas column density, and that this may be due to the\nmetallicity gradient observed toward the Galactic centre. Based on the\nnon-constant nature of the dust-to-gas ratio, we propose that the dust column\ndensity, at N_H = 2.2e21 cm^-2 A_V, represents a better proxy for the soft\nX-ray absorption column density than HI maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 17:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The convergence of\nthe LME in a locally Sobolev space follows as a direct application of the\ngeneral theory. The analysis shows that the convergence order is linear in h, a\nmeasure of the density of the point set. The analysis also shows how to\nparameterize the LME scheme for optimal convergence. Because of the convex\napproximation property of LME, its behavior near the boundary is singular and\nrequires additional analysis.

Interestingly, this hypothesis is subject only to\nmarginal experimental constraints, because of the new nuclear matrix elements.\nThis possibility is analyzed in the context of the Type I seesaw model,\nperforming also exploratory investigations of the implications for heavy\nneutrino mass spectra, rare decays of mesons as well as neutrino-decay search,\nLHC, and lepton flavor violation. The heavy sterile neutrinos can saturate the\nrate only when their masses are below some 10 TeV, but in this case, the\nsuppression of the light-neutrino masses has to be more than the ratio of the\nelectroweak scale and the heavy-neutrino scale; i.e., more suppressed than the\nnaive seesaw expectation. We classify the cases when this condition holds true\nin the minimal version of the seesaw model, showing its compatibility (1) with\nneutrinoless double beta rate being dominated by heavy neutrinos and (2) with\nany light neutrino mass spectra. The absence of excessive fine-tunings and the\nradiative stability of light neutrino mass matrices, together with a saturating\nsterile neutrino contribution, imply an upper bound on the heavy neutrino\nmasses of about 10 GeV.

Past barotropic calculations have shown that\nrapidly-rotating first cores evolve into `pre-stellar discs' with radii up to\n~100 AU that may last thousands of years before a stellar core forms. We\ninvestigate how the inclusion of a realistic equation of state and radiative\ntransfer alters this behaviour, finding that the qualitative behaviour is\nsimilar, but that the pre-stellar discs may last 1.5-3 times longer in the more\nrealistic calculations. The masses, radii, and lifetimes of the discs increase\nfor initial molecular cloud cores with faster rotation rates.

Fragmentation of these massive discs may also provide an effective\nroute to binary and multiple star formation, before radiative feedback from\naccretion onto the stellar core can inhibit fragmentation. Once collapse to\nform a stellar core occurs within the pre-stellar disc, the radiation\nhydrodynamical simulations produce qualitatively different behaviour from the\nbarotropic calculations due to the accretion energy released.

Two users\ncommunicate with one destination over a discrete memoryless channel using time\ndivision. Each transmission block is divided into 3 time slots with variable\ndurations: the destination is always in receive mode, while each user\nalternatively transmits and receives during the first 2 time slots, then both\ncooperate to send information during the last one. The paper proposes two\ndecode-forward based coding schemes, analyzes their rate regions, and also\nderives two outer bounds with rate constraints similar to the achievable\nregions. Both schemes requires no block Makovity, allowing the destination to\ndecode at the end of each block without any delay. In the first scheme, the\ncodewords in the third time slot are superimposed on the codewords of the first\ntwo, whereas in the second scheme, these codewords are independent. While the\nsecond scheme is simpler, the first scheme helps emphasize the importance of\njoint decoding over separate decoding among multiple time slots at the\ndestination. For the Gaussian channel, the two schemes with joint decoding are\nequivalent, as are the two outer bounds. For physically degraded Gaussian\nchannels, the proposed schemes achieve the capacity.

In particular, the Power-law\ndegree distribution has long been used to model the structure of online social\nnetworks, and is the basis for algorithms and heuristics in graph applications\nsuch as influence maximization and social search. Along with recent measurement\nresults, our interest in this topic was sparked by our own experimental results\non social graphs that deviated significantly from those predicted by a\nPower-law model. In this work, we seek a deeper understanding of these\ndeviations, and propose an alternative model with significant implications on\ngraph algorithms and applications. We start by quantifying this artifact using\na variety of real social graphs, and show that their structures cannot be\naccurately modeled using elementary distributions including the Power-law.\nInstead, we propose the Pareto-Lognormal (PLN) model, verify its\ngoodness-of-fit using graphical and statistical methods, and present an\nanalytical study of its asymptotical differences with the Power-law. To\ndemonstrate the quantitative benefits of the PLN model, we compare the results\nof three wide-ranging graph applications on real social graphs against those on\nsynthetic graphs generated using the PLN and Power-law models.

The tree is built in a \"top-down\"\nfashion by \"recursive coordinate bisection\" where on each tree level we split\nthe longest side of a cell through its centre of mass. This procedure continues\nuntil the average number of particles in the lowest tree level has dropped\nbelow a prescribed value. To calculate the forces on the particles in each\nlowest-level cell we split the gravitational interaction into a near- and a\nfar-field. Since our main intended applications are SPH simulations, we\ncalculate the near-field by a direct, kernel-smoothed summation, while the far\nfield is evaluated via a Cartesian Taylor expansion up to quadrupole order.\nInstead of applying the far-field approach for each particle separately, we use\nanother Taylor expansion around the centre of mass of each lowest-level cell to\ndetermine the forces at the particle positions. Due to this \"cell-cell\ninteraction\" the code performance is close to O(N) where N is the number of\nused particles. We describe in detail various technicalities that ensure a low\nmemory footprint and an efficient cache use.\n  In a set of benchmark tests we scrutinize our new tree and compare it to the\n\"Press tree\" that we have previously made ample use of. At a slightly higher\nforce accuracy than the Press tree, our tree turns out to be substantially\nfaster and increasingly more so for larger particle numbers. For four million\nparticles our tree build is faster by a factor of 25 and the time for neighbour\nsearch and gravity is reduced by more than a factor of 6. In single processor\ntests with up to 10^8 particles we confirm experimentally that the scaling\nbehaviour is close to O(N). The current Fortran 90 code version is\nOpenMP-parallel and scales excellently with the processor number (=24) of our\ntest machine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 23:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-24"}

In most models thick disks are thought to be a necessary consequence of\nthe disk formation and/or evolution of the galaxy. We present the results of a\nstudy of the thick disk properties in a sample of carefully selected edge-on\ngalaxies with types ranging from T=3 to T=8. We fitted one-dimensional\nluminosity profiles with physically motivated functions - the solutions of two\nstellar and one gaseous isothermal coupled disks in equilibrium - which are\nlikely to yield more accurate results than other functions used in previous\nstudies. The images used for the fits come from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar\nStructure in Galaxies (S4G). We found that thick disks are on average more\nmassive than previously reported, mostly due to the selected fitting function.\nTypically, the thin and the thick disk have similar masses. We also found that\nthick disks do not flare significantly within the observed range in\ngalactocentric radii and that the ratio of thick to thin disk scaleheights is\nhigher for galaxies of earlier types.\n  Our results tend to favor an in situ origin for most of the stars in the\nthick disk. In addition the thick disk may contain a significant amount of\nstars coming from satellites accreted after the initial build-up of the galaxy\nand an extra fraction of stars coming from the secular heating of the thin disk\nby its own overdensities.\n  Assigning thick disk light to the thin disk component may lead to an\nunderestimate of the overall stellar mass in galaxies, because of different\nmass to light ratios in the two disk components. On the basis of our new\nresults, we estimate that disk stellar masses are between 10% and 50% higher\nthan previously thought and we suggest that thick disks are a reservoir of\n\"local missing baryons\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2011 04:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 04:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 08:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Known bounds and conjectures\nare verified in experiments, and some new theoretical relations, bounds and\nconjectures are proposed. The Fractional Free Energy (FFE) functional is\nparameterized by a scalar parameter $\\gamma\\in[-1;1]$, where $\\gamma=-1$\ncorresponds to the BP limit and $\\gamma=1$ corresponds to the exclusion\nprinciple (but ignoring perfect matching constraints) Mean-Field (MF) limit.\nFFE shows monotonicity and continuity with respect to $\\gamma$. For every\nnon-negative matrix, we define its special value $\\gamma_*\\in[-1;0]$ to be the\n$\\gamma$ for which the minimum of the $\\gamma$-parameterized FFE functional is\nequal to the permanent of the matrix, where the lower and upper bounds of the\n$\\gamma$-interval corresponds to respective bounds for the permanent. Our\nexperimental analysis suggests that the distribution of $\\gamma_*$ varies for\ndifferent ensembles but $\\gamma_*$ always lies within the $[-1;-1/2]$ interval.\nMoreover, for all ensembles considered the behavior of $\\gamma_*$ is highly\ndistinctive, offering an emprirical practical guidance for estimating\npermanents of non-negative matrices via the FFE approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2011 12:55:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 23:20:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 May 2012 16:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2013 14:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

It is applied to 3C 273. First, we\nderive the time lags of radio emission relative to broad emission lines\nLy$\\alpha$ and C IV by the ZDCF method. The broad lines lag the 5, 8, 15, 22\nand 37 GHz emission. The measured lags $\\tau^{\\rm{uv}}_{\\rm{ob}}$ are of the\norder of years. For a given line, $\\tau^{\\rm{uv}}_{\\rm{ob}}$ decreases as the\nradio frequency increases. This trend results from the radiative cooling of\nrelativistic electrons. Both UV lines have a lag of\n$\\tau^{\\rm{uv}}_{\\rm{ob}}=-2.74^{+0.06}_{-0.25}$ yr relative to the 37 GHz\nemission. These results are consistent with those derived from the Balmer lines\nin Paper I. Second, we derive the time lags of the lines Ly$\\alpha$, CIV,\nH$\\gamma$, H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ relative to the 37 GHz emission by the FR/RSS\nMonte Carlo method. The measured lags are\n$\\tau_{\\rm{ob}}=-3.40^{+0.31}_{-0.05}$, $-3.40^{+0.41}_{-0.14}$,\n$-2.06^{+0.36}_{-0.92}$, $-3.40^{+1.15}_{-0.20}$ and $-3.56^{+0.35}_{-0.18}$ yr\nfor the lines Ly$\\alpha$, CIV, H$\\gamma$, H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$, respectively.\nThese estimated lags are consistent with those derived by the ZDCF method\nwithin the uncertainties.

These anomalous behaviors suggest that there is an\nelectronic phase transition in the Fermi surface around the optimal doping\nlevel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2011 15:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-02"}

In d+Au collisions, one accesses the\nphysics at large $x$, which yields important constraints for nuclear parton\ndistribution functions. In both d+Au and A+A collisions, coherent\nmultiple-scattering models of energy loss can be tested. In this contribution,\nwe present the current results from the PHENIX experiment on fully\nreconstructed jets and direct $\\gamma$-hadron correlations. Baseline\nmeasurements of jets in p+p collisions as well as their yield and correlation\nmodifications in d+Au and Cu+Cu will be given. From $\\gamma$-hadron\ncorrelations, we present the fragmentation function in p+p and Au+Au collisions\nand its modification in Au+Au to $z_T$ lower than what has previously been\nstudied. Implications of this data on our understanding of both cold and hot,\ndense nuclear matter created at RHIC are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2011 15:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}
