Motivated by\nthese observations and the recent theoretical developments in the study of\nprimordial vector fields, we develop the formalism necessary to extract\nstatistical anisotropy information from the three-point function of the CMB\ntemperature anisotropy. We employ a simplified vector field model and\nparametrize the bispectrum of curvature fluctuations in such a way that all the\ninformation about statistical anisotropy is encoded in some parameters\nlambda_{LM} (which measure the anisotropic to the isotropic bispectrum\namplitudes). For such a template bispectrum, we compute an optimal estimator\nfor lambda_{LM} and the expected signal-to-noise ratio. We estimate that, for\nf_{NL} ~ 30, an experiment like Planck can be sensitive to a ratio of the\nanisotropic to the isotropic amplitudes of the bispectrum as small as 10%. Our\nresults are complementary to the information coming from a power spectrum\nanalysis and particularly relevant for those models where statistical\nanisotropy turns out to be suppressed in the power spectrum but not negligible\nin the bispectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 16:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 16:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In D-brane models they are\nassociated to U(1) gauge symmetries that are either anomalous in four\ndimensions or exhibit a hidden higher dimensional anomaly. We discuss the\npossible signals of massive Z'-gauge bosons at hadron collider machines\n(Tevatron, LHC) in a minimal D-brane model consisting out of four stacks of\nD-branes. In this construction, there are two massive gauge bosons, which can\nbe naturally associated with baryon number B and B-L (L being lepton number).\nHere baryon number is always anomalous in four dimensions, whereas the presence\nof a four-dimensional B-L anomaly depends on the U(1)-charges of the right\nhanded neutrinos. In case B-L is anomaly free, a mass hierarchy between the two\nassociated Z'-gauge bosons can be explained. In our phenomenological discussion\nabout the possible discovery of massive Z'-gauge bosons, we take as a benchmark\nscenario the dijet plus W signal, recently observed by the CDF Collaboration at\nTevatron. It reveals an excess in the dijet mass range 150 GeV/c^2, 4.1\\sigma\nbeyond SM expectations. We show that in the context of low-mass string theory\nthis excess can be associated with the production and decay of a leptophobic\nZ', a singlet partner of SU(3) gluons coupled primarily to baryon number. Even\nif the CDF signal disappears, as indicated by the more recent D0 results, our\nanalysis can still serve as the basis for future experimental search for\nmassive Z'-gauge bosons in low string scale models.

The masers associated with the\nnortheastern interaction region between the supernova remnant and the +50km/s\nmolecular cloud show the highest level of variability. This can be explained\nwith the +50km/s molecular cloud being located behind the supernova remnant and\nwith a region of high OH absorbing column density along the line of sight.\nPossibly the supernova remnant provides additional turbulence to the gas in\nthis region, through which the maser emission must travel. The masers in the\nsouthern interaction region are located on the outermost edge of SgrAEast which\nline of sight is not covered by either absorbing OH gas or a supernova remnant,\nin agreement with the much lower variability level observed. Similarly, the\nmasers associated with the CND show little variability, consistent with them\narising through collisions between relatively large clumps of gas in the CND\nand no significant amount of turbulent gas along the line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 18:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Stars that are accreted in\nsubstructures and then stripped follow a completely different radial\ndistribution than the stripped DM: the stellar halo is much more centrally\nconcentrated than DM. In order to understand how the same physical process can\nlead to different z=0 radial profiles, we examined the potential at accretion\nof each stripped particle. We found that star particles sit at systematically\nhigher potentials than DM, making them harder to strip. We then searched for a\nthreshold in the potential of accreted particles \\phi_[th], above which DM\nparticles behave as star particles.

Nevertheless, the most likely models favor a positive\nluminosity-dependent bias for MgII and possibly for CIV, such that at fixed\ntrue BH mass, objects with higher-than-average luminosities have over-estimated\nFWHM-based virial masses. There is tentative evidence that downsizing also\nmanifests itself in the active BHMF, and the BH mass density in broad-line\nquasars contributes an insignificant amount to the total BH mass density at all\ntimes. Within our model uncertainties, we do not find a strong BH mass\ndependence of the mean Eddington ratio; but there is evidence that the mean\nEddington ratio (at fixed BH mass) increases with redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 20:21:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 15:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Intuitively, games that are \"close\" to a\npotential game should share similar properties. In this paper, we formalize and\ndevelop this idea by quantifying to what extent the dynamic features of\npotential games extend to \"near-potential\" games. We study convergence of three\ncommonly studied classes of adaptive dynamics: discrete-time better/best\nresponse, logit response, and discrete-time fictitious play dynamics. For\nbetter/best response dynamics, we focus on the evolution of the sequence of\npure strategy profiles and show that this sequence converges to a (pure)\napproximate equilibrium set, whose size is a function of the \"distance\" from a\nclose potential game. We then study logit response dynamics and provide a\ncharacterization of the stationary distribution of this update rule in terms of\nthe distance of the game from a close potential game and the corresponding\npotential function. We further show that the stochastically stable strategy\nprofiles are pure approximate equilibria. Finally, we turn attention to\nfictitious play, and establish that the sequence of empirical frequencies of\nplayer actions converges to a neighborhood of (mixed) equilibria of the game,\nwhere the size of the neighborhood increases with distance of the game to a\npotential game. Thus, our results suggest that games that are close to a\npotential game inherit the dynamical properties of potential games. Since a\nclose potential game to a given game can be found by solving a convex\noptimization problem, our approach also provides a systematic framework for\nstudying convergence behavior of adaptive learning dynamics in arbitrary finite\nstrategic form games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 21:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-25"}

The assimilation is performed using\ndual-Doppler radar observations obtained during the period of rapid\nintensification of Hurricane Guillermo. A unique aspect of Guillermo was that\nduring the period of radar observations strong convective bursts, attributable\nto wind shear, formed primarily within the eastern semicircle of the eyewall.\nTo reproduce this observed structure within a hurricane model, background wind\nshear of some magnitude must be specified; as well as turbulence and surface\nparameters appropriately specified so that the impact of the shear on the\nsimulated hurricane vortex can be realized.

In this work,\nwe explore modifications to the star formation (SF) law as an alternative\nsolution to achieve a match to the stellar mass function. This is done by\napplying semi-analytic models based on De Lucia & Blaizot, but with varying SF\nlaws, to the Millennium and Millennium-II simulations, within the formalism\ndeveloped by Neistein & Weinmann. Our best model includes lower SF efficiencies\nthan predicted by the Kennicutt-Schmidt law at low stellar masses, no sharp\nthreshold of cold gas mass for SF, and a SF law that is independent of cosmic\ntime. These simple modifications result in a model that is more successful than\ncurrent standard models in reproducing various properties of galaxies less\nmassive than 10^{10}Msun. The improvements include a good match to the observed\nauto-correlation function of galaxies, an evolution of the stellar mass\nfunction from z=3 to z=0 similar to observations, and a better agreement with\nobserved specific star formation rates. However, our modifications also lead to\na dramatic over-prediction of the cold mass content of galaxies.

A repulsion of the critical zeros of these L-functions\naway from the center of the critical strip was observed numerically by S. J.\nMiller in 2006; such behaviour deviates qualitatively from the conjectural\nlimiting distribution of the zeros (for large conductors this distribution is\nexpected to approach the one-level density of eigenvalues of orthogonal\nmatrices after appropriate rescaling).Our purpose here is to provide a random\nmatrix model for Miller's surprising discovery. We consider the family of even\nquadratic twists of a given elliptic curve. The main ingredient in our model is\na calculation of the eigenvalue distribution of random orthogonal matrices\nwhose characteristic polynomials are larger than some given value at the\nsymmetry point in the spectra. We call this sub-ensemble of SO(2N) the excised\northogonal ensemble. The sieving-off of matrices with small values of the\ncharacteristic polynomial is akin to the discretization of the central values\nof L-functions implied by the formula of Waldspurger and Kohnen-Zagier.The\ncut-off scale appropriate to modeling elliptic curve L-functions is\nexponentially small relative to the matrix size N. The one-level density of the\nexcised ensemble can be expressed in terms of that of the well-known Jacobi\nensemble, enabling the former to be explicitly calculated. It exhibits an\nexponentially small (on the scale of the mean spacing) hard gap determined by\nthe cut-off value, followed by soft repulsion on a much larger scale. Neither\nof these features is present in the one-level density of SO(2N). When N tends\nto infinity we recover the limiting orthogonal behaviour. Our results agree\nqualitatively with Miller's discrepancy. Choosing the cut-off appropriately\ngives a model in good quantitative agreement with the number-theoretical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 06:30:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 20:17:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 14:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Along lines of sight with density inhomogeneities which average\nout on scales less than the Hubble radius, we find the distance redshift\nrelation to diverge negligibly from the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\n(FLRW) result. On the contrary, if we observe along lines of sight which do not\nhave the same average density as the background, we find large deviations from\nthe FLRW distance redshift relation. Hence, a possibly large systematic might\nbe introduced into the analysis of cosmological observations, e.g. supernovae,\nif we observe along lines of sight which are typically more or less dense than\nthe average density of the Universe. In turn, this could lead to wrong\nparameter estimation: even if the Cosmological Principle is valid, the\nidentification of the true FLRW background in an inhomogeneous universe maybe\nmore difficult than usually assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 07:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 10:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

With DOS, stations contend for\nthe channel using random access; after a successful contention, they measure\nthe channel conditions and only transmit in case of a good channel, while\ngiving up the transmission opportunity when the channel conditions are poor.\nThe distributed nature of DOS systems makes them vulnerable to selfish users:\nby deviating from the protocol and using more transmission opportunities, a\nselfish user can gain a greater share of the wireless resources at the expense\nof the well-behaved users. In this paper, we address the selfishness problem in\nDOS from a game theoretic standpoint. We propose an algorithm that satisfies\nthe following properties: (i) when all stations implement the algorithm, the\nwireless network is driven to the optimal point of operation, and (ii) one or\nmore selfish stations cannot gain any profit by deviating from the algorithm.\nThe key idea of the algorithm is to react to a selfish station by using a more\naggressive configuration that (indirectly) punishes this station. We build on\nmultivariable control theory to design a mechanism for punishment that on the\none hand is sufficiently severe to prevent selfish behavior while on the other\nhand is light enough to guarantee that, in the absence of selfish behavior, the\nsystem is stable and converges to the optimum point of operation. We conduct a\ngame theoretic analysis based on repeated games to show the algorithm's\neffectiveness against selfish stations. These results are confirmed by\nextensive simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 08:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Several representations of max-stable random fields have\nbeen proposed in the literature.

We use two representations of stationary\nmax-stable spatial random fields and extend the concepts to the space-time\ndomain. In a first approach, we extend the idea of constructing max-stable\nrandom fields as limits of normalized and rescaled pointwise maxima of\nindependent Gaussian random fields, which was introduced by Kabluchko,\nSchlather and de Haan [2009], who construct max-stable random fields associated\nto a class of variograms. We use a similar approach based on a well-known\nresult by H\\\"usler and Reiss and apply specific spatio-temporal covariance\nmodels for the underlying Gaussian random field, which satisfy weak regularity\nassumptions. Furthermore, we extend Smith's storm profile model to a space-time\nsetting and provide explicit expressions for the bivariate distribution\nfunctions.\n  The tail dependence coefficient is an important measure of extremal\ndependence. We show how the spatio-temporal covariance function underlying the\nGaussian random field can be interpreted in terms of the tail dependence\ncoefficient. Within this context, we examine different concepts for\nconstructing spatio-temporal covariance models and analyse several specific\nexamples, including Gneiting's class of nonseparable stationary covariance\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 09:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-25"}

The O depletion\nobserved in some globular cluster giant stars, always associated with a Na\nenhancement, may be due to either a deep mixing during the RGB (red giant\nbranch) phase of the star or to the pollution of the primordial gas by an early\npopulation of massive AGB (asymptotic giant branch) stars, whose chemical\ncomposition was modified by the hot bottom burning. In both cases, the NO cycle\nis responsible for the O depletion. The activation of this cycle depends on the\nrate of the 15N(p,{\\gamma})16O reaction. A precise evaluation of this reaction\nrate at temperatures as low as experienced in H-burning zones in stellar\ninteriors is mandatory to understand the observed O abundances. We present a\nnew measurement of the 15N(p,{\\gamma})16O reaction performed at LUNA covering\nfor the first time the center of mass energy range 70-370 keV, which\ncorresponds to stellar temperatures between 65 {\\cdot} 106 K and 780 {\\cdot}106\nK.

With the\npresent data, we are also able to confirm the result of the previous R-matrix\nextrapolation. In particular, in the temperature range of astrophysical\ninterest, the new rate is about a factor of 2 smaller than reported in the\nwidely adopted compilation of reaction rates (NACRE or CF88) and the\nuncertainty is now reduced down to the 10% level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 13:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-20"}

For both distributions, a wide range of model parameters\nprovide an acceptable match to the observed sample, with the log-normal\nfunction providing statistically better agreement in general than the power-law\nmodels. Moreover, the power-law models predict a parent population size that is\na factor of between two and ten times higher than for the log-normal models.

Three main basic ingredients enter the\nproblem influencing the total dust budget and the mixture of the dust grains:\nthe types and amounts of dust injected by AGB stars and SNae and the\naccretion/destruction processes of dust in the ISM. They govern the relative\nabundances of the gas and dust in the ISM. In this study, we focus on star-dust\nand present a database of condensation efficiencies for the refractory elements\nC, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Fe in AGB stars and SNae that can be easily applied to\nthe gaseous ejecta, in order to determine the amount and kind of refractory\nelements locally embedded into dust and injected into the ISM. The best\ntheoretical recipes available nowadays in literature to estimate the amount of\ndust produced by SNae and AGB stars have been discussed and for SNae compared\nto the observations to get clues on the problem. The condensation efficiencies\nhave been analyzed in the context of a classical chemical model of dust\nformation and evolution in the Solar Neighbourhood and Galactic Disk.

A new generation of dust formation models\nin SNae is however required to solve some contradictions recently emerged. A\nsimple database of condensation efficiencies is set up to be used in chemical\nmodels including the effect of dust and meant to simulate galaxies going from\nprimordial proto-galaxies to those currently seen in the local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 15:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-25"}

Indeed, this usually requires finding specific elements in a group\nof symmetries that can be huge, and the problem of their very existence is\nNP-hard. We formulate such an existence problem as a constraint problem on one\nvariable (the symmetry to be used) ranging over a group, and try to find\nrestrictions that may be solved in polynomial time. By considering a simple\nform of constraints (restricted by a cardinality k) and the class of groups\nthat have the structure of Fp-vector spaces, we propose a partial algorithm\nbased on linear algebra. This polynomial algorithm always applies when k=p=2,\nbut may fail otherwise as we prove the problem to be NP-hard for all other\nvalues of k and p. Experiments show that this approach though restricted should\nallow for an efficient use of at least some groups of symmetries. We conclude\nwith a few directions to be explored to efficiently solve this problem on the\ngeneral case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 15:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-25"}

Our Mocassin model is composed of an extremely\ndense circumstellar disk and a large pair of diffuse bipolar lobes, a\ncombination necessary to reproduce the observed spectrum. The masses of these\ncomponents gives a total nebular mass of 4.7Mo. Discrepancies between our model\nfit and the observations are attributed to complex density inhomogeneities in\nthe nebula. The potential to resolve such discrepancies with more complex\nmodels is confirmed by a range of models introducing small-scale structures.\nCompared to solar abundances He is enhanced by 50%, C is slightly subsolar, O\nis solar, and N is enhanced by a factor of 6. These imply a significant 3rd\ndredge-up coupled with hot-bottom burning CN-cycle conversion of dredged-up C\nto N.\n  The central star is partly obscured by the edge-on circumstellar disk and its\nproperties are not well constrained. Emission from a number of high-ionization\n`coronal' lines provides constraints on the form of the high-energy ionizing\nflux. Using a solar abundance stellar atmosphere we are unable to fit all of\nthe observed line fluxes, but a substantially better fit was obtained using a\n220,000K H-deficient stellar atmosphere with L*=14,300 Lo. The H-deficient\nnature of the central star suggests it has undergone a late thermal pulse, and\nfits to evolutionary tracks imply a central star mass of 0.73-0.82Mo.\nTimescales for these tracks suggest the object left the top of the AGB ~2100\nyears ago, in agreement with studies of the recent mass-loss event that formed\nthe bipolar lobes. Based on the modelled nebular and central star masses we\nestimate the initial mass of the central star to be 5.5Mo, in agreement with\nthat derived from evolutionary tracks.\n  (Abstract truncated)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 15:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The\nLPSO structures are long-period stacking derivatives of the hcp-Mg structure,\nand the Zn/RE distributions are restricted at the four close-packed atomic\nlayers forming local fcc-stacking (i.e., a local ABCA stacking). Chemical order\nis well developed for the LPSO phases formed in Mg97Zn1Er2 (14H-type) and\nMg85Zn6Y9 (18R-type) alloys with pronounced superlattice reflections, and the\nrelevant Zn/RE distributions are clearly emerged in the Z-contrast atomic\nimages.

Further, by obtaining the more general two-soliton solutions\nusing this non-standard bilinearization approach we demonstrate that the\ncollision among coherently coupled soliton and incoherently coupled soliton\ndisplays a non-trivial collision behaviour in which the former always undergoes\nenergy switching accompanied by an amplitude dependent phase-shift and change\nin the relative separation distance, leaving the latter unaltered. But the\ncollision between coherently coupled solitons alone is found to be standard\nelastic collision. Our study also reveals the important fact that the collision\nbetween incoherently coupled solitons arising in the $m$-CCNLS system with\n$m=2$ is always elastic, whereas for $m>2$ the collision becomes intricate and\nfor this case the $m$-CCNLS system exhibits interesting energy sharing\ncollision of solitons characterized by intensity redistribution, amplitude\ndependent phase-shift and change in relative separation distance which is\nsimilar to that of the multicomponent Manakov soliton collisions. This suggests\nthat the $m$-CCNLS system can also be a suitable candidate for soliton\ncollision based optical computing in addition to the Manakov system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 05:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}

Cosmogenesis is a popular topic for speculation because it is\nphilosophically deep and because such speculations are unlikely to be proven\nwrong in the near future. The scenario we present here was intended mainly as a\npedagogical illustration or toy model, but it turns out to possibly have a more\nserious and interesting result - a rationale for the spatial flatness of the\nUniverse. Our basic assumptions are that the cosmological scale factor obeys\nthe standard Friedman equation of general relativistic cosmology and that the\nequation is dominated by a cosmological constant term and a curvature term; the\ndynamics of the Universe is then (approximately) the same as that of a tipping\npencil. The scale factor cannot remain at an unstable initial value of zero and\nmust increase (i.e. the Universe must come into existence) according to the\nuncertainty principle, that is due to quantum fluctuations; in other words we\npropose in a precise but limited context an answer to Heidegger's famous\nquestion \"Why is there something rather than nothing.\" The mechanism is the\nsame as that whereby an idealized pencil balanced on its point cannot remain so\nand must tip over. If it is moreover assumed that the Universe expands at the\nminimum asymptotic rate consistent with the uncertainty principle then the\nresult is spatial flatness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 22:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-27"}
