At leading order in the\ncoupling, the evolution of this system is given by classical solutions of the\nfield equation of motion. However, this system is subject to a parametric\nresonance that leads to secular divergences in higher order corrections to\nphysical observables. We have proposed a scheme that resums all the leading\nsecular terms: this resummation leads to finite results at all times, and we\nhave observed also that it makes the pressure tensor of the system relax to its\nequilibrium value.\n  In the present paper, we continue the study of this system by looking at\nfiner details of its dynamics. We first compute its spectral function at\nvarious stages of the evolution, and we observe that after a fairly short\ntransient time there are well defined massive quasi-particles. We then consider\nthe time evolution of the momentum distribution of these quasi-particles, and\nwe show that after a stage dominated by the parametric resonance, this\ndistribution slowly evolves to an equilibrium distribution. Interestingly, this\ndistribution develops a transient chemical potential, signalling the fact that\nnumber changing processes are much slower than the elastic ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 16:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 12:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We investigate the NIR flux\nvariation of the torus in response to a UV flash for various geometries.\nAnisotropic illumination by the disk and the torus self-occultation contrast\nour study with earlier works. Both the waning effect of each clump and the\ntorus self-occultation selectively reduce the emission from the region with a\nshort delay. Therefore, the NIR delay depends on the viewing angle (where a\nmore inclined angle leads to a longer delay) and the time response shows an\nasymmetric profile with a negative skewness, opposing to the results for\noptically thin tori. The range of the computed delay coincides with the\nobserved one, suggesting that the viewing angle is primarily responsible for\nthe scatter of the observed delay. We also propose that the red NIR-to-optical\ncolor of type-1.8/1.9 objects is caused by not only the dust extinction but\nalso the intrinsically red color. Compared with the modest torus thickness,\nboth a thick and a thin tori display the weaker NIR emission. A selection bias\nis thus expected such that NIR-selected AGNs tend to possess moderately thick\ntori. A thicker torus shows a narrower and more heavily skewed time profile,\nwhile a thin torus produces a rapid response. A super-Eddington accretion rate\nleads to a much weaker NIR emission due to the disk self-occultation and the\ndisk truncation by the self-gravity. A long delay is expected from an optically\nthin and/or a largely misaligned torus. A very weak NIR emission, such as in\nhot-dust-poor active nuclei, can arise from a geometrically thin torus, a\nsuper-Eddington accretion rate or a slightly misaligned torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 16:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We apply both speckle\nand (MO)MFBD techniques. We compare the spatial resolution and investigate the\nimpact of the reconstruction on spectral characteristics. The speckle\nreconstruction and MFBD perform similar for our imaging data with nearly\nidentical intensity contrasts. MFBD provides a better and more homogeneous\nresolution at the shortest wavelength. The MOMFBD and speckle deconvolution of\nthe intensity spectra lead to similar results, but our choice of settings for\nthe MOMFBD yields an intensity contrast smaller by about 2% at a comparable\nspatial resolution. None of the reconstruction techniques introduces artifacts\nin the intensity spectra. The speckle deconvolution (MOMFBD) has a rms noise in\nV/I of 0.32% (0.20%). The deconvolved spectra thus require a high significance\nthreshold of about 1.0%. A comparison to spectra with a significantly higher\nS/N ratio and to spectra from a MHD simulation reveals that the Goettingen FPI\ncan only detect about 30% of the polarization signal in quiet Sun. The\ndistribution of NCP values for the speckle-deconvolved data matches that of\nobservations with higher S/N better than MOMFBD, but shows seemingly\nartificially sharp boundaries and unexpected changes of the sign. For the\nspectropolarimetric data, the higher intensity contrast of the speckle\ndeconvolution is balanced by the smaller amplification of the noise level in\nthe MOMFBD at a comparable spatial resolution.

We confirm previous reports that the\npeaks at all frequencies are systematically shifted among them, possibly due to\nopacity effects in the jet as predicted by the standard relativistic jet model.\nWe use this model to estimate the magnetic field in the jet and the mass of the\ncentral black hole. We obtain a black-hole mass of ~2.e+7 solar masses,\ncomparable to estimates previously reported, but the magnetic fields obtained\nare thousands of times lower than previous estimates. We find that the\npositions of the cores at 1.7, 2.3, and 5GHz are less stable than that at\n8.4GHz and evolve systematically, shifting southward at a rate of several tens\nof micro-arcsec per year. The evolution in the jet orientation seems to be\nrelated to changes in the inclination of the cores at all frequencies. These\nresults can be interpreted as due to a precessing jet. The jet precession also\nseems to be related to a flare in the flux densities at 5.0 and 8.4GHz, which\nlasts ~4 years. A continued monitoring of the flux density and the jet\nstructure evolution in this LLAGN will be necessary to further confirm our jet\nprecession model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 18:52:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 11:29:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2011 12:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Unlike most traditional\napproaches to the dark-matter problem which hypothesize the existence of one or\nmore stable dark-matter particles, our dynamical dark-matter framework is\ncharacterized by the fact that the requirement of stability is replaced by a\ndelicate balancing between cosmological abundances and lifetimes across a vast\nensemble of individual dark-matter components. This setup therefore\ncollectively produces a time-varying cosmological dark-matter abundance, and\nthe different dark-matter components can interact and decay throughout the\ncurrent epoch.

The\nresults of this paper therefore constitute an \"existence proof\" of the\nphenomenological viability of our overall dynamical dark-matter framework, and\ndemonstrate that dynamical dark matter is indeed a viable alternative to the\ntraditional paradigm of dark-matter physics. Dynamical dark matter must\ntherefore be considered alongside other approaches to the dark-matter problem,\nparticularly in scenarios involving large extra dimensions or string theory in\nwhich there exist large numbers of particles which are neutral under\nStandard-Model symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 18:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Since the most luminous galaxies have a narrow spread in ages\n($1.0\\times 10^{10}$ yr $<t<1.2\\times 10^{10}$ yr), their metallicities are the\nmain factor that affects their colours.

The formation and survival of these\nfragments depends on the precarious balance between self-gravity, internal\npressure, tidal shearing, and rotation. Disk fragmentation depends on two key\nfactors (1) whether the disk can get to the fragmentation boundary of Q=1, and\n(2) whether fragments can survive for many orbital periods. Previous work\nsuggests that to reach Q=1, and have fragments survive, a disk must cool on an\norbital timescale.

Thus even\nthough irradiation heats disks, and makes them more stable in general, once\nthey reach the fragmentation boundary, they fragment more easily. We derive a\nnew cooling criterion that determines fragment survival, and calculate a\npressure modified Hill radius, which sets the maximum size of\npressure-supported objects in a Keplerian disk.

SKA can\nrepeatedly scan large (> 1 deg^2) areas of the sky, and thus will discover RSNe\nand other transient sources in a new, automatic, untargeted, and unbiased way.\nWe estimate SKA will be able to detect core-collapse RSNe out to redshift z ~\n5, with an all-redshift rate ~ 620 events yr^-1 deg^-2, assuming a survey\nsensitivity of 50 nJy and radio lightcurves like those of SN 1993J. Hence SKA\nshould provide a complete core-collapse RSN sample that is sufficient for\nstatistical studies of radio properties of core-collapse supernovae. EVLA\nshould find ~ 160 events yr^-1 deg^-2 out to redshift z ~ 3, and other SKA\nprecursors should have similar detection rates. We also provided\nrecommendations of the survey strategy to maximize the RSN detections of SKA.\nThis new radio core-collapse supernovae sample will complement the detections\nfrom the optical searches, such as the LSST, and together provide crucial\ninformation on massive star evolution, supernova physics, and the circumstellar\nmedium, out to high redshift. Additionally, SKA may yield the first radio Type\nIa detection via follow-up of nearby events discovered at other wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 03:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 17:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

It is well known that the\nstate of cold matter at supra-nuclear density depends on the non-perturbative\nnature of quantum chromo-dynamics (QCD) and is essential for modeling pulsars.\nA so-called H-cluster matter is proposed in this paper as the nature of dense\nmatter in reality.\n  In compact stars at only a few nuclear densities but low temperature, quarks\ncould be interacting strongly with each other there. That might render quarks\ngrouped in clusters, although the hypothetical quark-clusters in cold dense\nmatter has not been confirmed due to the lack of both theoretical and\nexperimental evidence. Motivated by recent lattice QCD simulations of the\nH-dibaryons (with structure uuddss), we are therefore considering here a\npossible kind of quark-clusters, H-clusters, that could emerge inside compact\nstars during their initial cooling, as the dominant components inside (the\ndegree of freedom could then be H-clusters there).Taking into account the\nin-medium stiffening effect, we find that at baryon densities of compact stars\n$H$-cluster matter could be more stable than nuclear matter. We also find that\nfor the H-cluster matter with lattice structure, the equation of state could be\nso stiff that it would seem to be \"superluminal\" in most dense region. However,\nthe real sound speed for H-cluster matter is in fact hard to calculate, so at\nthis stage we do not put constraints on our model from the usual requirment of\ncausality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 09:35:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 10:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 11:25:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 08:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

Keeping all the\ndynamical characteristics of a bubble described in the JLS model, the new model\nprovides additional information about the concentration of stock gains over\ntime. This allows us to understand better the risk diversification and to\nexplain the investors' behavior during the bubble generation. We apply this new\nmodel to two famous Chinese stock bubbles, from August 2006 to October 2007\n(bubble 1) and from October 2008 to August 2009 (bubble 2). The Zipf factor is\nfound highly significant for bubble 1, corresponding to the fact that valuation\ngains were more concentrated on the large firms of the Shanghai index. It is\nlikely that the widespread acknowledgement of the 80-20 rule in the Chinese\nmedia and discussion forums led many investors to discount the risk of a lack\nof diversification, therefore enhancing the role of the Zipf factor. For bubble\n2, the Zipf factor is found marginally relevant, suggesting a larger weight of\nmarket gains on small firms. We interpret this result as the consequence of the\nresponse of the Chinese economy to the very large stimulus provided by the\nChinese government in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 10:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-06"}

We\nconsider accretion rates for which the luminosities of the flows are between\n~0.001 and 0.01 of the Eddington luminosity. The black hole spin parameter\nstrongly affects the flow structure within the innermost 10 gravitational\nradii. The resulting large difference between the Coulomb heating in models\nwith a non-rotating and a rapidly rotating black hole is, however, outweighed\nby a strong contribution of compression work, much less dependent on spin. The\nconsequent reduction of effects related to the value of the black spin is more\nsignificant at smaller accretion rates. For a non-rotating black hole, the\ncompressive heating of electrons dominates over their Coulomb heating, and\nresults in an approximately constant radiative efficiency of approximately 0.4\nper cent in the considered range of luminosities. For a rapidly rotating black\nhole, the Coulomb heating dominates, the radiative efficiency is ~1 per cent\nand it slightly increases (but less significantly than estimated in some\nprevious works) with increasing accretion rate.

Non-linear (NL) gyrokinetic simulations using\nthe code GENE are compared with results from quasilinear (QL) gyrokinetic\nsimulations and a computationally efficient fluid model. The main focus is on\nmodel comparisons for electron temperature gra- dient driven turbulence\nregarding the sign of the convective impurity velocity (pinch) and the impurity\ndensity gradient R/LnZ (peaking factor) for zero impurity flux. In particular,\nthe scaling of the impurity peaking factors with impurity charge Z and with\ndriving temper- ature gradient is investigated and compared with the results\nfor Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven turbulence. In addition, the impurity\npeaking is compared to the main ion peaking obtained by a self-consistent fluid\ncalculation of the density gradients corresponding to zero particle fluxes.\n  For the scaling of the peaking factor with impurity charge Z, a weak\ndependence is obtained from NL GENE and fluid simulations. The QL GENE results\nshow a stronger dependence for low Z impurities and overestimates the peaking\nfactor by up to a factor of two in this region. As in the case of ITG dominated\nturbulence, the peaking factors saturate as Z increases, at a level much below\nneoclassical predictions. However, the scaling with Z is weak or reversed as\ncompared to the ITG case.\n  The scaling of impurity peaking with the background temperature gradients is\nfound to be weak in the NL GENE and fluid simulations. The QL results are also\nhere found to significantly overestimate the peaking factor for low Z values.\n  For the parameters considered, the background density gradient for zero\nparticle flux is found to be slightly larger than the corresponding impurity\nzero flux gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 14:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 17:37:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

During the past two years we have\nobtained multi-epoch polarimetric spectra of the beta Cephei star V1449 Aql\nwith SOFIN at the Nordic Optical Telescope to search for a rotation period and\nto constrain the geometry of the magnetic field.\n  The mean longitudinal magnetic field is measured at 13 different epochs. The\nnew measurements, together with the previous FORS1 measurements, have been used\nfor the frequency analysis and the characterization of the magnetic field.\n  V1449 Aql so far possesses the strongest longitudinal magnetic field of up to\n700G among the beta Cephei stars. The resulting periodogram displays three\ndominant peaks with the highest peak at f=0.0720d^-1 corresponding to a period\nP=13.893d. The magnetic field geometry can likely be described by a centred\ndipole with a polar magnetic field strength B_d around 3kG and an inclination\nangle beta of the magnetic axis to the rotation axis of 76+-4deg.

In this model,\ngravitationally bound cores form uniformly in the clump following a prescribed\ncore formation efficiency per unit time. After a contraction timescale which is\nequal to a few times their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and\npopulate the IMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account\nin the form of stellar winds. When the ratio of the effective wind energy of\nthe winds to the gravitational energy of the system reaches unity, gas is\nremoved from the clump and core and star formation are quenched. The power of\nthe radiation driven winds has a strong dependence on metallicity and increases\nwith increasing metallicity. Thus, winds from stars in the high metallicity\nmodels lead to a rapid evacuation of the gas from the protocluster clump and to\na reduced star formation efficiency, SFE_{exp}, as compared to their low\nmetallicity counterparts. By combining SFE_{exp} with the timescales on which\ngas expulsion occurs, we derive the metallicity dependent star formation rate\nper unit time in this model as a function of the gas surface density Sigma_{g}.\nThis is combined with the molecular gas fraction in order to derive the\ndependence of the surface density of star formation Sigma_{SFR} on Sigma_{g}.\nThis feedback regulated model of star formation reproduces very well the\nobserved star formation laws extending from low gas surface densities up to the\nstarburst regime. Furthermore, the results show a dependence of Sigma_{SFR} on\nmetallicity over the entire range of gas surface densities, and can also\nexplain part of the scatter in the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 14:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-06"}

These global coronal variations can be modelled to a surprising\ndegree of accuracy. Recent high resolution observations of the Sun's magnetic\nfield in quiet regions, away from sunspots, show that there is a continual\nevolution of a small-scale magnetic field, presumably produced by small-scale\ndynamo action in the solar interior.\n  Sunspots, a natural consequence of the large-scale dynamo, emerge, evolve and\ndisperse over a period of several days.

After studying\nseveral models where flows are driven by a simultaneous action of convection\nand rotation, it is concluded that the destabilization is observed in the cases\nwhere centrifugal force acts against main convective circulation. At relatively\nlow Prandtl numbers this counter action can split the main vortex into two\ncounter rotating vortices, where the interaction leads to instability. At\nlarger Prandtl numbers, the counter action of the centrifugal force steepens an\nunstable thermal stratification, which triggers Rayleigh-B\\'enard instability\nmechanism. Both cases can be enhanced by advection of azimuthal velocity\ndisturbances towards the axis, where they grow and excite perturbations of the\nradial velocity.
