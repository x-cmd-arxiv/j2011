It is quite remarkable that, after integrating out\nquantum fluctuations, the renormalization-group flows agree exceedingly well\nwith a mean-field Hamiltonian where interband pair hopping plays an essential\nrole. Through interband pair hopping, electrons can overcome the repulsive\ninteraction between them and form resonating Cooper pairs between different\nbands. Unlike the conventional superconductors, the pairing mechanism in\nmultiband superconductors is resonating pair hopping between different bands,\njust like the resonating chemical bonds in benzene. The effective mean-field\nHamiltonian spots a small parameter dictating the critical temperature and also\nexplains how interband pair hopping always enahnces spin fluctuations at the\nnesting momentum connecting the Fermi surfaces. In short, no attractive glue is\nneeded and resonating interband pair hopping is the key to Cooper pair\nformation in unconventional superconductors.

The issues are primarily\nrelated to the problems of the dynamics of the Universe, namely, the need to\npostulate hypothetical entities - dark energy and dark matter, whose nature is\nunknown, but whose contribution to the energy content of the Universe is about\n95%. A \"severe trial for the entire fundamental theory\" turned out to be a\ndiscrepancy of 120 orders of magnitude between the experimentally established\nvalue of the cosmological constant and the calculated value of the energy\ndensity of the physical vacuum. Sharp questions arise also regarding the\nphysical essence of gravitation and the nature of its unique smallness as\ncompared with other interactions - nuclear ones, strong and weak, as well as\nelectromagnetic ones. Sufficiently acute problems in the perception of the\nUniverse as a single holistic system arise also at the level of microscales.\nFirst of all, we mean here the so called low-energy nuclear reactions, which\nare realized in the conditions of nonequilibrium low temperature plasma. The\nfundamental problems of such processes are usually not widely discussed, and\nmany physicists are very critical of the very possibility of implementing such\nprocesses. Our main hypothesis for understanding the key problems of\ncontemporary fundamental physics, including the indicated cosmological problems\nas well as a new class of electron-initiated nuclear chemical processes, is to\nintroduce the basic reference system associated with the electromagnetic\ncomponent of physical vacuum - EM vacuum of the expanding Universe, with a\nselection of global time t, being common for all points of the expanding\nUniverse and measured starting from the time of t = 0, which corresponds to the\nBig Bang.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2011 16:54:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 03:52:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 16:46:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2012 02:48:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 03:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2012 14:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2013 19:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 03:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

To solve the differential equations\nnumerically we use the Weighted Essentially Non-oscillatory method (WENO).\nAlthough the effects of dust on radia-tive transfer is well known, the resonant\nscattering of Ly{\\alpha} photons makes the problem non-trivial. For instance,\nif the medium has the optical depth of dust absorption and scattering to be\n{\\tau}a>>1, {\\tau}>>1, and {\\tau}>>{\\tau}a, the effective absorption optical\ndepth in a random walk scenario would be equal to \\surd\n{\\tau}a({\\tau}a+{\\tau}). We show, however, that for a resonant scattering at\nfrequency {\\nu}0, the effective absorption optical depth would be even larger\nthan {\\tau}({\\nu}0). If the cross section of dust scattering and absorption is\nfrequency-independent, the double-peaked structure of the frequency profile\ngiven by the resonant scattering is basically dust-independent. That is, dust\ncauses neither narrowing nor widening of the width of the double peaked\nprofile. One more result is that the time scales of the Ly{\\alpha} photon\ntransfer in the optically thick halo are also basically independent of the dust\nscattering, even when the scattering is anisotropic. This is because those time\nscales are mainly determined by the transfer in the frequency space, while dust\nscattering, either isotropic or anisotropic, does not affect the behavior of\nthe transfer in the frequency space when the cross section of scattering is\nwavelength-independent. This result does not support the speculation that dust\nwill lead to the smoothing of the brightness distribution of Ly{\\alpha} photon\nsource with optical thick halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2011 17:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A coordination mechanism aims to mitigate the impact of\nselfishness of jobs on the efficiency of schedules by defining a local\nscheduling policy on each machine. The scheduling policies induce a game among\nthe jobs and each job prefers to be scheduled on a machine so that its\ncompletion time is minimum given the assignments of the other jobs. We consider\nthe maximum completion time among all jobs as the measure of the efficiency of\nschedules. The approximation ratio of a coordination mechanism quantifies the\nefficiency of pure Nash equilibria (price of anarchy) of the induced game.\n  Our mechanisms are deterministic, local, and preemptive. Our first\ncoordination mechanism has approximation ratio $\\Theta(\\log m)$ and guarantees\nthat the induced game has pure Nash equilibria. This result improves a bound of\n$O(\\log^2 m)$ due to Azar, Jain, and Mirrokni and uses a global ordering of the\njobs according to their distinct IDs. Our second mechanism handles anonymous\njobs and has approximation ratio $O(\\frac{\\log m}{\\log \\log m})$ although the\ngame induced is not a potential game and, hence, the existence of pure Nash\nequilibria is not guaranteed by potential function arguments. However, it\nprovides evidence that the known lower bounds for non-preemptive coordination\nmechanisms could be beaten using preemptive scheduling policies. Our third\ncoordination mechanism also handles anonymous jobs and has a nice\ncost-revealing potential function. We use this potential function in order to\nprove the existence of equilibria and to upper-bound the price of anarchy of\nthe induced game by $O(\\log^2m)$. Our third coordination mechanism is the first\nthat handles anonymous jobs and simultaneously guarantees that the induced game\nis a potential game and has bounded price of anarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2011 20:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-12"}

Given a fixed measurement\nbudget, much smaller than the dimension of the signal, we consider the general\nproblem of designing compressive measurements to maximize the measurement\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as increasing SNR improves the detection\nperformance in a large class of detectors. We use a lexicographic optimization\napproach, where the optimal measurement design for sparsity level $k$ is sought\nonly among the set of measurement matrices that satisfy the optimality\nconditions for sparsity level k-1.

Second, we propose\ntwenty four normalized ITMs, derived from either mutual information,\ndivergence, or cross-entropy, for investigation.

Third, to better understand and select the ITMs, we suggest three\ndesirable features for classification assessment measures, which appear more\ncrucial and appealing from the viewpoint of classification applications. Using\nthese features as \"meta-measures\", we can reveal the advantages and limitations\nof ITMs from a higher level of evaluation knowledge.

In our experiments, a basic solution\nis microinjected close to a giant unilamellar vesicle, which induces a local\nchemical modification of some lipids in the external monolayer of the membrane.\nThis modification causes a local deformation of the vesicle, which then\nrelaxes. We present a theoretical description of this instability, taking into\naccount both the change of the equilibrium lipid density and the change of the\nspontaneous membrane curvature induced by the chemical modification. We show\nthat these two types of changes of the membrane properties yield different\ndynamics. In contrast, it is impossible to distinguish them when studying the\nequilibrium shape of a vesicle subjected to a global modification. In our\nmodel, the longest relaxation timescale is related to the intermonolayer\nfriction, which plays an important part when there is a change in the\nequilibrium density in one monolayer. We compare our experimental results to\nthe predictions of our model by fitting the measured time evolution of the\ndeformation height to the solution of our dynamical equations. We obtain good\nagreement between theory and experiments. Our fits enable us to estimate the\nintermonolayer friction coefficient, yielding values that are consistent with\nprevious measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2011 13:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
