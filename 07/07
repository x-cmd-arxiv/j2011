We study the\neffect of DAW polarisation, L-, R-, circular and elliptical, in different\nregimes inertial and kinetic on the efficiency of particle acceleration. We use\n2.5D PIC simulations to study how particles are accelerated when DAW, triggered\nby a solar flare, propagates in transversely inhomogeneous plasma that mimics\nsolar coronal loop. (i) In inertial regime, fraction of accelerated electrons\n(along the magnetic field), in density gradient regions is ~20% by the time\nwhen DAW develops 3 wavelengths and is increasing to ~30% by the time DAW\ndevelops 13 wavelengths. In all considered cases ions are heated in transverse\nto the magnetic field direction and fraction of the heated particles is ~35%.\n(ii) The case of R-circular, L- and R- elliptical polarisation DAWs, with the\nelectric field in the non-ignorable transverse direction exceeding several\ntimes that of in the ignorable direction, produce more pronounced parallel\nelectron beams and transverse ion beams in the ignorable direction. In the\ninertial regime such polarisations yield the fraction of accelerated electrons\n~20%. In the kinetic regime this increases to ~35%. (iii) The parallel electric\nfield that is generated in the density inhomogeneity regions is independent of\nm_i/m_e and exceeds the Dreicer value by 8 orders of magnitude. (iv) Electron\nbeam velocity has the phase velocity of the DAW. Thus electron acceleration is\nvia Landau damping of DAWs. For the Alfven speeds of 0.3c the considered\nmechanism can accelerate electrons to energies circa 20 keV.

AM CVn systems are stellar binaries with some of the\nsmallest separations known and orbital periods ranging from 5 to 65 minutes.\nThey are believed to be composed of a white dwarf accretor and a\n(semi)-degenerate He-rich donor and are considered to be the helium equivalents\nof Cataclysmic Variables. We have spectroscopically and photometrically\nidentified an orbital period of 26.77 \\pm 0.02 minutes for PTF1\nJ071912.13+485834.0 and found a super-outburst recurrence time of greater than\n65 days along with the presence of \"normal\" outbursts - rarely seen in AM CVn\nsystems but well known in super-outbursting Cataclysmic Variables. We present a\nlong-term light curve over two super-cycles as well as high cadence photometry\nof both outburst and quiescent stages, both of which show clear variability. We\nalso compare both the outburst and quiescent spectra of PTF1\nJ071912.13+485834.0 to other known AM CVn systems, and use the quiescent\nphase-resolved spectroscopy to determine the origin of the photometric\nvariability. Finally, we draw parallels between the different subclasses of SU\nUMa-type Cataclysmic Variables and outbursting AM CVn systems. We conclude by\npredicting that the Palomar Transient Factory may more than double the number\nof outbursting AM CVn systems known, which would greatly increase our\nunderstanding of AM CVn systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 18:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We discuss how the\ndimer models for general Y^{p,q} manifolds give rise to other relativistic\nintegrable systems, generalizing the periodic Toda chain and construct the\nintegrable systems for general Y^{p,p} explicitly. The impurities introduced in\nthe construction of Y^{p,q} quivers are identified with impurities in twisted\nsl(2) XXZ spin chains. Finally we discuss how the physical concept of higgsing\na dimer model provides an efficient method for producing new integrable systems\nstarting from known ones. We illustrate this idea by constructing the\nintegrable systems for higgsings of Y^{4,0}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 20:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 06:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The phenomenological similarities between the shear-banding transition\nand phase transitions has pushed some researchers to adopt a 'thermodynamical'\napproach, in opposition to the more classical 'mechanical' approach to fluid\nflows. In this heuristic review, we describe why the apparent dichotomy between\nthose approaches has slowly faded away over the years. To support our\ndiscussion, we give an overview of different interpretations of a single\nequation, the diffusive Johnson-Segalman (dJS) equation, in the context of\nshear-banding. We restrict ourselves to dJS, but we show that the equation can\nbe written in various equivalent forms usually associated with opposite\napproaches. We first review briefly the origin of the dJS model and its initial\nrheological interpretation in the context of shear-banding. Then we describe\nthe analogy between dJS and reaction-diffusion equations. In the case of\nanisotropic diffusion, we show how the dJS governing equations for steady shear\nflow are analogous to the equations of the dynamics of a particle in a quartic\npotential. Going beyond the existing literature, we then draw on the Lagrangian\nformalism to describe how the boundary conditions can have a key impact on the\nbanding state. Finally, we reinterpret the dJS equation again and we show that\na rigorous effective free energy can be constructed, in the spirit of early\nthermodynamic interpretations or in terms of more recent approaches exploiting\nthe language of irreversible thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 20:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}

Here we use our new\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulation (MassiveBlack) covering a volume (0.75\n\\Gpc)^3 appropriate for studying the rare first quasars to show that steady\nhigh density cold gas flows responsible for assembling the first galaxies\nproduce the high gas densities that lead to sustained critical accretion rates\nand hence rapid growth commensurate with the existence of ~10^9 solar mass\nblack holes as early as z~7.

The problem is really one of model-testing, and the relevant\nquantity is the Bayesian evidence (marginal likelihood) of the signal model.\nGiven a signal template and an ongoing data stream, we have developed an\nevidence-based filter that computes the Bayesian evidence that a signal is\npresent in the data.

The Coulomb interactions between the proton\nand the core and the proton and the target are treated to all orders, including\nalso the full multipole expansion of the Coulomb potential. The dynamics of\nproton nuclear and Coulomb breakup is compared to that of an equiva- lent\nneutron of larger binding energy in order to elucidate the differences with the\nwell understood neutron breakup mechanism. A number of experimentally\nmeasurable observables such as parallel momentum distributions, proton angular\ndistributions and total breakup cross sections are calculated. With respect to\nnuclear breakup it is found that a proton behaves exactly as a neutron of\nlarger binding energy. The extra 'effective energy' is due to the combined\ncore-target Coulomb barrier. In Coulomb breakup we distinguish the effect of\nthe core-target Coulomb potential (called recoil effect), with respect to which\nthe proton behaves again as a more bound neutron, from the direct proton-target\nCoulomb potential. The latter gives cross sections about an order of magnitude\nlarger than the recoil term. The two effects give rise to complicated\ninterferences in the parallel momentum distributions. They are instead easily\nseparable in the proton angular distributions which are therefore suggested as\na very useful observable for future experimental studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 21:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-22"}

To assess habitability on the Galactic scale, we model supernova\nrates, planet formation, and the time required for complex life to evolve. Our\nstudy improves on other literature on the GHZ by populating stars on an\nindividual basis and by modelling SNII and SNIa sterilizations by selecting\ntheir progenitors from within this preexisting stellar population. Furthermore,\nwe consider habitability on tidally locked and non-tidally locked planets\nseparately, and study habitability as a function of height above and below the\nGalactic midplane.

Its proximity and rapid evolution makes it a unique case study of the\nearly phases in the development of a supernova remnant. One particular aspect\nof interest is the possible formation of dust in SN1987A, as SNe could\ncontribute significantly to the dust seen at high redshifts. Aims: We explore\nthe properties of SN1987A and its circumburst medium as seen at mm and sub-mm\nwavelengths, bridging the gap between extant radio and infrared (IR)\nobservations of respectively the synchrotron and dust emission. Methods:\nSN1987A was observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 3.2\nmm in July 2005, and with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) at 0.87 mm\nin May 2007. We present the images and brightness measurements of SN1987A at\nthese wavelengths for the first time. Results: SN1987A is detected as an\nunresolved point source of 11.2 +/- 2.0 mJy at 3.2 mm (5\" beam) and 21 +/- 4\nmJy at 0.87 mm (18\" beam). These flux densities are in perfect agreement with\nextrapolations of the powerlaw radio spectrum and modified-blackbody dust\nemission, respectively. This places limits on the presence of free-free\nemission, which is similar to the expected free-free emission from the ionized\nejecta from SN1987A. Adjacent, fainter emission is observed at 0.87 mm\nextending ~0.5' towards the south-west. This could be the impact of the\nsupernova progenitor's wind when it was still a red supergiant upon a dense\nmedium. Conclusions: We have established a continuous spectral energy\ndistribution for the emission from SN1987A and its immediate surroundings,\nlinking the IR and radio data. This places limits on the contribution from\nionized plasma. Our sub-mm image reveals complexity in the distribution of cold\ndust surrounding SN1987A, but leaves room for freshly synthesized dust in the\nSN ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 09:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The propagation of the jet is characterized by\nthe formation of a shocked \"head\" at the front of the jet which dissipates the\njet's energy and a cocoon that surrounds the jet and potentially collimates it.\nWe present here a self consistent, analytic model that follows the evolution of\nthe jet and its cocoon, and describes their interaction. We show that the\ncritical parameter that determines the properties of the jet-cocoon system is\nthe dimensionless ratio between the jet's energy density and the rest-mass\nenergy density of the ambient medium. This parameter, together with the jet's\ninjection angle, also determines whether the jet is collimated by the cocoon or\nnot. The model is applicable to relativistic, unmagnetized, jets on all scales\nand may be used to determine the conditions in AGNs jets as well as in GRBs or\nmicroquasars.

In small to medium bandwidth communications, as in the current\nstandards for OFDM and CDMA communication systems (with bandwidth up to 20\nMHz), such channels are individually sparse and at the same time share a common\nsupport set. Since the underlying physical channels are inherently\ncontinuous-time, we propose a parametric sparse estimation technique based on\nfinite rate of innovation (FRI) principles. Parametric estimation is especially\nrelevant to MIMO communications as it allows for a robust estimation and\nconcise description of the channels. The core of the algorithm is a\ngeneralization of conventional spectral estimation methods to multiple input\nsignals with common support. We show the application of our technique for\nchannel estimation in OFDM (uniformly/contiguous DFT pilots) and CDMA downlink\n(Walsh-Hadamard coded schemes). In the presence of additive white Gaussian\nnoise, theoretical lower bounds on the estimation of SCS channel parameters in\nRayleigh fading conditions are derived. Finally, an analytical spatial channel\nmodel is derived, and simulations on this model in the OFDM setting show the\nsymbol error rate (SER) is reduced by a factor 2 (0 dB of SNR) to 5 (high SNR)\ncompared to standard non-parametric methods - e.g. lowpass interpolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 10:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

While\nll-GRBs differ from typical long GRBs (LGRBs) in many aspects, they also share\nsome common features. Therefore, the question whether the gamma-ray emission of\nll-GRBs and LGRBs has a common origin is of great interest. Here we address\nthis question by testing whether ll-GRBs, like LGRBs according to the Collapsar\nmodel, can be generated by relativistic jets that punch holes in the envelopes\nof their progenitor stars. The collapsar model predicts that the durations of\nmost observed bursts will be comparable to, or longer than, the time it takes\nthe jets to breakout of the star. We calculate the jet breakout times of\nll-GRBs and compare them to the observed durations. We find that there is a\nsignificant access of ll-GRBs with durations that are much shorter than the jet\nbreakout time and that these are inconsistent with the Collapsar model. We\nconclude that the processes that dominate the gamma-ray emission of ll-GRBs and\nof LGRBs are most likely fundamentally different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 11:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This comparison of fluctuations in\nsubsystems of heat bath systems (Einstein) with those resulting from the\nrestriction of the QFT vacuum state to an open subvolume (Jordan) leads to a\nperfect analogy; the globally pure vacuum state becomes upon local restriction\na strongly impure KMS state. This phenomenon of localization-caused thermal\nbehavior as well as the vacuum-polarization clouds at the causal boundary of\nthe localization region places localization in QFT into a sharp contrast with\nquantum mechanics and justifies the attribute \"holstic\". In fact it positions\nthe E-J Gedankenexperiment into the same conceptual category as the\ncosmological constant problem and the Unruh Gedankenexperiment. The holistic\nstructure of QFT resulting from \"modular localization\" also leads to a revision\nof the conceptual origin of the crucial crossing property which entered\nparticle theory at the time of the bootstrap S-matrix approach but suffered\nfrom incorrect use in the S-matrix settings of the dual model and string\ntheory. The new holistic point of view, which strengthens the autonomous aspect\nof QFT, also comes with new messages for gauge theory by exposing the clash\nbetween Hilbert space structure and localization and presenting alternative\nsolutions based on the use of stringlocal fields in Hilbert space. Among other\nthings this leads to a radical reformulation of the Englert-Higgs symmetry\nbreaking mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 13:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 11:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 13:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 17:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 09:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 15:12:58 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 11:38:14 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 13:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This means that when there are few\nmembers in the scheme, there is an increased risk of the liability value\ndeviating significantly from the expected liability value, as compared to a\nlarge scheme.\n  We quantify this risk through examining the coefficient of variation of a\nscheme's liability value relative to its expected value. We examine how the\ncoefficient of variation varies with the number of members and find that, even\nwith a few hundred members in the scheme, idiosyncratic mortality risk may\nstill be significant. Using a stochastic mortality model reduces the\nidiosyncratic mortality risk but at the cost of increasing the overall\nmortality risk in the scheme.\n  Next we quantify the amount of the mortality risk concentrated in the\nexecutive section of the scheme, where the executives receive a benefit that is\nhigher than the non-executive benefit. We use the Euler capital allocation\nprinciple to allocate the total standard deviation of the liability value\nbetween the executive and non-executive sections. We find that the proportion\nof the standard deviation allocated to the executive section is higher than is\nsuggested by an allocation based on the members' benefit amounts.

We calculate the bias in the lensing mass calibration as well as\nconsequences for absolute magnitude (i.e., k-corrections) and stellar mass\nestimates, for a large sample of SDSS Data Release 8 (DR8) galaxies. The\nredshifts are obtained with the template based photo-z code ZEBRA on the SDSS\nDR8 ugriz photometry. We assemble and characterise the calibration samples (~9k\nspectroscopic redshifts from four surveys) to obtain photometric redshift\nerrors and lensing biases corresponding to our full SDSS DR8 lens and source\ncatalogues. Our tests of the calibration sample also highlight the impact of\nobserving conditions in the imaging survey when the spectroscopic calibration\ncovers a small fraction of its footprint; atypical imaging conditions in\ncalibration fields can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the photo-z of\nthe full survey.

A key limitation of symbolic execution is in\ndealing with code containing loops. The problem is that even a single loop can\ngenerate a huge number of different symbolic execution paths, corresponding to\ndifferent number of loop iterations and taking various paths through the loop.\n  We introduce a technique which, given a start location above some loops and a\ntarget location anywhere below these loops, returns a feasible path between\nthese two locations, if such a path exists. The technique infers a collection\nof constraint systems from the program and uses them to steer the symbolic\nexecution towards the target. On reaching a loop it iteratively solves the\nappropriate constraint system to find out which path through this loop to take,\nor, alternatively, whether to continue below the loop. To construct the\nconstraint systems we express the values of variables modified in a loop as\nfunctions of the number of times a given path through the loop was executed.\n  We have built a prototype implementation of our technique and compared it to\nstate-of-the-art symbolic execution tools on simple programs with loops. The\nresults show significant improvements in the running time. We found instances\nwhere our algorithm finished in seconds, whereas the other tools did not finish\nwithin an hour. Our approach also shows very good results in the case when the\ntarget location is not reachable by any feasible path.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 14:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}

The present model considers the confining\ncolor tube as the cylindrical quark gluon bag with non-zero surface tension. A\nclose inspection of the free energies of elongated cylindrical bag and the\nconfining color tube that connects the static quark-antiquark pair allows us to\nfind out the string tension in terms of the surface tension, thermal pressure\nand the bag radius. Using the derived relation it is possible to estimate the\nbag surface tension at zero temperature directly from the lattice QCD data and\nto estimate the (tri)critical endpoint temperature. In the present analysis the\ntopological free energy of the cylindrical bag is accounted for the first time.\nThe requirement of positive entropy density of such bags leads to negative\nvalues of the surface tension coefficient of quark gluon bags at the cross-over\nregion, i.e. at the continuous transition to deconfined quarks and gluons. We\nargue that the cross-over existence at supercritical temperatures in ordinary\nliquids is also provided by the negative surface tension coefficient values. It\nis shown that the confining tube model naturally accounts for an existence of a\nvery pronounced surprising maximum of the tube entropy observed in the lattice\nQCD simulations, which, as we argue, signals about the fractional surface\nformation of the confining tube. In addition, using the developed formalism we\nsuggest the gas of free tubes model and demonstrate that it contains two\nphases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 15:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}

We observed the two debris disk systems\nHD 92945 and HD 141569 with sparse aperture masking (SAM), a new mode offered\non the NaCo instrument at the VLT. A search for faint companions was performed\nusing a detection strategy based on the analysis of closure phases recovered\nfrom interferograms recorded on the Conica camera. Our results demonstrate that\nSAM is a very competitive mode in the field of companion detection. We obtained\n5 sigma high-contrast detection limits at lambda/D of 2.5x10^{-3} (\\Delta L' =\n6.5) for HD 92945 and 4.6x10^{-3} (\\Delta L' = 5.8) for HD 141569.

We\nfurthermore show that the final dynamic range obtained is directly proportional\nto the error on the closure phase measurement. At the present performance\nlevels of 0.28 degree closure phase error, SAM is among the most competitive\ntechniques for recovering companions at scales of one to several times the\ndiffraction limit of the telescope. Further improvements to the detection\nthreshold can be expected with more accurate phase calibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 15:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A particular\ninteresting case is X = beta(omega) \\ omega, where beta(omega) denotes the\nStone-Cech compactification of the natural numbers. This space, called the\ncorona or the remainder of omega, has been extensively studied in the fields of\nset theory and topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 15:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 12:28:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 19:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

The isoechogenic nature of\nprostate carcinoma makes it necessary to sample the gland systematically,\nresulting in a low sensitivity. Also, it is difficult for the clinician to\nfollow the sampling protocol accurately under 2D US control and the exact\nanatomical location of the biopsy cores is unknown after the intervention.\nTracking systems for prostate biopsies make it possible to generate biopsy\ndistribution maps for intra- and post-interventional quality control and 3D\nvisualisation of histological results for diagnosis and treatment planning.\nThey can also guide the clinician toward non-ultrasound targets. In this paper,\na volume-swept 3D US based tracking system for fast and accurate estimation of\nprostate tissue motion is proposed. The entirely image-based system solves the\npatient motion problem with an a priori model of rectal probe kinematics.\nProstate deformations are estimated with elastic registration to maximize\naccuracy. The system is robust with only 17 registration failures out of 786\n(2%) biopsy volumes acquired from 47 patients during biopsy sessions. Accuracy\nwas evaluated to 0.76$\\pm$0.52mm using manually segmented fiducials on 687\nregistered volumes stemming from 40 patients. A clinical protocol for assisted\nbiopsy acquisition was designed and implemented as a biopsy assistance system,\nwhich allows to overcome the draw-backs of the standard biopsy procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 06:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-11"}
