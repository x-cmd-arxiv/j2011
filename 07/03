Chapter three studies the notion of rings\nconstructed using the natural class of intervals. Matrix theory using the\nspecial class of intervals is analyzed in chapter four of this book. Chapter\nfive deals with polynomials using interval coefficients. New types of rings of\nnatural intervals are introduced and studied in chapter six. The notion of\nvector space using natural class of intervals is built in chapter seven. In\nchapter eight fuzzy natural class of intervals are introduced and algebraic\nstructures on them is built and described. Algebraic structures using natural\nclass of neutrosophic intervals are developed in chapter nine.Chapter ten\nsuggests some possible applications. The final chapter proposes over 200\nproblems of which some are at research level and some difficult and others are\nsimple.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2011 16:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-05"}

In their virtual life players use eight basic actions which allow\nthem to interact with each other. These actions are communication, trade,\nestablishing or breaking friendships and enmities, attack, and punishment. We\nmeasure the probabilities for these actions conditional on previous taken and\nreceived actions and find a dramatic increase of negative behavior immediately\nafter receiving negative actions. Similarly, positive behavior is intensified\nby receiving positive actions. We observe a tendency towards anti-persistence\nin communication sequences. Classifying actions as positive (good) and negative\n(bad) allows us to define binary 'world lines' of lives of individuals.\nPositive and negative actions are persistent and occur in clusters, indicated\nby large scaling exponents alpha~0.87 of the mean square displacement of the\nworld lines. For all eight action types we find strong signs for high levels of\nrepetitiveness, especially for negative actions. We partition behavioral\nsequences into segments of length n (behavioral `words' and 'motifs') and study\ntheir statistical properties. We find two approximate power laws in the word\nranking distribution, one with an exponent of kappa-1 for the ranks up to 100,\nand another with a lower exponent for higher ranks. The Shannon n-tuple\nredundancy yields large values and increases in terms of word length, further\nunderscoring the non-trivial statistical properties of behavioral sequences. On\nthe collective, societal level the timeseries of particular actions per day can\nbe understood by a simple mean-reverting log-normal model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2011 16:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-15"}

A clear evidence of intrinsic\nphase separation at 520 K between two competing phases, (i) a first majority\nmagnetic phase with a ThCr2Si2-type tetragonal lattice modulated by the iron\nvacancy ordering and (ii) a minority non-magnetic phase having an in-plane\ncompressed lattice volume and a weak superstructure, is reported. The XRD peaks\ndue to the Fe vacancy ordering in the majority phase disappear by increasing\nthe temperature at 580 K, well above phase separation temperature confirming\nthe order-disorder phase transition. The intrinsic phase separation at 520K\nbetween a competing first magnetic phase and a second non-magnetic phase in the\nnormal phase both having lattice superstructures (that imply different Fermi\nsurface topology reconstruction and charge density) is assigned to a\nlattice-electronic instability of the K0.8Fe1.6Se2 system typical of a system\ntuned at a Lifshitz critical point of an electronic topological transition that\ngives a multi-gaps superconductor tuned a shape resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2011 20:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-05"}

In particular we focus on the\ntransition from mass loss dominated by a short duration jet flow (driven during\nthe PPN phase) to mass loss driven by a spherical fast wind (produced by the\ncentral star of the PN). We address how such changes in outflow characteristics\ncan change the nebula from a bipolar to an elliptical morphology. Our results\nshow that including a period of jet formation in the temporal sequence of PPN\nto PN produces realistic nebular synthetic emission geometries. More\nimportantly such a sequence provides insight, in principle, into the apparent\ndifference in morphology statistics characterizing PPN and PN systems.

The particularly intriguing problem arising in the multi-antenna IC with\nIDC is that transmitters may now have the incentive to amplify the interference\ngenerated at the non-intended receivers, in the hope that Rxs have a better\nchance of decoding the interference and removing it. This notion completely\nchanges the previous paradigm of balancing between maximizing the desired\nenergy and reducing the generated interference, thus opening up a new dimension\nfor the beamforming design strategy.\n  Our contributions proceed by proving that the optimal rank of the transmit\nprecoders, optimal in the sense of Pareto optimality and therefore sum rate\noptimality, is rank one.

The positions and velocities of\nthe OH and methanol masers are consistent with Keplerian rotation around a\ncentral mass of ~ 5 Msun. The water masers are offset from the OH and methanol\nmasers and have significantly changed since they were last observed, but still\nappear to be associated to the outflow from the source. All the OH masers\ncomponents are circularly polarised, in some cases reaching 100 percent while\nsome OH components also have linear polarisation. We identify one Zeeman pair\nof OH masers and the splitting of this pair indicates a magnetic field of\nstrength ~ 11 mG within ~ 0.5\" (850 AU) of the central source. The OH and\nmethanol maser emission suggest that the disk material is dense, n > 10^6\ncm^-3, and warm, T > 125 K and the high abundance of methanol required by the\nmaser emission is consistent with the evaporation of the mantles on dust grains\nin the disk as a result of heating or shocking of the disk material\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2011 11:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-05"}

Besides the best fitted results for\ndouble-peaked broad optical balmer lines of 3C390.3 by theoretical disk model,\nwe try to find another way to further confirm the origination of double-peaked\nline from accretion disk. Based on the long-period observed spectra in optical\nband around 1995 collected from AGN WATCH project, the theoretical disk\nparameters of disk-like BLRs supposed by elliptical accretion disk model\n(Eracleous et al. 1995) have been well determined. Through the theoretical\ndisk-like BLRs, characters of observed light-curves of broad double-peaked\nH$\\alpha$ of 3C390.3 can be well reproduced based on the reverberation mapping\ntechnique. Thus the accretion disk model is preferred as one better model for\nBLRs of 3C390.3. Furthermore, we can find that different disk parameters should\nlead to some different results about size of BLRs of 3C390.3 from the one\nmeasured through observational data, which indicates the measured disk\nparameters are significantly valid for 3C390.3. After that, the precession of\ntheoretical elliptical disk-like BLRs being considered, we can find that the\nexpected line profile in 2000 by theoretical model is consistent with the\nobserved line profile by HST around 2000. Based on the results, we can further\nbelieve that the origination of broad double-peaked balmer emission lines of\n3C390.3 are from accretion disk around central black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2011 12:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Towards some of these regions, OH masers are associated with\nHII regions. Towards others, believed to be in an earlier evolutionary state,\nOH masers are offset from HII regions. Towards these later regions, it is\nbelieved that OH masers are associated with the circumstellar disk (e.g. Edris\net al. 2005; Gray et al. 2003). These disks should be hosting dense dust\ngrains.
