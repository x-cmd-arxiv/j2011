The objective function is defined only over\nthe set where all the constraints are satisfied.

To this end, two\ndifferent classes of multifractal rough surfaces are numerically simulated. As\nthe first group, singular measure multifractal rough surfaces are generated by\nusing the $p$ model. The smoothened multifractal rough surface then is\nsimulated by convolving the first group with a so-called Hurst exponent, $H^*$\n. The generalized multifractal dimension of isoheight lines (contours), $D(q)$,\ncorrelation exponent of contours, $x_l$, cumulative distributions of areas,\n$\\xi$, and perimeters, $\\eta$, are calculated for both synthetic multifractal\nrough surfaces. Our results show that for both mentioned classes, hyperscaling\nrelations for contour loops are the same as that of monofractal systems. In\ncontrast to singular measure multifractal rough surfaces, $H^*$ plays a leading\nrole in smoothened multifractal rough surfaces. All computed geometrical\nexponents for the first class depend not only on its Hurst exponent but also on\nthe set of $p$ values. But in spite of multifractal nature of smoothened\nsurfaces (second class), the corresponding geometrical exponents are controlled\nby $H^*$, the same as what happens for monofractal rough surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 18:22:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2012 07:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-20"}

This is consistent with\nthe D-ETGs residing in lower density environments compared to the controls\ndrawn from the general ETG population. 80% of D-ETGs inhabit the field\n(compared to 60% of the controls) and <2% inhabit clusters (compared to 10% of\nthe controls). Compared to the controls, D-ETGs exhibit bluer UV-optical\ncolours (indicating enhanced star formation) and an AGN fraction that is more\nthan an order of magnitude greater (indicating higher incidence of nuclear\nactivity). The clumpy dust mass residing in large-scale features is estimated,\nusing the SDSS r-band images, to be 10^{4.5}-10^{6.5} MSun. A comparison to the\ntotal (clumpy + diffuse) dust masses- calculated using the far-IR fluxes of 15%\nof the D-ETGs that are detected by the IRAS- indicates that only ~20% of the\ndust resides in these large-scale features. The dust masses are several times\nlarger than the maximum value expected from stellar mass loss, ruling out an\ninternal origin. The dust content shows no correlation with the blue\nluminosity, indicating that it is not related to a galactic scale cooling flow.\nNo correlation is found with the age of the recent starburst, suggesting that\nthe dust is accreted directly in the merger rather than being produced in situ\nby the triggered star formation. Using molecular gas-to-dust ratios of ETGs in\nthe literature we estimate that the median current and initial molecular gas\nfraction are ~1.3% and ~4%, respectively. Recent work suggests that the merger\nactivity in nearby ETGs largely involves minor mergers (mass ratios between\n1:10 and 1:4). If the IRAS-detected D-ETGs form via this channel, then the\noriginal gas fractions of the accreted satellites are 20%-44%.

The CH3OH masers have been suggested to\ntrace a Keplerian-disk, while the H2O masers are almost aligned to the outflow.\nMore recent results suggested that the region hosts a torus and potentially a\ndisk, but with a different inclination than the Keplerian-disk that is supposed\nto be traced by the CH3OH masers.

Methods. We use data from the HARPS\nhigh-precision planet-search sample comprising 304 FGK stars followed over\nabout 7 years. We obtain high-precision Ca II H&K chromospheric activity\nmeasurements and convert them to R'HK indices using an updated calibration\ntaking into account stellar metallicity. We study R'HK variability as a\nfunction of time and search for possible correlations with radial velocities\nand line shape parameters. Results. We classify stars according to the\nmagnitude and timescale of the Ca II H&K variability, and identify activity\ncycles whenever possible. We find that 39+/-8% of old solar-type stars in the\nsolar neighborhood do not show any activity cycles (or only very weak ones),\nwhile 61+/-8% do have one.

A famous example thereof is the classical\ndegree-constrained MST problem, where for every vertex v, a simple upper bound\non the degree is imposed. Iterative rounding/relaxation algorithms became the\ntool of choice for degree-bounded network design problems. A cornerstone for\nthis development was the work of Singh and Lau, who showed for the\ndegree-bounded MST problem how to find a spanning tree violating each degree\nbound by at most one unit and with cost at most the cost of an optimal solution\nthat respects the degree bounds.\n  However, current iterative rounding approaches face several limits when\ndealing with more general degree constraints. In particular, when several\nconstraints are imposed on the edges adjacent to a vertex v, as for example\nwhen a partition of the edges adjacent to v is given and only a fixed number of\nelements can be chosen out of each set of the partition, current approaches\nmight violate each of the constraints by a constant, instead of violating all\nconstraints together by at most a constant number of edges. Furthermore, it is\nalso not clear how previous iterative rounding approaches can be used for\ndegree constraints where some edges are in a super-constant number of\nconstraints.\n  We extend iterative rounding/relaxation approaches both on a conceptual level\nas well as aspects involving their analysis to address these limitations. This\nleads to an efficient algorithm for the degree-constrained MST problem where\nfor every vertex v, the edges adjacent to v have to be independent in a given\nmatroid.

Several approaches exist to account for\nthis feature but they do not usually enable the investigator to pinpoint the\nsites that evolve under one or another rate of evolution in a straightforward\nmanner. The focus is on Bayesian phylogenetic mixture models, augmented with\nallocation variables, as tools for site classification and quantification of\nclassification uncertainty. The method does not rely on prior knowledge of site\nmembership to classes or even the number of classes. Furthermore, it does not\nrequire correlated sites to be next to one another in the sequence alignment,\nunlike some phylogenetic hidden Markov or change-point models. In the approach\npresented, model selection on the number and type of mixture components is\nconducted ahead of both model estimation and site classification; the\nsteppingstone sampler (SS) is used to select amongst competing mixture models.\nExample applications of simulated data and mitochondrial DNA of primates\nillustrate site classification via 'augmented' Bayesian phylogenetic mixtures.\nIn both examples, all mixtures outperform commonly-used models of among-site\nrate variation and models that do not account for rate heterogeneity. The\nexamples further demonstrate how site classification is readily available from\nthe analysis output. The method is directly relevant to the choice of\npartitions in Bayesian phylogenetics, and its application may lead to the\ndiscovery of structure not otherwise recognised in a molecular sequence\nalignment. Computational aspects of Bayesian phylogenetic model estimation are\ndiscussed, including the use of simple Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) moves\nthat mix efficiently without tempering the chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 21:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 17:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 10:51:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 07:40:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 19:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-23"}

The work has two major components: the underlying theory of\ninformation acquisition in the exploration of unknown fields and the results of\nexperiments on how humans use sensor-equipped robots to perform a simulated\nreconnaissance exercise.\n  The theoretical framework reported herein extends work on robotic exploration\nthat has been reported by ourselves and others. Several new figures of merit\nfor evaluating exploration strategies are proposed and compared. Using concepts\nfrom differential topology and information theory, we develop the theoretical\nfoundation of search strategies aimed at rapid discovery of topological\nfeatures (locations of critical points and critical level sets) of a priori\nunknown differentiable random fields. The theory enables study of efficient\nreconnaissance strategies in which the tradeoff between speed and accuracy can\nbe understood. The proposed approach to rapid discovery of topological features\nhas led in a natural way to to the creation of parsimonious reconnaissance\nroutines that do not rely on any prior knowledge of the environment. The design\nof topology-guided search protocols uses a mathematical framework that\nquantifies the relationship between what is discovered and what remains to be\ndiscovered. The quantification rests on an information theory inspired model\nwhose properties allow us to treat search as a problem in optimal information\nacquisition. A central theme in this approach is that \"conservative\" and\n\"aggressive\" search strategies can be precisely defined, and search decisions\nregarding \"exploration\" vs. \"exploitation\" choices are informed by the rate at\nwhich the information metric is changing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 22:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-28"}

This paper proposes a flexible\nbidirectional linear pipeline architecture based on widely-used dual-port\nSRAMs. A search tree is partitioned, and then mapped onto pipeline stages by a\nbidirectional fine-grained mapping scheme.

Second, we prove that two\nimages always appear for the weak-field lens by the Ellis wormhole. By using\nthese analytic results, we discuss astrometric image centroid displacements due\nto gravitational microlensing by the Ellis wormhole. The astrometric image\ncentroid trajectory by the Ellis wormhole is different from the standard one by\na spherical lensing object that is expressed by the Schwarzschild metric. The\nanomalous shift of the image centroid by the Ellis wormhole lens is smaller\nthan that by the Schwarzschild lens, provided that the impact parameter and the\nEinstein ring radius are the same. Therefore, the lensed image centroid by the\nEllis wormhole moves slower. Such a difference, though it is very small, will\nbe in principle applicable for detecting or constraining the Ellis wormhole by\nusing future high-precision astrometry observations. In particular, the image\ncentroid position gives us an additional information, so that the parameter\ndegeneracy existing in photometric microlensing can be partially broken.

This model presents several\nstructural similarities to other ensembles of constraint satisfaction problems,\nsuch as $k$-satisfiability ($k$-SAT), hypergraph bicoloring and graph coloring.\nFor many of these ensembles, as the number of constraints per variable grows,\nthe set of solutions shatters into an exponential number of well-separated\ncomponents. This phenomenon appears to be related to the difficulty of solving\nrandom instances of such problems. We prove a complete characterization of this\nclustering phase transition for random $k$-XORSAT. In particular, we prove that\nthe clustering threshold is sharp and determine its exact location. We prove\nthat the set of solutions has large conductance below this threshold and that\neach of the clusters has large conductance above the same threshold. Our proof\nconstructs a very sparse basis for the set of solutions (or the subset within a\ncluster). This construction is intimately tied to the construction of specific\nsubgraphs of the hypergraph associated with an instance of $k$-XORSAT.

Our\ngoal is to facilitate this remapping by developing interfaces between residual\nbody motions and navigational commands that exploit the degrees of freedom that\ndisabled individuals are most capable to coordinate. We present a new framework\nfor allowing spinal cord injured persons to control powered wheelchairs through\nsignals derived from their residual mobility.

At\none extreme, greedy opportunistic scheduling that allocates airtime to the user\nwith the largest instantaneous channel gain achieves the optimal spectrum\nefficiency and transmission reliability but the poorest user-level fairness. At\nthe other extreme, fixed TDMA scheduling achieves the fairest airtime\nallocation but the lowest spectrum efficiency and transmission reliability. To\nbalance the two competing objectives, extensive research efforts have been\nspent on designing opportunistic scheduling schemes that reach certain tradeoff\npoints between the two extremes. In this paper and in contrast to the\nconventional wisdom, we find that in relay-assisted cellular networks, fixed\nTDMA achieves the same optimal diversity gain as greedy opportunistic\nscheduling. In addition, by incorporating very limited opportunism, a simple\nrelaxed-TDMA scheme asymptotically achieves the same optimal system reliability\nin terms of outage probability as greedy opportunistic scheduling. This reveals\na surprising fact: transmission reliability and user fairness are no longer\ncontradicting each other in relay-assisted systems. They can be both achieved\nby the simple TDMA schemes. For practical implementations, we further propose a\nfully distributed algorithm to implement the relaxed-TDMA scheme.

Several\nalternative semantics have been put forward, exposing operational details of\nthe computation state. We propose instead to redesign Prolog around structured\nalternatives to the cut and clauses, keeping the expressive power and\ncomputation model but with a compositional denotational semantics over much\nsimpler states-just variable bindings. This considerably eases reasoning about\nprograms, by programmers and tools such as a partial evaluator, with safe\nunfolding of calls through predicate definitions. An if-then-else across\nclauses replaces most uses of the cut, but the cut's full power is achieved by\nan until construct. Disjunction, conjunction and until, along with unification,\nare the primitive goal types with a compositional semantics yielding sequences\nof variable-binding solutions. This extends to programs via the usual technique\nof a least fixpoint construction. A simple interpreter for Prolog in the\nalternative language, and a definition of until in Prolog, establish the\nidentical expressive power of the two languages. Many useful control constructs\nare derivable from the primitives, and the semantic framework illuminates the\ndiscussion of alternative ones. The formalisation rests on a term language with\nvariable abstraction as in the {\\lambda}-calculus. A clause is an abstraction\non the call arguments, a continuation, and the local variables. It can be\ninclusive or exclusive, expressing a local case bound to a continuation by\neither a disjunction or an if-then-else. Clauses are open definitions, composed\n(and closed) with simple functional application ({\\beta}-reduction). This paves\nthe way for a simple account of flexible module composition mechanisms.

We present a multi-wavelength, high-resolution observational survey\nof the young binary system Haro 6-10 (GV Tau, IRAS 04263+2426), which is\nharbouring one of the few known infrared companions. Aims. The primary goal of\nthis project is to determine the physical and geometrical properties of the\ncircumstellar and circumbinary material in the Haro 6-10 system. Methods.\nHigh-resolution optical (HST/WFPC2) and near-infrared (VLT/NACO) images in\ndifferent bands were analysed to investigate the large-scale structures of the\nmaterial around the binary.Mid-infrared interferometry (VLTI/MIDI) and\nspectroscopy (TIMMI2 at the 3.6m ESO telescope) were carried out to determine\nthe structure and optical depth of the circumstellar material around the\nindividual components. Results. The multi-wavelength observations suggest that\nboth components of the binary system Haro 6-10 are embedded in a common\nenvelope. The measured extinction indicates a dust composition of the envelope\nsimilar to that of the interstellar medium. Each component of the system has a\ncircumstellar disc-like structure typical of young stars. The discs are highly\nmisaligned: the northern component is seen almost edge-on and the southern\ncomponent is an almost face-on disc. Conclusions. The two main formation\nscenarios of binary systems with misaligned discs are the gravitational capture\nof a passing object in a dense environment, and the fragmentation of the\ncollapsing molecular cloud. Given the low-density environment of the\nTaurus-Aurigae star-forming region, the first scenario is unlikely for Haro\n6-10. The binary system most probably formed via fragmentation of two different\nparts of the collapsing molecular cloud combined with other dynamical processes\nrelated to the cloud and/or the protostars. This can be the explanation also\nfor other binary systems with an infrared companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 08:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Their proof invokes deep analytic and\ncombinatorial tools. In the present paper we notice that from the work of Bass\nand Tavgen one immediately gets a much more general result, asserting that over\nany ring of stable rank 1 one has unitriangular factorisation $G=UU^-UU^-$ of\nlength 4. Moreover, we give a detailed survey of triangular factorisations,\nprove some related results, discuss prospects of generalisation to other\nclasses of rings, and state several unsolved problems.

Flattened trispectra can be produced by line-like\nfeatures in 2D, for example from cosmic strings, and randomly located features\nalso give a non-Gaussian signal. There are relationships between the squeezed\ntypes of non-Gaussianity, and also a useful interpretation in terms of\nstatistical anisotropy. I discuss the various possible physical origins of\ncosmological non-Gaussianities, both in terms of primordial perturbations and\nlate-time dynamical and geometric effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 10:14:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 14:46:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 09:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-15"}

Due to\nstrongly enhanced genetic drift at the advancing frontier, neutral and weakly\ndeleterious mutations can reach large frequencies in the newly colonized\nregions, as if they were surfing the front of the range expansion. These\nfindings raise the question of how frequently beneficial mutations successfully\nsurf at shifting range margins, thereby promoting adaptation towards a\nrange-expansion phenotype. Here, we use individual-based simulations to study\nthe surfing statistics of recurrent beneficial mutations on wave-like range\nexpansions in linear habitats. We show that the rate of surfing depends on two\nstrongly antagonistic factors, the probability of surfing given the spatial\nlocation of a novel mutation and the rate of occurrence of mutations at that\nlocation. The surfing probability strongly increases towards the tip of the\nwave. Novel mutations are unlikely to surf unless they enjoy a spatial head\nstart compared to the bulk of the population. The needed head start is shown to\nbe proportional to the inverse fitness of the mutant type, and only weakly\ndependent on the carrying capacity. The second factor is the mutation\noccurrence which strongly decreases towards the tip of the wave. Thus, most\nsuccessful mutations arise at an intermediate position in the front of the\nwave. We present an analytic theory for the tradeoff between these factors that\nallows to predict how frequently substitutions by beneficial mutations occur at\ninvasion fronts. We find that small amounts of genetic drift increase the\nfixation rate of beneficial mutations at the advancing front, and thus could be\nimportant for adaptation during species invasions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 11:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 14:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 06:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-02"}

This hypothesis is motivated by the unusual morphological properties\nof the source, suggesting almost ballistic propagation of powerful jets in a\nparticularly low-density environment. New radio observations of J1420-0545\nconfirm its morphology consisting of only two narrow lobes; no trace of any\nouter low-density cavity due to the previous jet activity is therefore\ndetected. Different model fits performed using the newly accessed radio data\nimply relatively young age of the source, its exceptionally high expansion\nvelocity, large jet kinetic power, and confirm particularly low-density\nenvironment. We find that it is possible to choose a realistic set of the model\nparameters for which the hypothetical outer lobes of J1420-0545 are old enough\nso that their expected radio surface brightness is substantially below the rms\nnoise level of the available radio maps. On the other hand, the extremely low\ndensity of the gas surrounding the J1420-0545 lobes is consistent with the mean\ndensity of the baryonic matter in the Universe. This suggests that the source\nmay be instead located in a real void of the galaxy and matter distribution. In\nboth cases the giant radio lobes of J1420-0545 are expected to modify\nsubstantially the surrounding matter by driving strong shocks and heating the\ngas located at the outskirts of the filamentary galactic distribution.

It can\noccur that the bottom of one of the available subbands is situated in the\nvicinity of the Fermi level.

The idea stems from the fact\nthat the vector-vector interaction in s-wave and spin 2 is very strong, to the\npoint of generating the 2^++ tensor mesons. On the other hand the interaction\nof a pseudoscalar with a vector meson in s-wave is also very strong and it\ngenerates dynamically the lightest axial-vector mesons. Therefore we expect the\nPVV interaction to be strongly attractive and thus able to build up quasibound\nPVV resonances.

This allows us to derive the reddening\nmap on a small enough scale to minimize the problems arising from differential\nextinction. The dereddened magnitudes are then used to build the bulge\nluminosity function in regions of 0.4 x 0.4 deg to obtain the mean RC\nmagnitudes. These are used as distance indicator in order to trace the bulge\nstructure.

The phase diagram as a function of the\ntransverse coupling J_{\\perp} and the frustration J_2 exhibits an Ising\ntransition between a columnar phase of dimers and the usual rung-singlet phase\nof two-leg ladders.

The ratio of the ferromagnetic\nexchange energy (J$_F$) and antiferromagnetic exchange energy (J$_{AF}$),\n|J$_F$ /J$_{AF}|, is a key indicator of the stability of the charge ordered and\nantiferromagnetic ordered state. This ratio is obtained from the spin wave\nspectrum by inelastic neutron scattering and is sufficiently large to suggest\nthat the magnetic exchange energy alone can stabilize the charge ordered state\nin La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ and Pr$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$. The\nexchange ratio decreases from La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ to\nNd1$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ which indicates a gradual destabilization of the\nmagnetic exchange mechanism for charge ordering in correspondence with the\nobserved reduction in the ordering temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 15:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We introduce a framework called proximity penalty priors\n(PPPs) that allows this preference to be made explicit in the prior\ninformation. The approach is scale-free and imposes minimal restrictions on the\nposterior; in particular no arbitrary thresholds need to be set. We show the\ntheoretical validity of the approach, and demonstrate the effects of using PPPs\non posterior distributions with simulated and real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 15:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-28"}

Such\ninverse monoids bear the same relationship to classical pseudogroups of\ntransformations as frames do to topological spaces. The goal of this paper is\nto develop the theory of pseudogroups motivated by applications to group\ntheory, C*-algebras and aperiodic tilings. Our starting point is an adjunction\nbetween a category of pseudogroups and a category of etale groupoids from which\nwe are able to set up a duality between spatial pseudogroups and sober etale\ngroupoids. As a corollary to this duality, we deduce a non-commutative version\nof Stone duality involving what we call boolean inverse semigroups and boolean\netale groupoids, as well as a generalization of this duality to distributive\ninverse semigroups. Non-commutative Stone duality has important applications in\nthe theory of C*-algebras: it is the basis for the construction of Cuntz and\nCuntz-Krieger algbras and in the case of the Cuntz algebras it can also be used\nto construct the Thompson groups. We then define coverages on inverse\nsemigroups and the resulting presentations of pseudogroups. As applications, we\nshow that Paterson's universal groupoid is an example of a booleanization, and\nreconcile Exel's recent work on the theory of tight maps with the work of the\nsecond author.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 15:44:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 11:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-08"}

It is shown that the PPB-induced AFM\nfluctuation in the superconducting state leads to an enhancement of the vortex\nlattice form factor which is a measure of spatial variations of the internal\nmagnetic field and that the enhancement becomes more remarkable as an AFM\ninstability is approached. It is also demonstrated that the PPB-induced AFM\nordering is assisted by the vortex-lattice modulation, and thus, that the\nresulting AFM order is spatially modulated, while it is not localized in the\nvortex cores but coexistent with the nonvanishing superconducting order\nparameter.
