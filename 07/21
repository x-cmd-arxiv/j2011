In this chapter we present a set of metrics needed to\nquantify the risks. The metrics are designed to help: 1) the QA team to assess\ntheir processes; 2) the support and maintenance teams to allocate their\nresources; and 3) the customers to assess the risk associated with using the\nsoftware product. The paper includes a validation case study which applies the\nrisk metrics to industrial data. To calculate the metrics we use mathematical\ninstruments like the heavy-tailed Kappa distribution and the G/M/k queuing\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 16:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

The proposed\nsolution employs lattice reduction (LR)-aided regularized (lattice) sphere\ndecoding and proper timeout policies. These performance and complexity\nguarantees hold for most MIMO scenarios, all reasonable fading statistics, all\nchannel dimensions and all full-rate lattice codes.\n  In sharp contrast to the above manageable complexity, the complexity of other\nstandard preprocessed lattice decoding solutions is shown here to be extremely\nhigh. Specifically the work is first to quantify the complexity of these\nlattice (sphere) decoding solutions and to prove the surprising result that the\ncomplexity required to achieve a certain rate-reliability performance, is\nexponential in the lattice dimensionality and in the number of codeword bits,\nand it in fact matches, in common scenarios, the complexity of ML-based\nsolutions. Through this sharp contrast, the work was able to, for the first\ntime, rigorously quantify the pivotal role of lattice reduction as a special\ncomplexity reducing ingredient.\n  Finally the work analytically refines transceiver DMT analysis which\ngenerally fails to address potentially massive gaps between theory and\npractice. Instead the adopted vanishing gap condition guarantees that the\ndecoder's error curve is arbitrarily close, given a sufficiently high SNR, to\nthe optimal error curve of exact solutions, which is a much stronger condition\nthan DMT optimality which only guarantees an error gap that is subpolynomial in\nSNR, and can thus be unbounded and generally unacceptable in practical\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 16:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

A\ncontroller compares the signal measured by a sensor with the target value. It\nadjusts then an actuator in order to stabilize the signal towards its target.\nGeneralizing this scheme to stabilize a micro-system's quantum state relies on\nquantum feedback, which must overcome a fundamental difficulty: the\nmeasurements by the sensor have a random back-action on the system. An optimal\ncompromise employs weak measurements providing partial information with minimal\nperturbation. The controller should include the effect of this perturbation in\nthe computation of the actuator's unitary operation bringing the incrementally\nperturbed state closer to the target. While some aspects of this scenario have\nbeen experimentally demonstrated for the control of quantum or classical\nmicro-system variables, continuous feedback loop operations permanently\nstabilizing quantum systems around a target state have not yet been realized.\nWe have implemented such a real-time stabilizing quantum feedback scheme. It\nprepares on demand photon number states (Fock states) of a microwave field in a\nsuperconducting cavity and subsequently reverses the effects of\ndecoherence-induced field quantum jumps. The sensor is a beam of atoms crossing\nthe cavity which repeatedly performs weak quantum non-demolition measurements\nof the photon number. The controller is implemented in a real-time computer\ncommanding the injection, between measurements, of adjusted small classical\nfields in the cavity. The microwave field is a quantum oscillator usable as a\nquantum memory or as a quantum bus swapping information between atoms. By\ndemonstrating that active control can generate non-classical states of this\noscillator and combat their decoherence, this experiment is a significant step\ntowards the implementation of complex quantum information operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 16:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-06"}

We report rotation periods\nfor 40 late-K to mid-M stars members of the nearby, rich, intermediate-age\n(~600 Myr) open cluster Praesepe. These rotation periods were derived from ~200\nobservations taken by the Palomar Transient Factory of four cluster fields from\n2010 February to May. Our measurements indicate that Praesepe's mass-period\nrelation transitions from a well-defined singular relation to a more scattered\ndistribution of both fast and slow rotators at ~0.6 Msun. The location of this\ntransition is broadly consistent with expectations based on observations of\nyounger clusters and the assumption that stellar-spin down is the dominant\nmechanism influencing angular momentum evolution at 600 Myr. However, a\ncomparison to data recently published for the Hyades, assumed to be coeval to\nPraesepe, indicates that the divergence from a singular mass-period relation\noccurs at different characteristic masses, strengthening the finding that\nPraesepe is the younger of the two clusters.

Those domains have also been identified with the $W-t-\\bar{t}$ bags,\na non-topological soliton made of large number ($\\sim 1000$) of gauge quanta\nand heavy (top and anti-top) quarks. As real-time numerical studies had shown,\nsphalerons (topological transition events violating the baryon number) occur\nonly inside those bags. In this work we estimate the amount of CP violation in\nthis scenario coming from the Standard Model, via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\n(CKM) quark mixing matrix, resulting in top-minus-antitop difference of the\npopulation in the bags. Since these tops/anti-tops are \"recycled\" by\nsphalerons, this population difference leads directly to the baryonic asymmetry\nof the Universe. We look at the effect appearing in the 4th order in weak $W$\ndiagrams describing interference of different quark flavor contributions. We\nfound that there are multiple cancellations of diagrams and clearly\nsign-definite effect appears only in the 6th order expansion over\nflavor-dependent phases. We then estimate contributions to these diagrams in\nwhich weak interaction occurs (i) inside, (ii) near and (iii) far from the\n$W-t-\\bar{t}$ b-bags, optimizing the contributions in each of them. We conclude\nthat the second (\"near\") scenario is the dominant one, producing CP violation\nof the order of $10^{-10}$, in our crude estimates. Together with the baryon\nviolation rate of about $10^{-2}$, previously demonstrated for this scenario,\nit puts the resulting asymmetry close to what is needed to explain the observed\nbaryonic asymmetry in the Universe. Our answer also has a definite sign, which\napparently seems to be the correct one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 18:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Such a\ncorrelation has been suggested recently on the basis of data from Mn-54 decay\nduring the solar flare of 13 December 2006, and by indications of an annual and\nother periodic variations in the decay rates of Si-32, Cl-36, and Ra-226. Data\nfrom five measurements of the Cs-137 count rate over a period of approximately\n5.4 years have been fit to a formula which accounts for the usual exponential\ndecrease in count rate over time, along with the addition of a theoretical\nsolar contribution varying with MESSENGER-Sun separation. The indication of\nsolar influence is then characterized by a non-zero value of the calculated\nparameter \\xi, and we find \\xi=(2.8+/-8.1)x10^{-3} for Cs-137.

In order to compare to the baryonic properties of the\nlenses we focus here on the ~300 square degrees that overlap with the DR7 of\nthe SDSS. The depth and image quality of the RCS2 enables us to significantly\nimprove upon earlier work for luminous galaxies at z>=0.3. Comparison with\ndynamical masses from the SDSS shows a good correlation with the lensing mass\nfor early-type galaxies. For low luminosity (stellar mass) early-type galaxies\nwe find a satellite fraction of ~40% which rapidly decreases to <10% with\nincreasing luminosity (stellar mass). The satellite fraction of the late-types\nhas a value in the range 0-15%. We find that early-types in the range\n10^10<L_r<10^11.5 Lsun have virial masses that are about five times higher than\nthose of late-type galaxies and that the mass scales as M_200 \\propto L^2.34\n+0.09 \\ -0.16.

For late-type galaxies we find a lower value\nof M_200/L_200=17+-9. Our measurements also show that early- and late-type\ngalaxies have comparable halo masses for stellar masses M_*<10^11 Msun, whereas\nthe virial masses of early-type galaxies are higher for higher stellar masses.\nFinally, we determine the efficiency with which baryons have been converted\ninto stars. Our results for early-type galaxies suggest a variation in\nefficiency with a minimum of ~10% for a stellar mass M_*,200=10^12 Msun.

These trees are frequently used as inputs\nto semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to provide the backbone within\nwhich galaxy formation takes place. By necessity, these merger trees are\nconstructed from a finite set of discrete \"snapshots\" of the N-body simulation\nand so have a limited temporal resolution. To date, there has been little\nconsideration of how this temporal resolution affects the properties of\ngalaxies formed within these trees. In particular, the question of how many\nsnapshots are needed to achieve convergence in galaxy properties has not be\nanswered. Therefore, we study the convergence in the stellar and total baryonic\nmasses of galaxies, distribution of merger times, stellar mass functions and\nstar formation rates in the Galacticus model of galaxy formation as a function\nof the number of \"snapshot\" times used to represent dark matter halo merger\ntrees.

We find only weak dependence of the rate of\nconvergence on the distribution of snapshots in time - snapshots spaced\nuniformly in the expansion factor, uniformly in the logarithm of expansion\nfactor or uniformly in the logarithm of critical overdensity for collapse work\nequally well in almost all cases.

They yield spectral indices \\alpha \\approx -0.67 (where\nF_\\nu \\propto \\nu^\\alpha) with \\pm 0.15 (1\\sigma) scatter, typical of\nnonthermal (synchrotron) emission from star-forming galaxies. The contrast of\nour 4-8 GHz data with literature 1.5 and 8.4 GHz flux densities gives further\nevidence for curvature of the radio SED of U/LIRGs. The SED appears flatter\nnear \\sim 1 GHz than near \\sim 6 GHz, suggesting significant optical depth\neffects at the lower frequencies. The high frequency (28-37 GHz) flux densities\nare low compared to extrapolations from the 4-8 GHz data. We confirm and extend\nto higher frequency a previously observed deficit of high frequency radio\nemission for luminous starburst galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 20:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We explore the\nnature of the Mott insulator and the corresponding Mott transition when these\nshape fluctuations of the Fermi surface are suppressed without making any a\nprior assumptions about other Fermi surface shape fluctuations. Building on\ninsights from the theory of the Mott transition of bosons, we implement this\nsuppression by identifying and condensing vortex degrees of freedom in the\nphase of the low energy electron operator.

From an analysis of both equivalent widths and spectrum\nsynthesis, abundances have been determined for the elements Fe, Na, O, Mg, Si,\nCa, Ti, Ni, Zr, and for two of the 10 clusters, Al and Cr. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first detailed abundance analysis for clusters NGC 1245, NGC 2194,\nNGC 2355 and NGC 2425. These 10 clusters were selected for analysis because\nthey span a Galactocentric distance range Rgc~9-13 kpc, the approximate\nlocation of the transition between the inner and outer disk. Combined with\ncluster samples from our previous work and those of other studies in the\nliterature, we explore abundance trends as a function of cluster Rgc, age, and\n[Fe/H]. The [Fe/H] distribution appears to decrease with increasing Rgc to a\ndistance of ~12 kpc, and then flattens to a roughly constant value in the outer\ndisk. Cluster average element [X/Fe] ratios appear to be independent of Rgc,\nalthough the picture for [O/Fe] is more more complicated by a clear trend of\n[O/Fe] with [Fe/H] and sample incompleteness. Other than oxygen, no other\nelement [X/Fe] exhibits a clear trend with [Fe/H]; likewise, there does not\nappear to be any strong correlation between abundance and cluster age. We\ndivided clusters into different age bins to explore temporal variations in the\nradial element distributions. The radial metallicity gradient appears to have\nflattened slightly as a function of time, as found by other studies. There is\nalso indication that the transition from the inner disk to the outer disk\noccurs at different Galactocentric radii for different age bins.

We derive single-letter expressions for the secret key capacity\nthrough a type of source emulation analysis. We also derive lower bounds on the\nachievable reliability and secrecy exponents, i.e., the exponential rates of\ndecay of the probability of decoding error and of the information leakage.\nThese exponents allow us to determine a set of strongly-achievable secret key\nrates. For degraded eavesdroppers the maximum strongly-achievable rate equals\nthe secret key capacity; our exponents can also be specialized to previously\nknown results.\n  In deriving our strong achievability results we introduce a coding scheme\nthat combines wiretap coding (to excite the channel) and key extraction (to\ndistill keys from residual randomness). The secret key capacity is naturally\nseen to be a combination of both source- and channel-type randomness. Through\nexamples we illustrate a fundamental interplay between the portion of the\nsecret key rate due to each type of randomness. We also illustrate inherent\ntradeoffs between the achievable reliability and secrecy exponents. Our new\nscheme also naturally accommodates rate limits on the public discussion.

The number of potential sources within the brain exceeds by an\norder of magnitude the number of recording sites. As a consequence, the\nestimates for the magnitude and location of the neural sources will be\nill-conditioned because of the underdetermined nature of the problem. One\nwell-known technique designed to address this imbalance is the minimum norm\nestimator (MNE). This approach imposes an $L^2$ regularization constraint that\nserves to stabilize and condition the source parameter estimates. However,\nthese classes of regularizer are static in time and do not consider the\ntemporal constraints inherent to the biophysics of the MEG experiment. In this\npaper we propose a dynamic state-space model that accounts for both spatial and\ntemporal correlations within and across candidate intracortical sources.

We perform large-scale\nsimulations of randomly connected neuronal networks with biophysically\nrealistic parameters and find that the proposed methods can accurately infer\nthe connectivity in these networks given reasonable experimental and\ncomputational constraints.

One of the goals of the\nBaryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS-III) is to derive the Hubble expansion rate and the angular scale from\nthe BAO signal in the IGM. To this aim, the Lyman-alpha forest of 10^5 quasars\nwill be observed in the redshift range 2.2<z<3.5 and over 10,000 deg^2. We\nsimulated the BOSS QSO survey to estimate the statistical accuracy on the BAO\nscale determination provided by such a large scale survey. In particular, we\ndiscuss the effect of the poorly constrained estimate of the unabsorbed\nintrinsic quasar spectrum. The volume of current N-body simulations being too\nsmall for such studies, we resorted to Gaussian random field (GRF) simulations.\nWe validated the use of GRFs by comparing the output of GRF simulations with\nthat of the Horizon N-body simulation with the same initial conditions.\nRealistic mock samples of QSO Lyman-\\alpha forest were generated; their power\nspectrum was computed and fitted to obtain the BAO scale. The rms of the\nresults for 100 different simulations provides an estimate of the statistical\nerror expected from the BOSS survey. We confirm the results from Fisher matrix\nestimate. In the absence of error on the unabsorbed quasar spectrum, the BOSS\nquasar survey should measure the BAO scale with an error of the order of 2.3%,\nor the transverse and radial BAO scales separately with errors of the order of\n6.8% and 3.9%, respectively. The significance of the BAO detection is assessed\nby an average \\Delta\\chi^2=17 but for individual realizations \\Delta\\chi^2\nranges from 2 t o 35.

In particular, the possibility of finding them at the\ncenters of globular clusters has recently drawn attention. IMBHs became\ndetectable since the quality of observational data sets, particularly those\nobtained with HST and with high resolution ground based spectrographs, advanced\nto the point where it is possible to measure velocity dispersions at a spatial\nresolution comparable to the size of the gravitational sphere of influence for\nplausible IMBH masses. We present results from ground based VLT/FLAMES\nspectroscopy in combination with HST data for the globular cluster NGC 6388.\nThe aim of this work is to probe whether this massive cluster hosts an\nintermediate-mass black hole at its center and to compare the results with the\nexpected value predicted by the $M_{\\bullet} - \\sigma$ scaling relation. The\nspectroscopic data, containing integral field unit measurements, provide\nkinematic signatures in the center of the cluster while the photometric data\ngive information of the stellar density. Together, these data sets are compared\nto dynamical models and present evidence of an additional compact dark mass at\nthe center: a black hole. Using analytical Jeans models in combination with\nvarious Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the errors, we derive (with 68%\nconfidence limits) a best fit black-hole mass of $ (17 \\pm 9) \\times 10^3\nM_{\\odot}$ and a global mass-to-light ratio of $M/L_V = (1.6 \\pm 0.3) \\\nM_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 11:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The traditional approach to defining a local\nhardness index, by the derivative of the chemical potential with respect to the\nelectron density subject to the constraint of a fixed external potential, has\nraised several questions, and its chemical applicability has proved to be\nlimited. Here, we point out that the only actual possibility to obtain a local\nhardness measure in the traditional approach emerges if the external potential\nconstraint is dropped; consequently, utilizing the ambiguity of a restricted\nchemical potential derivative is not an option to gain alternative definitions\nof local hardness. At the same time, however, the arising local hardness\nconcept turns out to be fatally undermined by its inherent connection with the\nasymptotic value of the second derivative of the universal density functional.\nThe only other local hardness concept one may deduce from the traditional\ndefinition is the one that gives a constant value, the global hardness itself,\nthroughout an electron system in its ground state. Consequently, the\ntraditional approach is in principle incapable of delivering a local hardness\nindicator. The parallel case of defining a local version of the chemical\npotential itself is also outlined, arriving at a similar conclusion. Namely,\nthe only local chemical potential concept that can be gained from a definition\ndE[n]/dn(r)|v is the one that gives a constant, mu itself, for electron systems\nin their ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 12:20:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 12:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2011 16:37:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 13:09:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 17:19:20 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 08:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-05"}

An important case in which this approximation breaks down is during\nfrequency synthesis if the observing bandwidth is wide enough for variations in\nthe spectrum of the sky to become significant. The convolution assumption also\nbreaks down, in any situation but snapshot observations, if sources in the\nfield vary significantly in flux density over the duration of the observation.\nSuch time-variation can even be instrumental in nature, for example due to\njitter or rotation of the primary beam pattern on the sky during an\nobservation. An algorithm already exists for dealing with the spectral\nvariation encountered in wide-band frequency synthesis interferometry. This\nalgorithm is an extension of CLEAN in which, at each iteration, a set of N\n`dirty beams' are fitted and subtracted in parallel, instead of just a single\ndirty beam as in standard CLEAN. In the wide-band algorithm the beams are\nobtained by expanding a nominal source spectrum in a Taylor series, each term\nof the series generating one of the beams. In the present paper this algorithm\nis extended to images which contain sources which vary over both frequency and\ntime. Different expansion schemes (or bases) on the time and frequency axes are\ncompared, and issues such as Gibbs ringing and non-orthogonality are discussed.\nIt is shown that practical considerations make it often desirable to\northogonalize the set of beams before commencing the cleaning. This is easily\naccomplished via a Gram-Schmidt technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 14:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The model is based on pure luminosity evolution and adopts\nthe Dale & Helou SED templates. We find that the 850um source counts and their\nredshift distribution depend strongly on the shape of the luminosity evolution\nfunction, but only weakly on the details of the SEDs. We derive the best-fit\nevolutionary model using the 850um counts and redshift distribution as\nconstraints. Moreover our best-fit shows a flattening of the faint end of the\nluminosity function towards high redshifts and requires a colour evolution\nwhich implies the typical dust temperatures of objects with the same\nluminosities to decrease with redshift. We compare our best-fit model to\nobserved source counts at shorter and longer wavelengths which indicates our\nmodel reproduces the 70um and 1100um source counts remarkably well, but\nunder-produces the counts at intermediate wavelengths. Analysis reveals that\nthe discrepancy arises at low redshifts, indicating that revision of the\nadopted SED library towards lower dust temperatures (at a fixed infrared\nluminosity) is required.

In the case of\nvectorial matroids, a specific algorithm is reported whose time complexity is\nequal to O(N^2 M d^2), d being the rank of the matroid.

Different observational\nconstraints favor a nuclear origin for the gamma-ray emission. Here we present\na study of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the core of NGC 6251, and\ngive results of modeling in the one-zone synchrotron/SSC framework. The SSC\nmodel provides a good description of the radio to gamma-ray emission but, as\nfor other misaligned sources, predicts a lower Lorentz factor (\\Gamma~2.4) than\ntypically found when modeling blazars. If the blazar unification scenario is\ncorrect, this seems to point to the presence of at least two emitting regions\nin these objects, one with a higher and one with a lower Lorentz factor. The\nsolution of a structured jet, with a fast moving spine surrounded by a slow\nlayer, is explored and the consequences of the two models for the jet\nenergetics and evolution are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 15:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Different Markovian and non-Markovian\nenvironments are compared and efficient optimisation algorithms utilising\nanalytic gradient expressions and quasi-Newton updates are given for both\ncases. The performance of the algorithms is analysed for a large set of\nproblems in terms of the fidelities attained and the observed convergence\nbehaviour. New notions of success rate and success speed are introduced and\ndensity plots are utilised to study the effect of key parameters, such as gate\noperation times, and random variables, such as the initial fields required to\nstart the iterative algorithm. Core characteristics of the optimal fields are\nstatistically analysed. Substantial differences between Markovian and\nnon-Markovian environments in terms of the possibilities for control and the\ncontrol mechanisms are uncovered. In particular, in the Markovian case it is\nfound that the optimal fields obtained without considering the environment\ncannot be improved substantially by taking the environment into account and the\nfidelities attained are determined mostly by the gate operation time as well as\nthe overall strength of the environmental effects. Computation time is saved if\nthe fields are pre-optimised neglecting decoherence. In the non-Markovian case,\non the other hand, substantial improvements in the fidelities are observed when\nthe details of the system-bath coupling are taken into account. In that case,\nfield leakage is shown to be a significant issue which can make high gate\nfidelities impossible to obtain unless both the system and noise qubits are\nfully controlled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 11:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 May 2012 22:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-23"}
