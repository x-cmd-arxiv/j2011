Having motivated this model with\nnaturalness arguments, it is then necessary to check whether the experimentally\nallowed parameter space permits realisations of the model with low fine tuning.\nThe scope of this thesis is a study of naturalness of the electroweak physics\nin the minimal supergravity model. The latest experimental constraints are\napplied, and the fine tuning is quantitatively evaluated for a scan across the\nparameter space. The fine tuning of the electroweak scale is evaluated at\n2-loop order, and the fine tuning of the neutralino dark matter thermal relic\nenergy density is also determined. The natural regions of the parameter space\nare identified and the associated phenomenology relevant for detection\ndiscussed. Naturalness limits are also found for the parameter space and\nspectrum. The minimum fine tuning found is 1 part in 9 when dark matter\nconstraints are neglected, and 1 part in 15 when dark matter constraints are\nsatisfied. For both cases, the minimum fine tuning is found for a Higgs mass of\n115 GeV irrespective of whether the Higgs mass constraint is applied or not.\nThe most natural spectrum includes light superpartner fermions, and heavy\nsuperpartner scalars. Minimal supergravity currently remains viable with\nrespect to naturalness and a natural realisation may be discovered within the\nnext couple of years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2011 16:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}

While the directional motion\nis typically dictated by an external signal, the actual motility is also\nrestricted by physical constraints, such as the presence of other cells and the\nextracellular matrix. The ability to successfully navigate in the presence of\nobstacles is not only essential for organisms, but might prove relevant in the\nstudy of autonomous robotic motion.\n  Methodology/principal findings: We study a computational model of amoeboid\nchemotactic navigation under differing conditions, from motion in an\nobstacle-free environment to navigation between obstacles and finally to moving\nin a maze. We use the maze as a simple stand-in for a motion task with severe\nconstraints, as might be expected in dense extracellular matrix. Whereas agents\nusing simple chemotaxis can successfully navigate around small obstacles, the\npresence of large barriers can often lead to agent trapping. We further show\nthat employing a simple memory mechanism, namely secretion of a repulsive\nchemical by the agent, helps the agent escape from such trapping.\n  Conclusions/significance: Our main conclusion is that cells employing simple\nchemotactic strategies will often be unable to navigate through maze-like\ngeometries, but a simple chemical marker mechanism (which we refer to as\n\"self-assistance\") significantly improves success rates. This realization\nprovides important insights into mechanisms that might be employed by real\ncells migrating in complex environments as well as clues for the design of\nrobotic navigation strategies. The results can be extended to more complicated\nmulti-cellular systems and can be used in the study of mammalian cell migration\nand cancer metastasis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2011 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

To reduce the\nprobability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in self-defense\nmechanisms like antivirus and antispam software. However, such software does\nnot completely eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of\nresidual risk elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In reality,\nan Internet user faces risks due to security attacks as well as risks due to\nnon-security related failures (e.g., reliability faults in the form of hardware\ncrash, buffer overflow, etc.) . These risk types are often indistinguishable by\na naive user. However, a cyber-insurance agency would most likely insure risks\nonly due to security attacks. In this case, it becomes a challenge for an\nInternet user to choose the right type of cyber-insurance contract as standard\noptimal contracts, i.e., contracts under security attacks only, might prove to\nbe sub-optimal for himself.

We find that\nonly 48\\pm6 % of the C IV BLR emission is covered by the C I absorbing gas. We\nobserve residual light (~6 %) as well in the bottom of the O I {\\lambda}1302\nabsorption from the cloud, redshifted on top of the QSO Lyman-{\\alpha} emission\nline. Therefore the extent of the neutral phase of the absorbing cloud is not\nlarge enough to cover all of the background source. The most likely explanation\nfor this partial coverage is the small size of the intervening cloud, which is\ncomparable to the BLR size. We estimate the number densities in the cloud:\nn_H2~110 cm^{-3} for the H_2-bearing core and n_H ~30 cm^{-3} for the neutral\nenvelope. Given the column densities, N(H2)=(3.71\\pm0.97)\\times10^19 cm^{-2}\nand N(H I)=(7.94\\pm1.6)\\times10^20 cm^{-2}, we derive the linear size of the\nH_2-bearing core and the neutral envelope along the line of sight to be\nl_H2~0.15^{+0.05}_{-0.05} pc and l_HI~8.2^{+6.5}_{-4.1} pc, respectively. We\nestimate the size of the C IV BLR by two ways (i) extrapolating size-luminosity\nrelations derived from reverberation observations and (ii) assuming that the\nH_2-bearing core and the BLR are spherical in shape and the results are ~0.26\nand ~0.18 pc, respectively. The large size we derive for the extent of the\nneutral phase of the absorbing cloud together with a covering factor of ~0.94\nof the Lyman-{\\alpha} emission means that the Lyman-{\\alpha} BLR is probably\nfully covered but that the Lyman-{\\alpha} emission extends well beyond the\nlimits of the BLR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2011 22:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Simulations show\nthat the formation of aggregation-prone structures (N$^*$) similar to the\nstructure in the fibril requires overcoming high desolvation barrier. The\nmechanism of protofilament formation in a polar Sup35 peptide fragment\nillustrates that water dramatically slows down self-assembly. Release of water\ntrapped in the pores as water wires creates protofilament with a dry interface.\nSimilarly, one of the main driving force for addition of a solvated monomer to\na preformed fibril is the entropy gain of released water.\n  We conclude by postulating that two-step model for protein crystallization\nmust also hold for higher order amyloid structure formation starting from\nN$^*$. Multiple N$^*$ structures with varying water content results in a number\nof distinct water-laden polymorphic structures. In predominantly hydrophobic\nsequences, water accelerates fibril formation.

This result holds for all\nfading channel models with continuous distribution functions. Secondly, the\nresulting optimum threshold selection problem is analyzed in detail. This is a\nnon-convex optimization problem over finite dimensional Euclidean spaces. By\nutilizing the theory of majorization, an underlying Schur-concave structure in\nthe sum-rate function is identified, and the sufficient conditions for the\noptimality of homogenous threshold feedback policies are obtained. Applications\nof these results are illustrated for well known fading channel models such as\nRayleigh, Nakagami and Rician fading channels, along with various engineering\nand design insights. Rather surprisingly, it is shown that using the same\nthreshold value at all mobile users is not always a rate-wise optimal feedback\nstrategy, even for a network with identical mobile users experiencing\nstatistically the same channel conditions.

After 4x4 binning of the HST/ACS images to secure a sufficient\nsignal-to-noise ratio for each pixel, we derive several quantities describing\nthe pixel color-magnitude diagram (pCMD) of NGC 5194: blue/red color cut, red\npixel sequence parameters, blue pixel sequence parameters and blue-to-red pixel\nratio. The red sequence pixels are mostly older than 1 Gyr, while the blue\nsequence pixels are mostly younger than 1 Gyr, in their luminosity-weighted\nmean stellar ages. The color variation in the red pixel sequence from V = 20\nmag arcsec^(-2) to V = 17 mag arcsec^(-2) corresponds to a metallicity\nvariation of \\Delta[Fe/H] ~ 2 or an optical depth variation of \\Delta\\tau_V ~ 4\nby dust, but the actual sequence is thought to originate from the combination\nof those two effects. At V < 20 mag arcsec^(-2), the color variation in the\nblue pixel sequence corresponds to an age variation from 5 Myr to 300 Myr under\nthe assumption of solar metallicity and \\tau_V = 1. To investigate the spatial\ndistributions of stellar populations, we divide pixel stellar populations using\nthe pixel color-color diagram and population synthesis models.

We compare the impact of both the magnetic field\nand the wind anisotropy to the benchmark case of a purely hydrodynamical (HD)\ninteraction of isotropic winds, which has been studied in detail by Bogovalov\net al. (2008). We consider the interaction in axisymmetric approximation, i.e.\nthe pulsar rotation axis is assumed to be oriented along the line between the\npulsar and the optical star and the effects related to the pulsar orbiting are\nneglected. The impact of the magnetic field is studied for the case of weak\nmagnetization (with magnetization parameter $\\sigma<0.1$), which is consistent\nwith conventional models of pulsar winds. The effects related to anisotropy in\npulsar winds are modeled assuming that the kinetic energy flux in a\nnon-magnetized pulsar wind is strongly anisotropic, with the minimum at the\npulsar rotation axis and the maximum in the perpendicular direction. We show\nthat, although both considered effects change the shape of the region occupied\nby the terminated pulsar wind, their impact appears to be small. In particular,\nfor the magnetization of the pulsar wind below 0.1, the magnetic field pressure\nremains well below the plasma pressure in the post-shock region. Thus, in the\ncase of interaction of a pulsar with the stellar wind environment (opposite to\nthe case of plerions, i.e. the pulsar interaction with the interstellar medium,\nwhen the magnetic field becomes dynamically important independently on the wind\nmagnetization) the HD approach represents a feasible approximation for\nnumerical modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 03:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We use simultaneous measurements of the\nactive planet host star HD189733 with high-precision optical photometry by the\nMOST satellite and high-resolution spectra by SOPHIE. We apply on this unique\ndataset a spot model to predict the activity-induced RV variations and compare\nthem with the observed ones. The model is based on the rotational modulation of\nthe stellar flux. A maximum entropy regularization is applied to find a unique\nand stable solution for the distribution of the active regions versus stellar\nlongitude. The RV variations are synthesized considering the effects on the\nline profiles of the brightness perturbations due to dark spots and bright\nfaculae and the reduction of the convective blueshifts in the active regions.\nThe synthesized RV time series shows a remarkably good agreement with the\nobserved one although variations on timescales shorter than 4-5 days cannot be\nreproduced by our model. Persistent active longitudes are revealed by the spot\nmodelling. They rotate with slightly different periods yielding a minimum\nrelative amplitude of the differential rotation of \\Delta \\Omega / \\Omega =\n0.23 \\pm 0.10. The method proves capable of reducing the power of the\nactivity-induced RV variations by a factor from 2 to 10 at the rotation\nfrequency and its harmonics up to the third. Thanks to the high-precision\nspace-borne photometry delivered by CoRoT, Kepler, or later PLATO, it is\npossible to map the longitudinal distribution of active regions in late-type\nstars and apply the method presented in this paper to reduce remarkably the\nimpact of stellar activity on their RV jitter allowing us to confirm the\ndetection of low-mass planets or refine the measurement of their mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 08:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Thus, usual\ndietary intake is assessed with considerable measurement error. Also, diet\nrepresents numerous foods, nutrients and other components, each of which have\ndistinctive attributes. Sometimes, it is useful to examine intake of these\ncomponents separately, but increasingly nutritionists are interested in\nexploring them collectively to capture overall dietary patterns. Consumption of\nthese components varies widely: some are consumed daily by almost everyone on\nevery day, while others are episodically consumed so that 24-hour recall data\nare zero-inflated. In addition, they are often correlated with each other.\nFinally, it is often preferable to analyze the amount of a dietary component\nrelative to the amount of energy (calories) in a diet because dietary\nrecommendations often vary with energy level. The quest to understand overall\ndietary patterns of usual intake has to this point reached a standstill. There\nare no statistical methods or models available to model such complex\nmultivariate data with its measurement error and zero inflation. This paper\nproposes the first such model, and it proposes the first workable solution to\nfit such a model.

The reason for this\nincompleteness is twofold: i) insufficient network coverage and ii) data\naggregation for energy saving. Whereas the existing recovery schemes only\ntackle the second aspect, we develop Dual-lEvel Compressed Aggregation (DECA)\nas a novel framework to address both aspects. Specifically, DECA allows a high\nfidelity recovery of a widespread event, under the situations that the WSN only\nsparsely covers the event area and that an in-network data aggregation is\napplied for traffic reduction. Exploiting both the low-rank nature of\nreal-world events and the redundancy in sensory data, DECA combines matrix\ncompletion with a fine-tuned compressed sensing technique to conduct a\ndual-level reconstruction process. We demonstrate that DECA can recover a\nwidespread event with less than 5% of the data, with respect to the dimension\nof the event, being collected.

The Moon shadow is an important\ntool to determine the performance of an air shower array. Indeed, the westward\ndisplacement of the shadow center, due to the bending effect of the geomagnetic\nfield on the propagation of cosmic rays, allows the setting of the absolute\nrigidity scale of the primary particles inducing the showers recorded by the\ndetector. In addition, the shape of the shadow permits to determine the\ndetector point spread function, while the position of the deficit at high\nenergies allows the evaluation of its absolute pointing accuracy.\n  In this paper we present the observation of the cosmic ray Moon shadowing\neffect carried out by the ARGO-YBJ experiment in the multi-TeV energy region\nwith high statistical significance (55 standard deviations).

The stability of the detector on a monthly basis has been checked by\nmonitoring the position and the deficit of the Moon shadow.

The structural analysis of the layers by high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy and by high-resolution- and synchrotron x-ray\ndiffraction gives evidence of the fact that in the case of homogenous-Mg\ndoping, Mg and Fe competitively occupy the Ga-substitutional cation sites,\nreducing the efficiency of Fe incorporation. Accordingly, the character of the\nmagnetization is modified from ferromagnetic-like in the non-codoped films to\nparamagnetic in the case of homogeneous Mg codoping. The findings are discussed\nvis-`a-vis theoretical results obtained by ab initio computations, showing only\na weak effect of codoping on the pairing energy of two Fe cations in bulk GaN.\nHowever, according to these computations, codoping reverses the sign of the\nparing energy of Fe cations at the Ga-rich surface, substantiating the view\nthat the Fe aggregation occurs at the growth surface. In contrast to the\nhomogenous deposition mode, the digital one is found to remarkably promote the\naggregation of the magnetic ions. The Fe-rich nanocrystals formed in this way\nare distributed non-uniformly, giving reason for the observed deviation from a\nstandard superparamagnetic behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 11:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The second example illustrates the failure of controlling the\ndissociation dynamics of a driven Morse oscillator due to the phenomenon of\nresonance-assisted tunneling.

For\nexample, in a typical online retail application, skyline queries can help\ncustomers select the most interesting, among a pool of available, products.\nRecently, reverse skyline queries have been proposed, highlighting the\nmanufacturer's perspective, i.e. how to determine the expected buyers of a\ngiven product. In this work we develop novel algorithms for two important\nclasses of queries involving customer preferences. We first propose a novel\nalgorithm, termed as RSA, for answering reverse skyline queries. We then\nintroduce a new type of queries, namely the k-Most Attractive Candidates k-MAC\nquery. In this type of queries, given a set of existing product specifications\nP, a set of customer preferences C and a set of new candidate products Q, the\nk-MAC query returns the set of k candidate products from Q that jointly\nmaximizes the total number of expected buyers, measured as the cardinality of\nthe union of individual reverse skyline sets (i.e., influence sets). Applying\nexisting approaches to solve this problem would require calculating the reverse\nskyline set for each candidate, which is prohibitively expensive for large data\nsets. We, thus, propose a batched algorithm for this problem and compare its\nperformance against a branch-and-bound variant that we devise. Both of these\nalgorithms use in their core variants of our RSA algorithm. Our experimental\nstudy using both synthetic and real data sets demonstrates that our proposed\nalgorithms outperform existing, or naive solutions to our studied classes of\nqueries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 12:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The spectra were acquired with the ARCES \\'{e}chelle spectrograph R\n= 38,000 on the 3.5-m telescope at the Apache Point Observatory. Additional\nspectra taken with STIS were acquired from the Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) and\nwere used to independently confirm the spatial origin of the spectral features.\nThe profile of a single D-line consists of double-peaked emission, red-shifted\nabsorption and blue-shifted absorption. We find that the double-peaked emission\noriginates from the bipolar outflow, the red-shifted absorption feature is due\nto the photospheric line, and the blue-shifted absorption arises from the\nbipolar outflow as seen against the photosphere of the luminous post-AGB\ncomponent in HD 44179. In order to better understand the Na I D-line profile,\nwe examined the periodically variable asymmetric photospheric absorption lines.\nThe asymmetric lines are interpreted as a signature of slow self-accretion\nfollowing enhanced mass-loss around periastron. An empirical model was\nconstructed to remove the photospheric component from the Na I D-line profile\nin order to study the nebular emission and absorption of sodium along the\nline-of-sight to the primary. This paper also discusses the different origins\nof the single-peaked emission, the double-peaked emission and the blue-shifted\nand red-shifted absorption components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 14:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Physiological concentrations realized in such small\nvolumes imply low copy numbers of interacting molecules with the consequence of\nconsiderable fluctuations in the concentrations. In contrast, rate equation\nmodels are based on the implicit assumption of infinitely large numbers of\ninteracting molecules, or equivalently, that reactions occur in infinite\nvolumes at constant macroscopic concentrations. In this article we compute the\nfinite-volume corrections (or equivalently the finite copy number corrections)\nto the solutions of the rate equations for chemical reaction networks composed\nof arbitrarily large numbers of enzyme-catalyzed reactions which are confined\ninside a small sub-cellular compartment. This is achieved by applying a\nmesoscopic version of the quasi-steady state assumption to the exact\nFokker-Planck equation associated with the Poisson Representation of the\nchemical master equation. The procedure yields impressively simple and compact\nexpressions for the finite-volume corrections. We prove that the predictions of\nthe rate equations will always underestimate the actual steady-state substrate\nconcentrations for an enzyme-reaction network confined in a small volume. In\nparticular we show that the finite-volume corrections increase with decreasing\nsub-cellular volume, decreasing Michaelis-Menten constants and increasing\nenzyme saturation. The magnitude of the corrections depends sensitively on the\ntopology of the network. The predictions of the theory are shown to be in\nexcellent agreement with stochastic simulations for two types of networks\ntypically associated with protein methylation and metabolism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 14:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}

Our sample contains the\nbrightest 173 AGNs in these bands above declination -30 deg. during this\nperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray to\nradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. The latter\nquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range of\nspectral energy distribution (SED) parameters in the bright blazar population.\nThe BL Lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasing\ngamma-ray loudness with synchrotron SED peak frequency, suggesting a universal\nSED shape for objects of this class. The synchrotron self-Compton model is\nfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these BL Lacs over external seed photon\nmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of Compton dominance on Doppler\nfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron SED peak - gamma-ray\nloudness correlation. The high-synchrotron peaked (HSP) BL Lac objects are\ndistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, and\nnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarization\nlevels. No equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars\n(FSRQ) in our sample. Given the association of such properties with\nrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the HSP BL Lacs have generally lower\nDoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked BL Lacs or FSRQs in our\nsample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 15:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 16:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Targeted stellar models\nwere computed in order to investigate the impact of that rate in the mass range\nof 0.8 < M / Msun < 25 and in the metallicity range between Z = 0 and Z = 0.02.\nThe revised rate has a significant impact on the evolution of low- and\nintermediate-mass stars, while its influence on the evolution of massive stars\n(M >~ 10 Msun) is minimal. We find that employing the revised rate suppresses\nhelium shell flashes on AGB phase for stars in the initial mass range 0.8 < M /\nMsun < 6, which is contradictory to what is observed. The absence of helium\nshell flashes is due to the weak temperature dependence of the revised\ntriple-alpha reaction cross section at the temperature involved. In our models,\nit is suggested that the temperature dependence of the cross section should\nhave at least nu > 10 at T = 1 - 1.2 x 10^8 K where the cross section is\nproportional to T^{nu}. We also derive the helium ignition curve to estimate\nthe maximum cross section to retain the low-mass first red giants. The\nsemi-analytically derived ignition curves suggest that the reaction rate should\nbe less than ~ 10^{-29} cm^6 s^{-1} mole^{-2} at ~ 10^{7.8} K, which\ncorresponds to about three orders of magnitude larger than that of the NACRE\ncompilation. In an effort to compromise with the revised rates, we calculate\nand analyze models with enhanced CNO cycle reaction rates to increase the\nmaximum luminosity of the first giant branch. However, it is impossible to\nreach the typical RGB tip luminosity even if all the reaction rates related to\nCNO cycles are enhanced by more than ten orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 15:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Following a concise computational\nprocess, we tentatively identify four new hypothetical planetary positions\ngiven as 0.081, 0.41, 1.51 and 2.95 AU from the star. The likelihood that these\npositions are occupied by real existing planets is significantly enhanced for\nthe positions of 1.51 and 2.95 AU in the view of previous simulations on planet\nformation and planetary orbital stability.
