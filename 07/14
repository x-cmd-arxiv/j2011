Furthermore, an extraordinary high zenith angle\nwas found for the penumbral downflows. The small-scale velocity field within\npenumbral filaments is investigated both by statistics and case studies. The\noutcome of these surveys confirms the predictions of penumbral flux-tube\nmodels. Additionally, bright penumbral downflows as well as two families of\npenumbral filaments are studied.

We also analyze both the harmonic map heatflow and Schrodinger\nmap flow limit cases. All asymptotic results are verified by detailed numerical\nexperiments, as well as a robust topological argument. The key result of this\npaper is that blowup solutions to these problems are co-dimension one and hence\nboth unstable and non-generic. Solutions permitted to deviate from radial\nsymmetry remain global for all time but may, for suitable initial data,\napproach arbitrarily close to blowup. A careful asymptotic analysis of\nsolutions near blowup shows that finite-time blowup corresponds to a saddle\nfixed point in a low dimensional dynamical system. Radial symmetry precludes\nmotion anywhere but on the stable manifold towards blowup. A similar scenario\nemerges in the equivariant setting: blowup is unstable. To be more precise,\nblowup is co-dimension one both within the equivariant symmetry class and in\nthe unrestricted class of initial data. The value of the parameter in the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation plays a very subdued role in the analysis of\nequivariant blowup, leading to identical blowup rates and spatial scales for\nall parameter values. One notable exception is the angle between solution in\ninner scale (which bubbles off) and outer scale (which remains), which does\ndepend on parameter values. Analyzing near-blowup solutions, we find that in\nthe inner scale these solution quickly rotate over an angle {\\pi}. As a\nconsequence, for the blowup solution it is natural to consider a continuation\nscenario after blowup where one immediately re-attaches a sphere (thus\nrestoring the energy lost in blowup), yet rotated over an angle {\\pi}. This\ncontinuation is natural since it leads to continuous dependence on initial\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 18:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-14"}

Emotions are known to be important in affecting interaction partners\nin offline communication in many ways. Could emotions in Internet exchanges\naffect others and systematically influence quantitative and qualitative aspects\nof the trajectory of e-communities? The development of automatic sentiment\nanalysis has made large scale emotion detection and analysis possible using\ntext messages collected from the web. It is not clear if emotions in\ne-communities primarily derive from individual group members' personalities or\nif they result from intra-group interactions, and whether they influence group\nactivities. We show the collective character of affective phenomena on a large\nscale as observed in 4 million posts downloaded from Blogs, Digg and BBC\nforums. To test whether the emotions of a community member may influence the\nemotions of others, posts were grouped into clusters of messages with similar\nemotional valences. The frequency of long clusters was much higher than it\nwould be if emotions occurred at random. Distributions for cluster lengths can\nbe explained by preferential processes because conditional probabilities for\nconsecutive messages grow as a power law with cluster length. For BBC forum\nthreads, average discussion lengths were higher for larger values of absolute\naverage emotional valence in the first ten comments and the average amount of\nemotion in messages fell during discussions. Our results prove that collective\nemotional states can be created and modulated via Internet communication and\nthat emotional expressiveness is the fuel that sustains some e-communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 19:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-29"}

The central tenet of this model,\ndifferent from many of the earlier models, is that the star-formation in Lya\nemitters is proportional to the mass accretion rate rather than the total halo\nmass. We find that at z~3, nearly 35% of the Lya emitters accrete their mass\nthrough major (3:1) mergers, and this fraction increases to about 50% at z~7.\nThis imply that the star-formation in a large fraction of high-redshift Lya\nemitters is driven by mergers.

Our sample consists of 146 UV-selected galaxies with\nspectroscopic redshifts 1.5<z<2.6 in the GOODS-North field. Supplemented with\ndeep Very Large Array (VLA) and Spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks at\nthe positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 GHz. The\ncomparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates and\ncalibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with UV luminosities\nL(UV)>1e10 Lsun at z~2 are luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with a median\nL(IR)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 Lsun. Typical galaxies at 1.5<z<2.6 have a median dust\nobscuration L(IR)/L(UV) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correction\nfactor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (SFR) from the\nunobscured UV SFR, of 5.2+/-0.6. This result is similar to that inferred from\nprevious investigations of the UV, H-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and X-ray\nproperties of the same galaxies studied here. Stacking in bins of UV slope\nimplies that L* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and that\nthe correlation between UV slope and dustiness is similar to that found for\nlocal starburst galaxies. Hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxes\nvalidate on average the use of the local UV attenuation curve to recover the\ndust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In the\nsimplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift UV\nattenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar and\ndust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 20:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Here, we use the\nsource catalogue from the Planck Early Data Release to test further the WMAP\nbeam profiles. We confirm that stacked beam profiles at Q, V and particularly\nat W appear wider than expected when compared to the Jupiter beam, normalised\neither directly to the radio source profiles or using Planck fluxes. The same\nresult is also found based on WMAP-CMBfree source catalogues and NVSS sources.\nThe accuracy of our beam profile measurements is supported by analysis of CMB\nsky simulations. However the beam profiles from WMAP7 at the W band are\nnarrower than previously found in WMAP5 data and the rejection of the WMAP beam\nis now only at the ~3sigma level. We also find that the WMAP source fluxes\ndemonstrate possible non-linearity with Planck fluxes. But including\nground-based and Planck data for the bright Weiland et al (2011) sources may\nsuggest that the discrepancy is a linear offset rather than a non-linearity.\nAdditionally, we find that the stacked Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) decrements of\n~151 galaxy clusters observed by Planck are in agreement with the WMAP data. We\nfind that there is no evidence for a WMAP SZ deficit as has previously been\nreported. In the particular case of Coma we find evidence for the presence of\nan ~0.1mK downwards CMB fluctuation.

For any amplifier, that quantum noise is\ncompletely characterized by the attributes of the system regarded as a\nclassical amplifier, and arises out of those classical amplification factors\nand the commutation relations of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 20:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-15"}

We present new\ncertificates that are based on a combinatorial characterization for\nlocal-optimality of a codeword in irregular Tanner codes with respect to any\nMBIOS channel. This characterization is based on a conical combination of\nnormalized weighted subtrees in the computation trees of the Tanner graph.\nThese subtrees may have any finite height h (even equal or greater than half of\nthe girth of the Tanner graph). In addition, the degrees of local-code nodes in\nthese subtrees are not restricted to two. We prove that local optimality in\nthis new characterization implies maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality and LP\noptimality, and show that a certificate can be computed efficiently.\n  We also present a new message-passing iterative decoding algorithm, called\nnormalized weighted min-sum (NWMS). NWMS decoding is a BP-type algorithm that\napplies to any irregular binary Tanner code with single parity-check local\ncodes. We prove that if a locally-optimal codeword with respect to height\nparameter h exists (whereby notably h is not limited by the girth of the Tanner\ngraph), then NWMS decoding finds this codeword in h iterations. The decoding\nguarantee of the NWMS decoding algorithm applies whenever there exists a\nlocally optimal codeword. Because local optimality of a codeword implies that\nit is the unique ML codeword, the decoding guarantee also provides an ML\ncertificate for this codeword.\n  Finally, we apply the new local optimality characterization to regular Tanner\ncodes, and prove lower bounds on the noise thresholds of LP decoding in MBIOS\nchannels. When the noise is below these lower bounds, the probability that LP\ndecoding fails decays doubly exponentially in the girth of the Tanner graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 20:55:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2011 15:48:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 20:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 12:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}

Errors in state estimation for these\noften highly nonlinear systems has been the primary focus of recent research,\nbut as that error has been successfully diminished, the role of model error in\nforecast uncertainty has duly increased. The present study is an investigation\nof a particular empirical correction procedure that is of special interest\nbecause it considers the model a \"black box\", and therefore can be applied\nwidely with little modification. The procedure involves the comparison of short\nmodel forecasts with a reference \"truth\" system during a training period in\norder to calculate systematic (1) state-independent model bias and (2)\nstate-dependent error patterns. An estimate of the likelihood of the latter\nerror component is computed from the current state at every timestep of model\nintegration. The effectiveness of this technique is explored in two\nexperiments: (1) a perfect model scenario, in which models have the same\nstructure and dynamics as the true system, differing only in parameter values;\nand (2) a more realistic scenario, in which models are structurally different\n(in dynamics, dimension, and parameterization) from the target system. In each\ncase, the results suggest that the correction procedure is more effective for\nreducing error and prolonging forecast usefulness than parameter tuning.\nHowever, the cost of this increase in average forecast accuracy is the creation\nof substantial qualitative differences between the dynamics of the corrected\nmodel and the true system. A method to mitigate the structural damage caused by\nempirical correction and further increase forecast accuracy is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 22:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-08"}

We prove that,\nunder certain conditions, hard problems cannot even be approximated in any\nreasonable complexity bound --- i.e., even with a large amount of time, having\na solution to a very similar graph does not help in computing a solution to the\ncurrent graph. To achieve this, we formalize the idea as a maintenance\nalgorithm.

It\nis necessary to enhance existing data warehousing system to increase the data\nquality. It results in the storage of high quality data in the repository and\nefficient decision making. In this paper a Quality Evaluation Framework is\nproposed keeping in view the quality dimensions associated with different\nphases of a web warehouse. Further more, the proposed framework is validated\nempirically with the help of quantitative analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 05:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-15"}

We use a new, comprehensive classification scheme\nbased on radio, far- and near-IR, optical, and X-ray data to disentangle\nstar-forming galaxies from AGN and radio-quiet from radio-loud AGN. We confirm\nour previous result that star-forming galaxies become dominant only below 0.1\nmJy. The sub-mJy radio sky turns out to be a complex mix of star-forming\ngalaxies and radio-quiet AGN evolving at a similar, strong rate; non-evolving\nlow-luminosity radio galaxies; and declining radio powerful (P > 3 10^24 W/Hz)\nAGN. Our results suggest that radio emission from radio-quiet AGN is closely\nrelated to star formation. The detection of compact, high brightness\ntemperature cores in several nearby radio-quiet AGN can be explained by the\nco-existence of two components, one non-evolving and AGN-related and one\nevolving and star-formation-related. Radio-quiet AGN are an important class of\nsub-mJy sources, accounting for ~30% of the sample and ~60% of all AGN, and\noutnumbering radio-loud AGN at < 0.1 mJy.

We show that the original\nLaplace deconvolution problem can be reduced to nonparametric estimation of a\nregression function and its derivatives on the interval of growing length T_n.\nWhereas the forms of the estimators remain standard, the choices of the\nparameters and the minimax convergence rates, which are expressed in terms of\nT_n^2/n in this case, are affected by the asymptotic growth of the length of\nthe interval.\n  We derive an adaptive kernel estimator of the function of interest, and\nestablish its asymptotic minimaxity over a range of Sobolev classes. We\nillustrate the theory by examples of construction of explicit expressions of\nLaplace deconvolution estimators. A simulation study shows that, in addition to\nproviding asymptotic optimality as the number of observations turns to\ninfinity, the proposed estimator demonstrates good performance in finite sample\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 09:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2012 10:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 17:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

The corotation torque has recently received detailed\nattention as it may slow down, stall, or reverse migration. In laminar viscous\ndisc models, the long-term evolution of the corotation torque is intimately\nrelated to viscous and thermal diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe\nregion. This paper examines the properties of the corotation torque in discs\nwhere MHD turbulence develops as a result of the magnetorotational instability,\nconsidering a weak initial toroidal magnetic field. We present results of 3D\nMHD simulations carried out with two different codes. Non-ideal MHD effects and\nthe disc's vertical stratification are neglected, and locally isothermal disc\nmodels are considered. The running time-averaged torque exerted by the disc on\na fixed planet is evaluated in three disc models. We first present results with\nan inner disc cavity (planet trap). As in viscous disc models, the planet is\nfound to experience a positive running time-averaged torque over several\nhundred orbits, which highlights the existence of an unsaturated corotation\ntorque maintained in the long term in MHD turbulent discs. Two disc models with\ninitial power-law density and temperature profiles are also adopted, in which\nthe time-averaged torque is found to be in decent agreement with its\ncounterpart in laminar viscous disc models with similar viscosity at the planet\nlocation. Detailed analysis of the averaged torque density distributions\nindicates that the differential Lindblad torque takes very similar values in\nMHD turbulent and laminar viscous discs, and there exists an unsaturated\ncorotation torque in MHD turbulent discs. This analysis also reveals the\nexistence of an additional corotation torque in weakly magnetized discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 10:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In order to model the evolution of real\nsystems, many growing network models have been proposed to reproduce some\nspecific topology properties. As the structure strongly influences the network\nfunction, designing the function-aimed growing strategy is also a significant\ntask with many potential applications. In this letter, we focus on\nsynchronization in the growing networks. In order to enhance the\nsynchronizability during the network evolution, we propose the Spectral-Based\nGrowing (SBG) strategy. Based on the linear stability analysis of\nsynchronization, we show that our growing mechanism yields better\nsynchronizability than the existing topology-aimed growing strategies in both\nartificial and real-world networks. We also observe that there is an optimal\ndegree of new added nodes, which means adding nodes with neither too large nor\ntoo low degree could enhance the synchronizability. Furthermore, some topology\nmeasurements are considered in the resultant networks. The results show that\nthe degree, node betweenness centrality from SBG strategy are more homogenous\nthan those from other growing strategies.

Starting from the differential equation point of view the\nstochastic model is identified by its Kolmogorov equations, which is a system\nof linear ODEs that depends on the state space size ($N$) and can be written as\n$\\dot u_N=A_N u_N$. Our results rely on the convergence of the transition\nmatrices $A_N$ to an operator $A$. This convergence also implies that the\nsolutions $u_N$ converge to the solution $u$ of $\\dot u=Au$. The limiting ODE\ncan be easily used to derive simpler mean-field-type models such that the\nmoments of the stochastic process will converge uniformly to the solution of\nappropriately chosen mean-field equations. A bi-product of this method is the\nproof that the rate of convergence is $\\mathcal{O}(1/N)$. In addition, it turns\nout that the proof holds for cases that are slightly more general than the\nusual density dependent one. Moreover, for Markov chains where the transition\nrates satisfy some sign conditions, a new approach for proving convergence to\nthe mean-field limit is proposed. The starting point in this case is the\nderivation of a countable system of ordinary differential equations for all the\nmoments. This is followed by the proof of a perturbation theorem for this\ninfinite system, which in turn leads to an estimate for the difference between\nthe moments and the corresponding quantities derived from the solution of the\nmean-field ODE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 13:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 08:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-19"}

Methods: We present first the results of the timing and spectral\nanalysis of all the X-ray observations of IGR J11014-6103 carried out with\nROSAT, ASCA, Einstein, Swift, and XMM-Newton, and then use them to search for\npossible counterparts to the source in the optical, infra-red, radio and\ngamma-ray domain.

In computational models of neuronal systems, the transition\nfrom spiking to bursting often exhibits complex bifurcation structure. One type\nof transition involves the torus canard, which was originally observed in a\nsimple biophysical model of a Purkinje cell. In this article, we expand on that\noriginal result by showing that torus canards arise in a broad array of\nwell-known computational neuronal models with three different classes of\nbursting dynamics: sub-Hopf/fold cycle bursting, circle/fold cycle bursting,\nand fold/fold cycle bursting. The essential features that these models share\nare multiple time scales leading naturally to decomposition into slow and fast\nsystems, a saddle-node of periodic orbits in the fast system, and a torus\nbifurcation in the full system. We show that the transition from spiking to\nbursting in each model system is given by an explosion of torus canards. Based\non these examples, as well as on emerging theory, we propose that torus canards\nare a common dynamic phenomenon separating the regimes of spiking and bursting\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 14:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-15"}

After an outline of the problems affecting our knowledge of the Li\ncontent in low-mass stars (M<3Mo), we discuss deep-mixing models for the RGB\nstages suitable to account for the observed trends and for the correlated\nvariations of the carbon isotope ratio; we find that Li destruction in these\nphases is limited to masses below about 2.3 Mo. Subsequently, we concentrate on\nthe final stages of evolution for both O-rich and C-rich AGB stars. Here, the\nconstraints on extra-mixing phenomena previously derived from heavier nuclei\n(from C to Al), coupled to recent updates in stellar structure models\n(including both the input physics and the set of reaction rates used), are\nsuitable to account for the observations of Li abundances below A(Li)= log\ne(Li) = 1.5 (and sometimes more). Also their relations with other\nnucleosynthesis signatures of AGB phases (like the abundance of F, the C/O and\n12C/13C ratios) can be explained. This requires generally moderate efficiencies\n(\\dot M <= 0.3 - 0.5 x 10^-6 Mo/yr) for non-convective mass transport. At such\nrates, slow extra-mixing does not modify remarkably Li abundances in early-AGB\nphases; on the other hand, faster mixing encounters a physical limit in\ndestroying Li, set by the mixing velocity. Beyond this limit, Li starts to be\nproduced; therefore its destruction on the AGB is modest. Li is then\nsignificantly produced by the third dredge up. We also show that effective\ncirculation episodes, while not destroying Li, would easily bring the 12C/13C\nratios to equilibrium, contrary to the evidence in most AGB stars, and would\nburn F beyond the limits shown by C(N) giants. Hence, we do not confirm the\ncommon idea that efficient extra-mixing drastically reduces the Li content of\nC-stars with respect to K-M giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 15:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This choice is motivated by the fact\nthat, basically, we do not know the position in the sky of the spin axis of the\nSBH in Sgr A* with sufficient accuracy. We apply our results to S2, which is\nthe closest star discovered so far having an orbital period P_b = 15.98 yr, and\nto a hypothetical closer star X with P_b = 0.5 yr. Our calculations are quite\ngeneral, not being related to any specific parameterization of k, and can be\napplied also to astrophysical binary systems, stellar planetary systems, and\nplanetary satellite geodesy in which different reference frames, generally not\naligned with the primary's rotational axis, are routinely used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 08:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 15:24:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 14:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 19:44:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 16:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 22:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

With carefully selected parameters, in an external cavity diode\nlaser system, we observe second-order phase transition with multiple (three or\nfour) thresholds in the measured power-current-temperature three dimensional\nphase diagram. Such controlled death and revival of second-order phase\ntransition sheds new insight into the nature of ubiquitous second-order phase\ntransition. Our theory and experiment show that the single threshold\nsecond-order phase transition is only a special case of the more general\nmulti-threshold second-order phase transition, which is an even richer\nphenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 14:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-22"}
