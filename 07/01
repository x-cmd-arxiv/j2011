Changes in the photospheric appearance of the sunspots are\ndriven by subsurface flows in several Mm depth. Most of magnetic field is\npushed into a downflow vertex of the subsurface convection pattern, while some\nfraction of the flux separates from the main trunk of the spot. Flux separation\nin deeper layers is accompanied in the photosphere with light bridge formation\nin the early stages and formation of pores separating from the spot at later\nstages. Over a time scale of less than a day we see the development of a large\nscale flow pattern surrounding the sunspots, which is dominated by a radial\noutflow reaching about 50% of the convective rms velocity in amplitude. Several\ncomponents of the large scale flow are found to be independent from the\npresence of a penumbra and the associated Evershed flow. While the simulated\nsunspots lead to blockage of heat flux in the near surface layers, we do not\nsee compelling evidence for a brightness enhancement in their periphery.

We employ an approximate treatment of neutrino transport. Due to the\nexcision of the high-density core of the proto-neutron star and the use of an\naxis-free overset grid, the models can be followed from the post-bounce\naccretion phase for more than one second without imposing any symmetry\nrestrictions. GW and neutrino emission exhibit the generic time-dependent\nfeatures known from 2D models. Non-radial hydrodynamic mass motions in the\naccretion layer and their interaction with the outer layers of the\nproto-neutron star together with anisotropic neutrino emission give rise to a\nGW signal with an amplitude of ~5-20 cm and frequencies 100--500 Hz. The GW\nemission from mass motions reaches a maximum before the explosion sets in.\nAfterwards the GW signal exhibits a low-frequency modulation, in some cases\ndescribing a quasi-monotonic growth, associated with the non-spherical\nexpansion of the explosion shock wave and the large-scale anisotropy of the\nescaping neutrino flow. Variations of the mass-quadrupole moment due to\nconvective activity inside the nascent neutron star contribute a high-frequency\ncomponent to the GW signal during the post-explosion phase. The GW signals\nexhibit strong variability between the two polarizations, different explosion\nsimulations and different observer directions, and does not possess any\ntemplate character. The neutrino emission properties show fluctuations over the\nneutron star surface on spatial and temporal scales that reflect the different\ntypes of non-spherical mass motions. The modulation amplitudes of the\nmeasurable neutrino luminosities and mean energies are significantly smaller\nthan predicted by 2D simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 16:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 13:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Elimination-based\nconcurrent data-structures allow operations with reverse semantics (such as\npush and pop stack operations) to \"collide\" and exchange values without having\nto access a central location. Software combining, on the other hand, is\neffective when colliding operations have identical semantics: when a pair of\nthreads performing operations with identical semantics collide, the task of\nperforming the combined set of operations is delegated to one of the threads\nand the other thread waits for its operation(s) to be performed. Applying this\nmechanism iteratively can reduce memory contention and increase throughput. The\nmost highly scalable prior concurrent stack algorithm is the\nelimination-backoff stack. The elimination-backoff stack provides high\nparallelism for symmetric workloads in which the numbers of push and pop\noperations are roughly equal, but its performance deteriorates when workloads\nare asymmetric. We present DECS, a novel Dynamic Elimination-Combining Stack\nalgorithm, that scales well for all workload types. While maintaining the\nsimplicity and low-overhead of the elimination-bakcoff stack, DECS manages to\nbenefit from collisions of both identical- and reverse-semantics operations.\nOur empirical evaluation shows that DECS scales significantly better than both\nblocking and non-blocking best prior stack algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 17:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-01"}

The gravitational waves generated during such\ninspirals encode information about the background in which the small object is\nmoving, providing a tracer of the spacetime geometry and a probe of\nstrong-field physics. In this paper, we construct approximate,\n\"analytic-kludge\" waveforms for such inspirals with parameterized\npost-Einsteinian corrections that allow for generic, model-independent\ndeformations of the supermassive black hole background away from the Kerr\nmetric. These approximate waveforms include all of the qualitative features of\ntrue waveforms for generic inspirals, including orbital eccentricity and\nrelativistic precession. The deformations of the Kerr metric are modeled using\na recently proposed, modified gravity bumpy metric, which parametrically\ndeforms the Kerr spacetime while ensuring that three approximate constants of\nthe motion remain for geodesic orbits: a conserved energy, azimuthal angular\nmomentum and Carter constant. The deformations represent modified gravity\neffects and have been analytically mapped to several modified gravity black\nhole solutions in four dimensions. In the analytic kludge waveforms, the\nconservative motion is modeled by a post-Newtonian expansion of the geodesic\nequations in the deformed spacetimes, which in turn induce modifications to the\nradiation-reaction force. These analytic-kludge waveforms serve as a first step\ntoward complete and model-independent tests of General Relativity with extreme\nmass-ratio inspirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 17:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 15:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-15"}

In this most general case, the diversity-multiplexing\ntradeoff is characterized as a solution to a simple, two-variable optimization\nproblem. This problem is then solved in closed form for special classes of\nchannels defined by certain restrictions on the numbers of antennas at the\nthree nodes. The key mathematical tool developed here that enables the explicit\ncharacterization of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is the joint eigenvalue\ndistribution of three mutually correlated random Wishart matrices. Previously,\nwithout actually characterizing the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, the\noptimality in this tradeoff metric of the dynamic compress-and-forward (DCF)\nprotocol based on the classical compress-and-forward scheme of Cover and El\nGamal was shown by Yuksel and Erkip.

Moreover, in special classes of the MIMO\nhalf-duplex relay channel, the optimal tradeoff is shown to be attainable even\nwithout this knowledge.

We present an\nindependent analytical verification of formulae for the cross section given by\nD.\\,Yu. Ivanov et al [Eur.\\ Phys.\\ J. C \\textbf{36}, 127 (2004)]. By choosing\nthe exact electron's helicity as the spin quantum number we show that the\nself-polarization effect exists only for the moderately relativistic electrons\nwith energy $\\gamma = E/mc^2 \\lesssim 10$ and only for a non-head-on collision\ngeometry. In these conditions polarization degree may achieve the values up to\n65%, but the effective polarization time is found to be larger than 1\\,s even\nfor a high power optical or infrared laser with intensity parameter $\\xi =\n|{\\bf E}| m c^2/E_c \\hbar \\omega \\sim 0.1$ ($E_c = m^2 c^3/e \\hbar$). This\nmakes such a polarization practically unrealizable. We also compare these\nresults with the ones of some papers where the high degree of polarization was\npredicted for ultrarelativistic case. We argue that this apparent contradiction\narises due to the different choice of the spin quantum numbers. In particular,\nthe quantum numbers which provide the high polarization degree represent\nneither helicity nor transverse polarization, that makes the use of them\ninconvenient in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 18:50:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 05:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 13:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 15:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-23"}

The most prominent computational\ntasks of infrastructures are the computation of the circumference of the\ninfrastructure and the generalized discrete logarithms. Both these problems are\nnot known to have efficient classical algorithms for an arbitrary\ninfrastructure. Our main contributions are polynomial time quantum algorithms\nfor one-dimensional infrastructures that satisfy certain conditions. For\ninstance, these conditions are always fulfilled for infrastructures obtained\nfrom number fields and function fields, both of unit rank one. Since quadratic\nnumber fields give rise to such infrastructures, this algorithm can be used to\nsolve Pell's equation and the principal ideal problem. In this sense we\ngeneralize Hallgren's quantum algorithms for quadratic number fields, while\nalso providing a polynomial speedup over them. Our more general approach shows\nthat these quantum algorithms can also be applied to infrastructures obtained\nfrom complex cubic and totally complex quartic number fields. Our improved way\nof analyzing the performance makes it possible to show that these algorithms\nsucceed with constant probability independent of the problem size. In contrast,\nthe lower bound on the success probability due to Hallgren decreases as the\nfourth power of the logarithm of the circumference. Our analysis also shows\nthat fewer qubits are required.

From two dimensional multi-component weak-lensing\nanalysis, we reveal that the cluster mass distribution is well described by\nthree main components, including a two component main cluster A2163-A with mass\nratio 1:8, and its cluster satellite A2163-B. The bimodal mass distribution in\nA2163-A is similar to the galaxy density distribution, but appears as spatially\nsegregated from the brightest X-ray emitting gas region.

Additionally, we use the results\nof an unconstrained simulation with a sixty times larger volume to calibrate\nthe influence of cosmic variance. We characterize the Mass Aggregation History\n(MAH) for each halo by three characteristic times, the formation, assembly and\nlast major merger times. A major merger is defined by a minimal mass ratio of\n10:1. We find that the three LGs share a similar MAH with formation and last\nmajor merger epochs placed on average \\approx 10 - 12 Gyr ago. Between 12% and\n17% of the halos in the mass range 5 x 10^11 Msol/h < M_h < 5 x 10^12 Msol/h\nhave a similar MAH. In a set of pairs of halos within the same mass range, a\nfraction of 1% to 3% share similar formation properties as both halos in the\nsimulated LG. An unsolved question posed by our results is the dynamical origin\nof the MAH of the LGs. The isolation criteria commonly used to define LG-like\nhalos in unconstrained simulations do not narrow down the halo population into\na set with quiet MAHs, nor does a further constraint to reside in a low density\nenvironment. The quiet MAH of the LGs provides a favorable environment for the\nformation of disk galaxies like the Milky Way and M31. The timing for the\nbeginning of the last major merger in the Milky Way dark matter halo matches\nwith the gas rich merger origin for the thick component in the galactic disk.\nOur results support the view that the specific large and mid scale environment\naround the Local Group play a critical role in shaping its MAH and hence its\nbaryonic structure at present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

As a result, it is harder to guarantee their\ncorrect behavior. One of the most successful methods for automated verification\nof finite-state systems is model checking. Most of the current model-checking\nsystems use binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for the representation of the\ntested model and in the verification process of its properties. Generally, BDDs\nallow a canonical compact representation of a boolean function (given an order\nof its variables). The more compact the BDD is, the better performance one gets\nfrom the verifier. However, finding an optimal order for a BDD is an\nNP-complete problem. Therefore, several heuristic methods based on expert\nknowledge have been developed for variable ordering. We propose an alternative\napproach in which the variable ordering algorithm gains 'ordering experience'\nfrom training models and uses the learned knowledge for finding good orders.\nOur methodology is based on offline learning of pair precedence classifiers\nfrom training models, that is, learning which variable pair permutation is more\nlikely to lead to a good order. For each training model, a number of training\nsequences are evaluated. Every training model variable pair permutation is then\ntagged based on its performance on the evaluated orders. The tagged\npermutations are then passed through a feature extractor and are given as\nexamples to a classifier creation algorithm. Given a model for which an order\nis requested, the ordering algorithm consults each precedence classifier and\nconstructs a pair precedence table which is used to create the order. Our\nalgorithm was integrated with SMV, which is one of the most widely used\nverification systems. Preliminary empirical evaluation of our methodology,\nusing real benchmark models, shows performance that is better than random\nordering and is competitive with existing algorithms that use expert knowledge.\nWe believe that in sub-domains of models (alu, caches, etc.) our system will\nprove even more valuable. This is because it features the ability to learn\nsub-domain knowledge, something that no other ordering algorithm does.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-04"}

Its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic\ndirected exploration algorithms from the set of on-line and off-line computed\nestimates and associated data structures. MIPS has shown distinguished\nperformance in the last two international planning competitions. In the last\nevent the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to\ninclude numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective\nfunctions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped\nschedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition,\nMIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track and every benchmark\ndomain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article\nintroduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were\nnecessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems\nand to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical\npath analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal\nparallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses\nknown NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect\nto the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of\nthis algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each\nencountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is\nscheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds\nand simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers\nknowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain\nobject symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been\ndeveloped to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with\nadmissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the\ncompetition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made,\nincluding floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration\naccording to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-04"}

Learners that instead seek to\nplay optimally with respect to the other players also depend upon equilibria\nsince equilibria are fixed points for learning. From another perspective,\nagents with limitations are real and common. These may be undesired physical\nlimitations as well as self-imposed rational limitations, such as abstraction\nand approximation techniques, used to make learning tractable. This article\nexplores the interactions of these two important concepts: equilibria and\nlimitations in learning. We introduce the question of whether equilibria\ncontinue to exist when agents have limitations. We look at the general effects\nlimitations can have on agent behavior, and define a natural extension of\nequilibria that accounts for these limitations. Using this formalization, we\nmake three major contributions: (i) a counterexample for the general existence\nof equilibria with limitations, (ii) sufficient conditions on limitations that\npreserve their existence, (iii) three general classes of games and limitations\nthat satisfy these conditions. We then present empirical results from a\nspecific multiagent learning algorithm applied to a specific instance of\nlimited agents. These results demonstrate that learning with limitations is\nfeasible, when the conditions outlined by our theoretical analysis hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-04"}

We focus on six prominent prediction algorithms, including Context\nTree Weighting (CTW), Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) and Probabilistic\nSuffix Trees (PSTs). We discuss the properties of these algorithms and compare\ntheir performance using real life sequences from three domains: proteins,\nEnglish text and music pieces. The comparison is made with respect to\nprediction quality as measured by the average log-loss. We also compare\nclassification algorithms based on these predictors with respect to a number of\nlarge protein classification tasks. Our results indicate that a \"decomposed\"\nCTW (a variant of the CTW algorithm) and PPM outperform all other algorithms in\nsequence prediction tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, a different algorithm, which\nis a modification of the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, significantly\noutperforms all algorithms on the protein classification problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-04"}

The intractability of these algorithms is to a\nlarge extent a consequence of computing an exact, optimal policy over the\nentire belief space. However, in real-world POMDP problems, computing the\noptimal policy for the full belief space is often unnecessary for good control\neven for problems with complicated policy classes. The beliefs experienced by\nthe controller often lie near a structured, low-dimensional subspace embedded\nin the high-dimensional belief space. Finding a good approximation to the\noptimal value function for only this subspace can be much easier than computing\nthe full value function. We introduce a new method for solving large-scale\nPOMDPs by reducing the dimensionality of the belief space. We use Exponential\nfamily Principal Components Analysis (Collins, Dasgupta and Schapire, 2002) to\nrepresent sparse, high-dimensional belief spaces using small sets of learned\nfeatures of the belief state. We then plan only in terms of the low-dimensional\nbelief features. By planning in this low-dimensional space, we can find\npolicies for POMDP models that are orders of magnitude larger than models that\ncan be handled by conventional techniques. We demonstrate the use of this\nalgorithm on a synthetic problem and on mobile robot navigation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:44:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 15:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-05"}

From the application of this model we find that the observed spectrum\nis consistent with a Compton-thick torus of material (column density\nNH=3.6(+1.3/-0.8) x 10^24 cm^-2) lying outside of the line of sight to the\nnucleus, leaving it bare of X-ray absorption in excess of the Galactic column.\nWe calculate that this material is sufficient to produce all of the Fe line\nflux without the need for any flux contribution from additional Compton-thin\ncircumnuclear material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 21:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

He seeks safety thresholds based upon requiring that cell phone\nenergy density be less than kBT. This proposal and related ideas produce\nthresholds many orders of magnitude below present values.\n  While Dr. Bruno is correct that cell phone microwave radiation is generally\nin the classical regime, he uses peculiar estimates (number of photons per\ncubic wavelength) that overstate the circumstance by more than 20 factors of\nten. He misunderstands the operation of optical tweezers and ignores their\nsignificant thermal effects. He credulously accepts poorly supported claims of\nnon-thermal effects. He mistakenly believes that kBT is the average thermal\nenergy (per cubic wavelength or per cell) in materials. It is not. It is twice\nthe average energy per molecule per degree of freedom in the material.

However, high rate performance\nfor LiMnPO4-based cathode materials has been challenging due to its extremely\nlow electrical and ionic conductivities. Here, we develop a synthesis of\nFe-doped LiMnPO4 (LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4) nanorods directly bonded on graphene\nsheets (reduced from graphene oxide) to render LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4 nanorods\nsuperior electrical conductivity. The LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4 nanorod morphology is\nunique to materials grown on graphene over those grown in free solution, and is\nideal for fast Li+ diffusion with the diffusion path of [010] crystallographic\naxis along the short radial direction (~20-30nm) of the nanorods. These\ntogether lead to ultrafast discharge within ~30-40 seconds without using a high\ncarbon content. With high columbic efficiency above 99.5% at a high operating\nvoltage, our LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4 nanorods/graphene hybrid exhibits the best rate\nperformance among all doped LiMnPO4 cathode materials for Lithium ion\nbatteries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 06:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-04"}

Many of these\napplications are actively being researched upon. Almost all these applications\nneed bipartite graphs of the order of tens of thousands in practice, whose\nnodes represent parallel computations. To reduce its implementation cost,\nreducing amount of system/hardware resources during design is an important\nengineering objective. In this context, we present a scheme to reduce resource\nutilization when performing computations derived from PG-based graphs. In a\nfully parallel design based on PG concepts, the number of processing units is\nequal to the number of vertices, each performing an atomic computation. To\nreduce the number of processing units used for implementation, we present an\neasy way of partitioning the vertex set. Each block of partition is then\nassigned to a processing unit. A processing unit performs the computations\ncorresponding to the vertices in the block assigned to it in a sequential\nfashion, thus creating the effect of folding the overall computation. These\nblocks have certain symmetric properties that enable us to develop a\nconflict-free schedule. The scheme achieves the best possible throughput, in\nlack of any overhead of shuffling data across memories while scheduling another\ncomputation on the same processing unit. This paper reports two folding\nschemes, which are based on same lattice embedding approach, based on\npartitioning. We first provide a scheme for a projective space of dimension\nfive, and the corresponding schedules. Both the folding schemes that we present\nhave been verified by both simulation and hardware prototyping for different\napplications. We later generalize this scheme to arbitrary projective spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 06:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

Analysis of time series represents and important tool in\nmany application areas, such as stock market analysis, process and quality\ncontrol, observation of natural phenomena, medical treatments, etc. A vital\ncomponent in many types of time-series analysis is the choice of an appropriate\ndistance/similarity measure. Numerous measures have been proposed to date, with\nthe most successful ones based on dynamic programming. Being of quadratic time\ncomplexity, however, global constraints are often employed to limit the search\nspace in the matrix during the dynamic programming procedure, in order to speed\nup computation. Furthermore, it has been reported that such constrained\nmeasures can also achieve better accuracy. In this paper, we investigate two\nrepresentative time-series distance/similarity measures based on dynamic\nprogramming, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS),\nand the effects of global constraints on them. Through extensive experiments on\na large number of time-series data sets, we demonstrate how global constrains\ncan significantly reduce the computation time of DTW and LCS. We also show\nthat, if the constraint parameter is tight enough (less than 10-15% of\ntime-series length), the constrained measure becomes significantly different\nfrom its unconstrained counterpart, in the sense of producing qualitatively\ndifferent 1-nearest neighbor graphs. This observation explains the potential\nfor accuracy gains when using constrained measures, highlighting the need for\ncareful tuning of constraint parameters in order to achieve a good trade-off\nbetween speed and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 08:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2013 11:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

An action density\noperator is correlated with three Polyakov loops representing the baryonic\nstate at a temperatures near the end of the QCD plateau, T/T_c = 0.8, and\nanother just before the deconfinement point, T/T_c = 0.9. The flux\ndistributions at short distance separations between the quarks display an\naction-density profile consistent with a filled Delta shape iso-surface.\nHowever the Delta-shaped action iso-surface distributions are found to persist\neven at large inter-quark separations for both temperatures. The action density\ndistribution in the quark plane exhibits a nonuniform pattern for all quark\nseparations considered. This result contrasts the well-known Y-shaped uniform\naction density gluonic-flux profile obtained using the Wilson-loop as a quark\nsource operator at zero temperature. We systematically measure and compare the\nmain aspects of the profile of the flux distribution at the two considered\ntemperature scales for three sets of isosceles triangle quark configurations.\nThe radii, amplitudes and rate of change of the width of the flux distribution\nare found to reverse their behavior as the temperature increase from the end of\nthe QCD plateau region towards the deconfinement point. Remarkably, we find the\nmean square width of the flux distribution shrinks and localizes for quark\nseparations larger than 1.0 fm at T/T_c = 0.8 which results in an identifiable\nY-shaped radius profile. Near the deconfinement point, the action-density\ndelocalizes and the width broadens linearly at large quark separations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 08:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The main difference\nwith a spiral potential is that more massive GMCs are able to accumulate in the\nspiral arms. Thus we are able to reproduce massive GMCs, and the spurs seen in\nmany grand design galaxies, even with stellar feedback. The presence of the\nspiral potential does not have an explicit effect on the star formation rate,\nbut can increase the star formation rate indirectly by enabling the formation\nof long-lived, strongly bound clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 09:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The\nsolving methodology proceeds in two steps : firstly a generic transfer strategy\nwith impulsive maneuvers is defined so that the problem becomes of finite\ndimension, secondly the problem is linearized around an initial reference\nsolution. A Branch and Bound algorithm is then applied to optimize\nsimultaneously the debris selection and the orbital maneuvers, yielding a new\nreference solution.

Furthermore, compared to 13 type I AGNs for which\nthe best Fe Ka line FWHM constraints were obtained, we found no difference in\nthe FWHM distribution or the mean FWHM, and this conclusion is independent of\nthe central black hole mass.

We\naim to determine the spatial distribution of ISM features in the central\n426x426 pc^2 of NGC4945. We map the central region of NGC4945 in three\nSpitzer-IRS modules (SH, SL and LL). We produce maps of the flux distribution\nof the starburst tracers [Ne II], [Ne III], [S III] and [S IV] at 12.81, 15.56,\n18.71 and 10.51 mum, respectively, and a map of the AGN narrow-line region\ntracer [Ne V] at 14.32 mum. We also mapped the S(1), S(2) and S(3) pure\nrotational lines of H2, which trace the distribution of warm molecular\nhydrogen. We obtained an extinction map (A_V) based on the apparent strength of\nthe 9.7 mum silicate absorption feature.

Within the uncertainty of the astrometry all emission lines are found\nto peak on the nucleus, except for the warm molecular hydrogen emission which\nshows a maximum 60-100 pc NW of the nucleus. We favour a scenario in which the\nlower H2 0-0 S(1) and S(2) rotational lines originate mainly from an unobscured\nextra-nuclear component associated with the super-wind cone observed in the HST\nNICMOS map of the H2 1-0 S(1) vibrational line.

Here we explore this concept for\none-dimensional repulsive nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations, which describe\nweakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or light propagation in a\nnonlinear medium. It is shown that the dynamics of phase-space translations of\nthe ground state of a harmonic potential is quite simple: the centre follows a\nclassical trajectory whereas its shape does not vary in time. The parabolic\npotential is the only one that satisfies this property. We study the time\nevolution of these nonlinear coherent states under perturbations of their\nshape, or of the confining potential. A rich variety of effects emerges. In\nparticular, in the presence of anharmonicities, we observe that the packet\nsplits into two distinct components. A fraction of the condensate is\ntransferred towards uncoherent high-energy modes, while the amplitude of\noscillation of the remaining coherent component is damped towards the bottom of\nthe well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 15:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 17:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

This study is part of a large project to study the physics of\naccretion and molecular outflows towards a selected sample of high-mass\nstar-forming regions that show evidence of infall and rotation from previous\nstudies. Aims. We wish to make a thorough study at high-angular resolution of\nthe structure and kinematics of the HMCs and corresponding molecular outflows\nin the high-mass star-forming region G24.78+0.08. Methods. We carried out SMA\nand IRAM PdBI observations at 1.3 and 1.4 mm, respectively, of dust and of\ntypical high-density and molecular outflow tracers with resolutions of <1\".\nComplementary IRAM 30-m 12CO and 13CO observations were carried out to recover\nthe short spacing information of the molecular outflows. Results. The\nmillimeter continuum emission towards cores G24 A1 and A2 has been resolved\ninto 3 and 2 cores, respectively, and named A1, A1b, A1c, A2, and A2b. All\nthese cores are aligned in a southeast-northwest direction coincident with that\nof the molecular outflows detected in the region, which suggests a preferential\ndirection for star formation in this region. The masses of the cores range from\n7 to 22 Msun, and the rotational temperatures from 128 to 180 K. The\nhigh-density tracers have revealed the existence of 2 velocity components\ntowards A1, one of them peaks close to the position of the millimeter continuum\npeak and of the HC HII region, and is associated with the velocity gradient\nseen in CH3CN towards this core, while the other one peaks southwest of core A1\nand is not associated with any millimeter continuum emission peak. The\nposition-velocity plots along outflow A and the 13CO averaged blueshifted and\nredshifted emission indicate that this outflow is driven by core A2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 09:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

As other\napproaches do, we start from low-level features extracted with image analysis\nto detect and characterize regions in an image. However, in contrast with\nfeature-based approaches, we provide a syntax to describe segmented regions as\nbasic objects and complex objects as compositions of basic ones. Then we\nintroduce a companion extensional semantics for defining reasoning services,\nsuch as retrieval, classification, and subsumption. These services can be used\nfor both exact and approximate matching, using similarity measures. Using our\nlogical approach as a formal specification, we implemented a complete\nclient-server image retrieval system, which allows a user to pose both queries\nby sketch and queries by example. A set of experiments has been carried out on\na testbed of images to assess the retrieval capabilities of the system in\ncomparison with expert users ranking. Results are presented adopting a\nwell-established measure of quality borrowed from textual information\nretrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 17:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-08"}
