Common domain walls are of\nBloch and Neel types in which the magnetization rotates around a fixed axis,\ngiving rise to a one-dimensional magnetization profile. Domain walls in helical\nmagnets, most relevant in multiferroics, were never studied systematically.\nHere we show that domain walls in helical magnets are fundamentally different\nfrom Bloch and Neel walls. They are generically characterized by a\ntwo-dimensional pattern formed by a regular lattice of vortex singularities. In\nconical phases vortices carry Berry phase flux giving rise to the anomalous\nHall effect. In multiferroics vortices are charged, allowing to manipulate\nmagnetic domain walls by electric fields. Our theory allows the interpretation\nof magnetic textures observed in helical magnetic structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 16:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 14:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-09"}

Zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature were then\nconsidered by Fisher, when the magnetic field is set to zero. Limiting\ndistributions of Lee-Yang and of Fisher zeros are physically important as they\ncontrol phase transitions in the model. One can also consider the zeros of the\npartition function simultaneously in both complex magnetic field and complex\ntemperature. They form an algebraic curve called the Lee-Yang-Fisher (LYF)\nzeros. In this paper we continue studying their limiting distribution for the\nDiamond Hierarchical Lattice (DHL). In this case, it can be described in terms\nof the dynamics of an explicit rational function R in two variables (the\nMigdal-Kadanoff renormalization transformation). We study properties of the\nFatou and Julia sets of this transformation and then we prove that the\nLee-Yang-Fisher zeros are equidistributed with respect to a dynamical\n(1,1)-current in the projective space. The free energy of the lattice gets\ninterpreted as the pluripotential of this current.

We probe\nregimes of forced steady-state isothermal flows and of unforced decaying ideal\ngas flows. The key quantity we measure is pressure dilatation cospectrum,\n$E^{PD}(k)$, where we provide the first numerical evidence that it decays at a\nrate faster than $k^{-1}$ as a function of wavenumber. This is sufficient to\nimply that mean pressure dilatation acts primarily at large-scales and that\nkinetic and internal energy budgets statistically decouple beyond a\ntransitional scale-range. Our results suggest that an extension of Kolmogorov's\ninertial-range theory to compressible turbulence is possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 17:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 19:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We seek a solution to this local\nproblem, the idea being that such a solution, if adopted by every node, could\nprovide a reasonable heuristic for the end-to-end forwarding problem. Towards\nthis end, we propose a relay selection problem comprising a forwarding node and\na collection of relay nodes, with the relays waking up sequentially at random\ntimes.

The forwarder's objective is to select a relay so as\nto minimize a combination of waiting-delay, reward and probing cost. Our\nproblem can be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem studied in\nthe operations research literature.

Though being ill-posed in nature, the above problem can be\nsolved in a unique and stable manner, provided proper regularization and\nrelevant boundary conditions. In this paper, however, a more challenging setup\nis addressed, in which one has to recover an image of interest from its noisy\nand blurry version, while the only information available about the imaging\nsystem at hand is the amplitude of the generalized pupil function (GPF) along\nwith partial observations of the gradient of GPF's phase. In this case, the\nphase-related information is collected using a simplified version of the\nShack-Hartmann interferometer, followed by recovering the entire phase by means\nof derivative compressed sensing. Subsequently, the estimated phase can be\ncombined with the amplitude of the GPF to produce an estimate of the point\nspread function (PSF), whose knowledge is essential for subsequent image\ndeconvolution. In summary, the principal contribution of this work is twofold.\nFirst, we demonstrate how to simplify the construction of the Shack-Hartmann\ninterferometer so as to make it less expensive and hence more accessible.\nSecond, it is shown by means of numerical experiments that the above\nsimplification and its associated solution scheme produce image reconstructions\nof the quality comparable to those obtained using dense sampling of the GPF\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 18:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

I derive an answer to\nthe question \"how likely must the shot be to go in before the player should\ntake it?\", and show that this \"lower cutoff\" for shot quality $f$ depends\ncrucially on the number $n$ of shot opportunities remaining (say, before the\nshot clock expires), with larger $n$ demanding that only higher-quality shots\nshould be taken. The function $f(n)$ is also derived in the presence of a\nfinite turnover rate and used to predict the shooting rate of an\noptimal-shooting team as a function of time. This prediction is compared to\nobserved shooting rates from the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the\ncomparison suggests that NBA players tend to wait too long before shooting and\nundervalue the probability of committing a turnover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 19:01:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2011 17:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-30"}

In this paper, we show that such universes can be reproduced\nby classical cosmology given that the universe is filled with an exotic matter.\nIn the case of a perfect fluid, we find an implicit equation of state (EoS). We\nthen show that this single fluid with an implict EoS is equivalent to two\nnon-interacting fluids, one of them representing stiff matter with negative\nenergy density.

In both cases we find that\nquantum mechanics changes completely the configuration of matter for small\nvalues of time, by adding a fluid or a scalar field with negative energy\ndensity. As time passes, the density of negative energy decreases and we\nrecover the ordinary content of the classical universe.

Abundances relative to solar are\nobtained for 25 elements with a mean error of 0.023 dex. The fact that 16CygA\nhas about four times more lithium than 16CygB is normal considering the\nslightly different masses of the stars. The abundance patterns of 16CygA and B,\nrelative to iron, are typical of that observed in most of the so-called solar\ntwin stars, with the exception of the heavy elements (Z>30), which can,\nhowever, be explained by Galactic chemical evolution. Differential (A-B)\nabundances are measured with even higher precision (0.018 dex, on average). We\nfind that 16CygA is more metal-rich than 16CygB by 0.041+/-0.007 dex. On an\nelement-to-element basis, no correlation between the A-B abundance differences\nand dust condensation temperature (Tc) is detected. Based on these results, we\nconclude that if the process of planet formation around 16CygB is responsible\nfor the observed abundance pattern, the formation of gas giants produces a\nconstant downwards shift in the photospheric abundance of metals, without a Tc\ncorrelation. The latter would be produced by the formation of terrestrial\nplanets instead, as suggested by other recent works on precise elemental\nabundances.

In addition,\nconcepts that are distinct in the conventional formalism become unified:\nchannels, sets of states, and positive operator valued measures are all seen to\nbe instances of conditional states; the action of a channel on a state,\nensemble averaging, the Born rule, the composition of channels, and\nnonselective state-update rules are all seen to be instances of belief\npropagation. Using a quantum generalization of Bayes' theorem and the\nassociated notion of Bayesian conditioning, we also show that the remote\nsteering of quantum states can be described within our formalism as a mere\nupdating of beliefs about one system given new information about another, and\nretrodictive inferences can be expressed using the same belief propagation rule\nas is used for predictive inferences. Finally, we show that previous arguments\nfor interpreting the projection postulate as a quantum generalization of\nBayesian conditioning are based on a misleading analogy and that it is best\nunderstood as a combination of belief propagation (corresponding to the\nnonselective state-update map) and conditioning on the measurement outcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 00:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 18:23:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 13:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 18:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

Recently, highly conductive\nsingle-molecule junctions (SMJ) with multiple transport channels have been\nformed from benzene molecules between Pt electrodes. Transport through these\nmulti-channel SMJs is a probe of both the bonding properties at the\nlead-molecule interface and of the molecular symmetry.\n  Here we utilize a many-body theory that properly describes the complementary\nnature of the charge carrier to calculate transport distributions through\nPt-benzene-Pt junctions.

In addition, we demonstrate that\nthe isolated resonance approximation is extremely accurate and determine that\ntransport occurs predominantly via the HOMO orbital in Pt-benzene-Pt junctions.\nFinally, we show that the transport occurs in a lead-molecule coupling regime\nwhere the charge carriers are both particle-like and wave-like simultaneously,\nrequiring a many-body description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 01:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-01"}

The\naverage matter density along the Tokai-to-Kamioka baseline is found to be 2.6\ng/cm^3, and that for the Tokai-to-Korea baseline is 2.85, 2.98, and 3.05 g/cm^3\nfor the baseline length of L = 1000, 1100, and 1200 km, respectively.

The effect of the matter density distribution along the\nbaseline is studied by using the step function approximation and the Fourier\nanalysis.

Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet. We also\nfind that unlike the usual Type III seesaw model where at least two copies of\nleptonic triplets are needed, with both doublet and quadruplet Higgs\nrepresentations, just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a\nphenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive\nsizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels.

Many classical decision problems\nare studied in formal language theory and in automata theory and arise now\nnaturally about recognizable languages of infinite pictures. We first review in\nthis paper some recent results of [Fin09b] where we gave the exact degree of\nnumerous undecidable problems for B\\\"uchi-recognizable languages of infinite\npictures, which are actually located at the first or at the second level of the\nanalytical hierarchy, and \"highly undecidable\".

We calculate the fraction of extended emission as a function of\nwavelength for all galaxies in the sample, FEE_lambda, and spatially separate\nthe MIR spectrum of galaxies into their nuclear and extended components.\n  We find that the [NeII] emission line is as compact as the hot dust MIR\ncontinuum, while the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is more\nextended. The 6.2 and 7.7 micron PAH emission is more compact than that of the\n11.3 micron PAH, which is consistent with the formers being enhanced in a more\nionized medium. The presence of an AGN or a powerful nuclear starburst\nincreases the compactness of the hot dust MIR continuum, but has a negligible\neffect on the spatial extent of the PAH emission on kpc-scales. Globally, the\nspectra of the extended emission component are homogeneous for all galaxies in\nGOALS. This suggests that the physical properties of star formation taking\nplace at distances farther than 1.5 kpc from the nuclei of (U)LIRGs are very\nsimilar, resembling local star-forming galaxies with L_IR < 10^11 Lsun, as well\nas star formation-dominated ULIRGs at z~2.

In the case where such models\ncan be efficiently simulated, Bayesian inference is still possible thanks to\nthe Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm. Although many refinements\nhave been suggested, ABC inference is still far from routine. ABC is often\nexcruciatingly slow due to very low acceptance rates. In addition, ABC requires\nintroducing a vector of \"summary statistics\", the choice of which is relatively\narbitrary, and often require some trial and error, making the whole process\nquite laborious for the user.\n  We introduce in this work the EP-ABC algorithm, which is an adaptation to the\nlikelihood-free context of the variational approximation algorithm known as\nExpectation Propagation (Minka, 2001). The main advantage of EP-ABC is that it\nis faster by a few orders of magnitude than standard algorithms, while\nproducing an overall approximation error which is typically negligible. A\nsecond advantage of EP-ABC is that it replaces the usual global ABC constraint\non the vector of summary statistics computed on the whole dataset, by n local\nconstraints of the form that apply separately to each data-point. As a\nconsequence, it is often possible to do away with summary statistics entirely.\nIn that case, EP-ABC approximates directly the evidence (marginal likelihood)\nof the model.\n  Comparisons are performed in three real-world applications which are typical\nof likelihood-free inference, including one application in neuroscience which\nis novel, and possibly too challenging for standard ABC techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 13:15:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 08:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-19"}

Although the bounding parameters are drawn by the current PTA or the\nupcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and by the New Gravitational Observatory\n(NGO), derived from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), this paper\nalso addresses sequential detection beyond specific project constraints. We\nconsider PTA-SKA, which is sensitive from 10^(-9) to p x 10^(-7) Hz (p=4, 8),\nand SLI, which operates from s x 10^(-5) up to 1 Hz (s = 1, 3). A SMBHB in the\nrange 2x 10^(8) - 2 x 10^(9) solar masses (the masses are normalised to a (1+z)\nfactor, the red shift lying between z = 0.2 and z=1.5) moves from the PTA-SKA\nto the SLI band over a period ranging from two months to fifty years. By\ncombining three Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH)-host relations with three\naccretion prescriptions, nine astrophysical scenarios are formed. They are then\nrelated to three levels of pulsar timing residuals (50, 5, 1 ns), generating\ntwenty-seven cases. For residuals of 1 ns, sequential detection probability\nwill never be better than 4.7 x 10^(-4) y^(-2) or 3.3 x 10^(-6) y^(-2) (per\nyear to merger and per year of survey), according to the best and worst\nastrophysical scenarios, respectively; put differently this means one\nsequential detection every 46 or 550 years for an equivalent maximum time to\nmerger and duration of the survey. The chances of sequential detection are\nfurther reduced by increasing values of the s parameter (they vanish for s =\n10) and of the SLI noise, and by decreasing values of the remnant spin.

Within the D=3 approach this classification\namounts to a classification of regular and singular extremal black hole\nsolutions of supergravity. We show that the pattern of such orbits is a\nuniversal property depending only on the Tits-Satake universality class of the\nconsidered model, the number of such classes being five. We present a new\nalgorithm for the classification and construction of the nilpotent orbits for\neach universality class which is based on an essential use of the Weyl group W\nof the Tits Satake subalgebra U_{TS} of U and on a certain subgroup W_H\nthereof. The splitting of orbits of the full group Uinto suborbits with respect\nto the stability subgroup H* is shown to be governed by the structure of the\ndiscrete coset W/W_H. For the case of the universality class SO(4,5) /[SO(2,3)\nx SO(2,2)] we derive the complete list of nilpotent orbits which happens to\ncontain 37 elements. We also show how the universal orbits are regularly\nembedded in all the members of the class that are infinite in number. As a\nmatter of check we apply our new algorithm also to the Tits Satake class\nG_(2,2)/[SL(2)x SL(2)] confirming the previously obtained result encompassing 7\nnilpotent orbits. Perspectives for future developments based on the obtained\nresults are outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 14:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-01"}
