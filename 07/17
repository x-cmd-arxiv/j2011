It is found that the intrinsic\nanomalous Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy}^H$) obtained from the GGA+U\ncalculations with $U = 1.9$ eV and $J=1.2$ eV, is in nearly perfect agreement\nwith that measured recently at low temperatures while, in contrast, the\n$\\sigma_{xy}^H$ from the GGA calculations is about 100% larger than the\nmeasured one. This indicates that, as for the other spin-orbit interaction\n(SOI)-induced phenomena in 3$d$ itinerant magnets such as the orbital magnetic\nmagnetization and magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the on-site electron-electron\ncorrelation, though moderate only, should be taken into account properly in\norder to get the correct anomalous Hall conductivity. The intrinsic\n$\\sigma_{xy}^H$ and the number of valence electrons ($N_e$) have also been\ncalculated as a function of the Fermi energy ($E_F$). A sign change is\npredicted at $E_F = -0.38$ eV ($N_e = 9.57$), and this explain qualitatively\nwhy the theoretical and experimental $\\sigma_{xy}^H$ values for Fe and Co are\npositive. It is also predicted that fcc Ni$_{(1-x)}$Co(Fe,Cu)$_x$ alloys with\n$x$ being small, would also have the negative $\\sigma_{xy}^H$ with the\nmagnitude being in the range of $500\\sim 1400$ $\\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. The most\npronounced effect of including the on-site Coulomb interaction is that all the\n$d$-dominant bands are lowered in energy relative to the $E_F$ by about 0.3 eV,\nand consequently, the small minority spin X$_2$ hole pocket disappears. The\npresence of the small X$_2$ hole pocket in the GGA calculations is attributed\nto be responsible for the large discrepancy in the $\\sigma_{xy}^H$ between\ntheory and experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2011 17:32:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 07:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Small molecules in the series Anthracene, Tetracene,\nPentacene, are model molecules for organic semiconductor thin films to be used\nas the active layers in such devices. This has motivated a number of studies of\npolyacene thin film growth and structure. Although the majority of these\nstudies rely on vapor-deposited films, solvent-based deposition of films with\nimproved properties onto non-crystalline substrates is desired for industrial\nproduction of devices. Improved ordering in thin films will have a large impact\non their electronic properties, since grain boundaries and other defects are\ndetrimental to carrier mobilities and lifetimes. Thus, a long-standing\nchallenge in this field is to prepare largearea single crystal films on\narbitrary substrates. Here we demonstrate a solvent-based method to deposit\nthin films of organic semiconductors, which is very general. Anthracene thin\nfilms with single-crystal domain sizes exceeding 1x1 cm2 can be prepared on\nvarious substrates by the technique. Films of\n6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene are also demonstrated to have grain\nsizes larger than 2x2 mm2. In contrast, films produced by conventional means\nsuch as vapor deposition or spin coating are polycrystalline with micron-scale\ngrain sizes. The general propensity of these small molecules towards\ncrystalline order in an optimized solvent deposition process shows that there\nis great potential for thin films with improved properties.

To annotate protein functions as sets of interaction\nstates at atomic resolution, and thereby to better understand the relation\nbetween protein interactions and biological functions, we conducted exhaustive\nall-against-all atomic structure comparisons of all known binding sites for\nligands including small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids, and identified\nrecurring elementary motifs. By integrating the elementary motifs associated\nwith each subunit, we defined composite motifs which represent\ncontext-dependent combinations of elementary motifs. It is demonstrated that\nfunction similarity can be better inferred from composite motif similarity\ncompared to the similarity of protein sequences or of individual binding sites.\nBy integrating the composite motifs associated with each protein function, we\ndefine meta-composite motifs each of which is regarded as a time-independent\ndiagrammatic representation of a biological process. It is shown that\nmeta-composite motifs provide richer annotations of biological processes than\nsequence clusters. The present results serve as a basis for bridging atomic\nstructures to higher-order biological phenomena by classification and\nintegration of binding site structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2011 05:56:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 02:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-13"}

We aim to\ninvestigate how they affect the evolution of galactic magnetic fields. We\nselected 16 systems of interacting galaxies and compared their radio emission\nand estimated magnetic field strengths with their star-forming activity,\nfar-infrared emission, and the stage of tidal interaction. We find a general\nevolution of magnetic fields: for weak interactions the strength of magnetic\nfield is almost constant (10-15muG) as interaction advances, then it increases\nup to 2x, peaks at the nuclear coalescence (25muG), and decreases again, down\nto 5-6muG, for the post-merger remnants. The magnetic field strength for whole\ngalaxies is weakly affected by the star formation rate (SFR), while the\ndependence is higher for galactic centres. We show that the morphological\ndistortions visible in the radio total and polarized emission do not depend\nstatistically on the global or local SFRs, while they do increase with the\nadvance of interaction. The constructed radio-far-infrared relations for\ninteracting and non-interacting galaxies display a similar balance between the\ngeneration of cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and the production of the thermal\nenergy and dust radiation. The process of strong gravitational interactions can\nefficiently magnetize the merger's surroundings, having a similar magnetizing\neffect on intergalactic medium as supernova explosions or galactic winds. If\ninteracting galaxies generate some ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), the\ndisk or magnetized outflows can deflect them (up to 23 degrees), and make an\nassociation of the observed UHECRs with the sites of their origin very\nuncertain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2011 06:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 17:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-23"}
