A\nsystematic study of aerosols and their impact on public health, especially in\nhighly-populated urban areas, requires a finer-resolution estimate of the\nspatial distribution of AOD values.\n  We embed MISR's operational weighted least squares criterion and its forward\nsimulations for AOD retrieval in a likelihood framework and further expand it\ninto a Bayesian hierarchical model to adapt to a finer spatial scale of 4.4 km\nx 4.4 km. To take advantage of AOD's spatial smoothness, our method borrows\nstrength from data at neighboring pixels by postulating a Gaussian Markov\nRandom Field prior for AOD.

While prompt and\ncontemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to test\npredictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaging\nhas been conducted for only a few GRBs. We present rich, early-time, multiband\ndatasets for two \\swift\\ events, GRB 110205A and GRB 110213A. The former shows\noptical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by the\nsteep rising in flux up to ~1000s after the burst ($t^{-\\alpha}$ with\n$\\alpha=-6.13 \\pm 0.75$). We discuss this feature in the context of the\nreverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay as\nbeing forward-shock dominated. Polarization measurements, obtained with the\nRINGO2 instrument mounted on the Liverpool Telescope, also provide hints on the\nnature of the emitting ejecta. The latter event, instead, displays a very\npeculiar optical to near-infrared lightcurve, with two achromatic peaks. In\nthis case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow,\nwe interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material,\nsignifying a late-time activity of the central engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 04:03:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 00:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In\nGPU computing, divergence of execution paths between threads can considerably\nreduce the efficiency. Since photons and electrons undergo different physics\nand hence attain different execution paths, we use a simulation scheme where\nphoton transport and electron transport are separated to partially relieve the\nthread divergence issue.

Of particular interest is a concentration of thin and long elephant\ntrunk-like structures in the southeastern part of IC 1848E. Some of them have\nan apparently associated star (or two stars) at their very tip. We conducted\n$VI_{c}$ photometry of several of these stars. Their positions on the\n$V/(V-I_{c})$ color-magnitude diagram as well as the physical parameters\nobtained by SED fittings indicate that they are low-mass pre-main-sequence\nstars having ages of mostly one Myr or less. This strongly suggests that they\nformed from elongated, elephant trunk-like clouds. We presume that such\nelephant trunk-like structures are genetically different from BRCs, on the\nbasis of the differences in morphology, size distributions, and the ages of the\nassociated young stars. We suspect that those clouds have been caused by\nhydrodynamical instability of the ionization/shock front of the expanding HII\nregion. Similar structures often show up in recent numerical simulations of the\nevolution of HII regions. We further hypothesize that this mechanism makes a\nthird mode of triggered star formation associated with HII regions, in addition\nto the two known mechanisms, i.e., collect-and-collapse of the shell\naccumulated around an expanding HII region and radiation-driven implosion of\nBRCs originated from pre-existing cloud clumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 05:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Shallow-water magnetohydrodynamic equations were used to study the\ndynamics of large-scale waves at the rapidly rotating stellar tachoclines in\nthe presence of toroidal magnetic field.

Using binding neuron (BN) as a model, we\nderive analytically the exact expressions for the output interspike intervals\n(ISI) probability density, mean output ISI and coefficient of variation as\nfunctions of model's parameters for the case of threshold 2. Using the leaky\nintegrate-and-fire (LIF) model, as well as the BN model with higher thresholds,\nthese statistical quantities are found numerically. In contrast to the\npreviously studied situation of no feedback, the ISI probability densities\nfound here both for BN and LIF neuron become bimodal and have discontinuity of\njump type. Nevertheless, the presence of inhibitory delayed feedback was not\nfound to affect substantially the output ISI coefficient of variation.

We interpret disagreeing\nprevious predictions between linearized theory and simulations: in the linear\nlimit, the kinetic energy of transverse velocity components, normal to the\nmagnetic field, decays faster than the kinetic energy of the axial component,\nalong the magnetic field (Moffatt (1967)); whereas many numerical studies\npredict a final state characterised by dominant energy of transverse velocity\ncomponents. We investigate the corresponding nonlinear phenomenon using Direct\nNumerical Simulations of freely-decaying turbulence, and a two-point\nstatistical spectral closure based on the Eddy Damped Quasi-Normal Markovian\nmodel. The transition from the three-dimensional turbulent flow to a\n\"two-and-a-half-dimensional\" flow (Montgomery & Turner (1982)) is a result of\nthe combined effects of short-time linear Joule dissipation and longer time\nnonlinear creation of polarisation anisotropy. It is this combination of linear\nand nonlinear effects which explains the disagreement between predictions from\nlinearized theory and results from numerical simulations. The transition is\ncharacterized by the elongation of turbulent structures along the applied\nmagnetic field, and by the strong anisotropy of directional two-point\ncorrelation spectra, in agreement with experimental evidence. Inertial\nequatorial transfers in both DNS and the model are presented to describe in\ndetail the most important equilibrium dynamics.

This review focuses on quantitative\naspects of L-type currents. L-type channels are now distinguished according to\ntheir structure as one of four main subtypes 1.1-1.4. L-type calcium currents\nplay many fundamental roles in cellular dynamical processes including\npacemaking in neurons and cardiac cells, the activation of transcription\nfactors involved in synaptic plasticity and in immune cells. The\nhalf-activation potentials of L-type currents have been ascribed values as low\nas -50 mV and as high as near 0 mV. The inactivation of I_L has been found to\nbe both voltage (VDI) and calcium-dependent (CDI) and the latter component may\ninvolve calcium-induced calcium release. CDI is often an important aspect of\ndynamical models of cell electrophysiology. We describe the basic components in\nmodeling I_L including activation and both voltage and calcium dependent\ninactivation and the two main approaches to determining the current. We review,\nby means of tables of values from over 65 representative studies, the various\ndetails of the dynamical properties associated with I_L that have been found\nexperimentally or employed in the last 25 years in deterministic modeling in\nvarious nervous system and cardiac cells.

We aim to derive carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine abundances for\nthe first time from the infrared spectra of the barium red giant star HD 123396\nto quantitatively test AGB nucleosynthesis models for producing barium stars\nvia mass accretion. High-resolution and high S/N infrared spectra were obtained\nusing the Phoenix spectrograph mounted at the Gemini South telescope. The\nabundances were obtained through spectrum synthesis of individual atomic and\nmolecular lines, using the MOOG stellar line analysis program, together with\nKurucz's stellar atmosphere models. The analysis was classical, using 1D\nstellar models and spectral synthesis under the assumption of local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. We confirm that HD 123396 is a metal-deficient\nbarium star ([Fe/H] = -1.05), with A(C) = 7.88, A(N) = 6.65, A(O) = 7.93, and\nA(Na) = 5.28 on a logarithmic scale where A(H) = 12, leading to [(C+N)/Fe] ~\n0.5. The A(CNO) group, as well as the A(Na) abundances, is in excellent\nagreement with those previously derived for this star using high resolution\noptical data. We also found A(F) = 4.16, which implies [F/O] = 0.39, a value\nthat is substantially higher than the F abundances measured in globular\nclusters of a similar metallicity, noting that there are no F measurements in\nfield stars of comparable metallicity. The observed abundance pattern of the\nlight elements (CNO, F and Na) recovered here as well as the heavy elements\n(s-process) studied elsewhere suggest that the surface composition of HD 123396\nis well fitted by the predicted abundance pattern of a 1.5Msun AGB model star\nwith Z = 0.001.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 15:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 03:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 20:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Circumstellar dust is\nsubject to radial drift, vertical settling, turbulent mixing, collisional\ngrowth, fragmentation and erosion.\n  We approach this subject from three directions: analytical calculations,\nnumerical simulations, and comparison to observations. We describe the physical\nand numerical concepts that go into a model which is able to simulate the\nradial and size evolution of dust in a gas disk which is viscously evolving\nover several million years. The resulting dust size distributions are compared\nto our analytical predictions and a simple recipe for obtaining steady-state\ndust size distributions is derived.

This manuscript examines the difference in\ntreatment of spin-orbit interaction under the single and double group\nformulations. We show that the restriction to the adapted double group bases,\nbrought about by the imposition of single group selection rule in calculating\nthe k.p interaction, is not appropriate. In addition, the unitary\ntransformation employed in the literature to diagonalise the intra-band spin\norbit interaction in semiconductors with diamond lattice can not remove the\ninter-band terms. It leads to a bases set for valence band ordered differently\nfrom D_3/2^+ in the O(3) group thus invalidating any correlation of magnetic\nquantum number to the z component of angular momentum. Under the double group\nconsideration, spin-orbit interaction affects all the zone centre states and\noffers a mechanism for changing the relative positions of various zone centre\nstates in the conduction band. In addition to the mixing caused by k\nindependent spin orbit terms, formation of hybridised orbitals under double\ngroup rules also produce mixing. This can lead to inversion in materials such\nas \\alpha-tin. The re-arrangement of conduction band zone centre states leads\nto a negative \\gamma_2 in most materials with respect to the valence band bases\nhaving the same order as D_3/2^+ in the O(3) group. The double group\nformulation is also required in the description of Zeeman interaction,\nincluding the S.B term, for the mixed zone centre states.

In addition, this method accurately describes the dynamics of\nlow energy particles starting from a solenoid immersed cathode, allowing the\nmethod to be used to simulate transport through both RF and electrostatic guns.\nComparison of particle tracking with the transfer matrix and direct integration\nof the equations of motion through several field set-ups shows excellent\nagreement between the two methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 15:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 15:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

The excitations are expressed in\nterms of the wake field of a charged particle moving in plasma. The result\nexplicitly addresses the efficiency of the photon-to-plasmon conversion and the\ntype of excitation. While strong absorption of the radiation by the excitations\nis reached at larger plasmon wave numbers, intense persistent plasma waves are\ncreated at optimal ones. The latter wave numbers depend on the spectrum of\nplasmons and the distance that the waves are required to travel without being\nsubstantially attenuated. Their type, which can be traveling or standing, is\ngoverned by the geometry of the defects and the polarization of the radiation.\nWe identify such types of traveling plasmons as circular plasmons, excited at\ndot defects, and traverse plasmons, excited at straight wire defects and\ntraveling away from (toward) the wires if their group velocity is positive\n(negative). Nonlinear excitations are also accounted for. In particular, we\nanalyze the zeroth harmonic, linear in the microwave intensity, which has the\ncharacter of a frozen charge density wave. The interference of elementary wakes\nfrom defects arranged in truncated periodic sets can produce amplified\nplasmons, which are easily portrayed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 15:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

The Niemeier lattice serves to express all these symplectic\nautomorphisms as elements of the Mathieu group M_24, generating the\n'overarching finite symmetry group' (Z_2)^4:A_7 of Kummer surfaces. This group\nhas order 40320, thus surpassing the size of the largest finite symplectic\nautomorphism group of a K3 surface by orders of magnitude. For every Kummer\nsurface this group contains the group of symplectic automorphisms leaving the\nKaehler class invariant which is induced from the underlying torus. Our results\nare in line with the existence proofs of Mukai and Kondo, that finite groups of\nsymplectic automorphisms of K3 are subgroups of one of eleven subgroups of\nM_23, and we extend their techniques of lattice embeddings for all Kummer\nsurfaces with Kaehler class induced from the underlying torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 15:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 13:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 14:33:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 12:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2013 18:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-20"}
