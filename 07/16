In the present paper, we focus on\nproving regularity theorems for stationary and minimizing harmonic maps and\nminimal currents. There are several aspects to our improvements of known\nestimates. First, we replace known estimates on the Hausdorff dimension of\nsingular sets by estimates on their Minkowski r-content, or equivalently, on\nthe volumes of their r-tubular neighborhoods. Second, we give improved\nregularity control with respect to the number of derivatives bounded and/or on\nthe norm in which the derivatives are bounded. As an example of the former, our\nresults for minimizing harmonic maps f : M->N between riemannian manifolds\ninclude a priori bounds in W^{1,p}\\cap W^{2,p} for all p < 3. These are the\nfirst such bounds involving second derivatives in general dimensions. Finally,\nthe quantity we control is actually provides much stronger information than\nfollows from a bound on the L^p norm of derivatives. Namely, we obtain L^p\nbounds for the inverse of the regularity scale\nr_f(x)=max{r:sup_{B_r(x)}(r|\\nabla f|+r^2|\\nabla^2 f|)\\leq 1}. Applications to\nminimal hypersufaces include a priori L^p bounds for the second fundamental\nform A for all p < 7. Previously known bounds were for p < 2+\\epsilon(n).\nAgain, the full theorem is much stronger and yields Lp bounds for the\ncorresponding regularity scale r_A(x)=max{r:sup_{B_r(x)}rA\\leq 1}. In outline,\nour discussion follows that of an earlier paper in which we proved analogous\nestimates in the context of noncollapsed riemannian manifolds with a lower\nbound on Ricci curvature. These were applied to Einstein manifolds. A key point\nin all of these arguments is to establish the relevant quantitative\ndifferentiation theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 16:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 20:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-31"}

It is based on the Armijo step\nsize along certain Gateaux derivatives of the performance functional, thereby\navoiding some of the computational difficulties associated with discrete\nscheduling parameters. Its convergence to local minima as well as its rate of\nconvergence are proved, and a simulation example on a nonlinear system exhibits\nquite a fast convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 16:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-18"}

The use of the UVJ diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescent\ngalaxies from star forming galaxies (SFGs) is becoming more common due to its\nability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened SFGs. Quiescent\ngalaxies occupy a small and distinct region of UVJ color space and we find most\nof them to have concentrated profiles with high Sersic indices (n>2.5) and\nsmooth structure characteristic of early-type systems.

The heavily obscured objects in our sample are of moderate intrinsic\nX-ray luminosity [ ~ (0.9-4)x10^{42} erg/s in the 2-10 keV band].

The z~0.5-1 CT objects\nstudied here are expected to contribute ~1% of the total XRB flux in the 10-30\nkeV band, and they account for ~5-15% of the emission in this energy band\nexpected from all CT AGNs according to population-synthesis models. In the 6--8\nkeV band, the stacked signal of the 23 heavily obscured candidates accounts for\n<5% of the unresolved XRB flux, while the unresolved ~25% of the XRB in this\nband can probably be explained by a stacking analysis of the X-ray undetected\noptical galaxies in the CDF-S (a 2.5 sigma stacked signal).

We have\nproposed a GUP consistent with string theory, black hole physics and doubly\nspecial relativity theories and have showed that this modifies all quantum\nmechanical Hamiltonians. When applied to an elementary particle, it suggests\nthat the space that confines it must be quantized, and in fact that all\nmeasurable lengths are quantized in units of a fundamental length (which can be\nthe Planck length). On the one hand, this may signal the breakdown of the\nspacetime continuum picture near that scale, and on the other hand, it can\npredict an upper bound on the quantum gravity parameter in the GUP, from\ncurrent observations. Furthermore, such fundamental discreteness of space may\nhave observable consequences at length scales much larger than the Planck\nscale. Because this influences all the quantum Hamiltonians in an universal\nway, it predicts quantum gravity corrections to various quantum phenomena.\nTherefore, in the present work we compute these corrections to the Lamb shift,\nsimple harmonic oscillator, Landau levels, and the tunneling current in a\nscanning tunneling microscope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 20:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 17:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-25"}

Typical\noptimal algorithms require solving an NP-hard sub-problem. To meet the\nchallenge, one stream of research focuses on finding simpler sub-optimal\nalgorithms that have low complexity but high efficiency in practice. In this\npaper, we study the performance guarantee of one such scheduling algorithm, the\nLongest-Queue-First (LQF) algorithm. It is known that the LQF algorithm\nachieves the full capacity region, $\\Lambda$, when the interference graph\nsatisfies the so-called local pooling condition. For a general graph $G$, LQF\nachieves (i.e., stabilizes) a part of the capacity region, $\\sigma^*(G)\n\\Lambda$, where $\\sigma^*(G)$ is the overall local pooling factor of the\ninterference graph $G$ and $\\sigma^*(G) \\leq 1$. It has been shown later that\nLQF achieves a larger rate region, $\\Sigma^*(G) \\Lambda$, where $\\Sigma^ (G)$\nis a diagonal matrix. The contribution of this paper is to describe three new\nachievable rate regions, which are larger than the previously-known regions. In\nparticular, the new regions include all the extreme points of the capacity\nregion and are not convex in general. We also discover a counter-intuitive\nphenomenon in which increasing the arrival rate may sometime help to stabilize\nthe network. This phenomenon can be well explained using the theory developed\nin the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2011 05:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

Inspection has proven to be one of the promising techniques\nof defect management.

This article\nelucidates a mathematical approach to estimate the IPM value without depending\non shop floor defect count at every time. By applying multiple linear\nregression models, a set of characteristic coefficients of the team is\nevaluated. These coefficients are calculated from the empirical projects that\nare sampled from the teams of product-based and service-based IT industries.

The IPM values observed\nonsite and IPM values produced by our model which are strongly matching,\nsupport the predictive capability of IPM through team coefficients.

Evaluation of team coefficients resolves several defect-associated\nissues, which are related to the management, stakeholders, outsourcing agents\nand customers.

Here, we perform\natomistic simulations on freestanding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to first\nidentify the minimal shapes, and then employ a core-edge framework based on\nclassical plate theory to quantify the width dependence in more general\nsystems. The elastic edge-edge interactions force ultra-narrow ribbons to be\nflat, which then bifurcate to twisted and bent shapes at critical widths that\nvary inversely with edge stress. Compressive edge stresses results in twisted\nand saddle shapes that are energetically indistinguishable in the vicinity of\nthe bifurcation. Increasing widths favor the saddle shapes with (longitudinal)\nribbon curvatures that vary non-linearly with width and edge stress. Positive\nedge stresses result in a flat-to-curled transition with similar scalings. At\nlarge widths with negligible edge-edge interactions, rippling instabilities set\nin, i.e. edge ripples and midline dimples for compressive and tensile edge\nstresses. Our results highlight the utility of the core-edge framework in\ndeveloping a unified understanding of the interplay between geometry and\nmechanics that sets the morphology of crystalline nanoribbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 21:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}
