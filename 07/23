This major accomplishment has been spurred by\nthe growing amounts of data on the highly obscured high-z Universe and the\nintriguing local properties of the Solar Neighbourhood (SoNE). We present here\na new model able to simulate the formation and evolution of dust in the ISM.\nThe model follows the evolution of 16 elemental species, with particular\nattention to those that are simultaneously present in form of gas and dust,\ne.g. C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Fe. In this study we focus on the SoNe and the\nMW Disk as a whole which are considered as laboratories to test the physical\ningredients governing the dust evolution. Infall of primordial gas, birth and\ndeath of stars, radial flows of matter between contiguous shells, presence of a\ncentral bar, star-dust emission by SNae and AGB stars, dust destruction and\naccretion are taken into account. The model reproduces the local depletion of\nthe elements in the gas, and simultaneously satisfies other constraints\nobtained from the observations. The evolution of the element abundances in the\ngas and dust has been well reproduced for plausible choices of the parameters.\nThe Mg/Si ratio, in particular, drives the formation of silicates. We show that\nfor most of the evolution of the MW, the main process for dust enrichment is\nthe accretion in the cold regions of the ISM. SNae dominate in the early phases\nof the evolution. We have examined the main factors controlling the temporal\nwindow in which SNae govern the dust budget both in low and high star forming\nenvironments. The role played by AGB stars is discussed. We find that IMFs with\nregular slope in the range of massive stars better reproduce the observed\ndepletions. The results obtained for the SoNe lead us to safely extend the\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 16:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-25"}

In a series of three papers we have\ntackled the problem and set a modern chemical evolution model. In the first\npaper (Piovan et al., 2011a) we revised the condensation coefficients for the\nelements that typically are present in the dust. In the second paper (Piovan et\nal., 2011b) we have implemented the dust into the Padova chemical model and\ntested it against the observational data for the Solar Neighbourhood. In this\npaper we extend it to the whole Disk of the Milky Way (MW). The Disk is used as\na laboratory to analyze the spatial and temporal behaviour of (i) several dust\ngrain families with the aid of which we can describe the ISM, (ii) the\nabundances in the gas, dust, and total ISM of the elements present in the dust\nand (iii) the depletion of the same elements. The temporal evolution of the\ndust and gas across the Disk is calculated under the effect of radial flows and\na central Bar. The gradients of the abundances of C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Fe\nin gas and dust across the Disk are derived as a function of time. The\ntheoretical gradients nicely reproduce those derived from Cepheids, OB stars,\nRed Giants and HII regions. This provides the backbone for the companion\nprocesses of dust formation and evolution across the Disk. We examine in detail\nthe contributions to dust by AGB stars, SNae and grain accretion in the ISM at\ndifferent galacto-centric distances. Furthermore, we examine the variation of\nthe ratio silicates/carbonaceous grains with time and position in the Disk.\nFinally, some hints about the depletion of the elements in regions of high and\nlow SFR (inner and outer Disk) are presented.

In AI research,\nalgorithms for analogy are often limited by the need for hand-coded high-level\nrepresentations as input. An alternative approach is to use high-level\nperception, in which high-level representations are automatically generated\nfrom raw data. Analogy perception is the process of recognizing analogies using\nhigh-level perception. We present PairClass, an algorithm for analogy\nperception that recognizes lexical proportional analogies using representations\nthat are automatically generated from a large corpus of raw textual data. A\nproportional analogy is an analogy of the form A:B::C:D, meaning \"A is to B as\nC is to D\". A lexical proportional analogy is a proportional analogy with\nwords, such as carpenter:wood::mason:stone. PairClass represents the semantic\nrelations between two words using a high-dimensional feature vector, in which\nthe elements are based on frequencies of patterns in the corpus. PairClass\nrecognizes analogies by applying standard supervised machine learning\ntechniques to the feature vectors.

In fission yeast cells\nundergoing division, the mitotic spindle spontaneously emerges from the\ninteraction of microtubules, motor proteins and the confining cell walls, and\nasters and vortices have been observed to self-assemble in quasi-two\ndimensional microtubule-kinesin assays. Their is no clear microscopic picture\nof the role of the active motors driving this pattern formation, and the\nrelevance of continuum modeling to filament-scale structures remains uncertain.\nHere we present results of numerical simulations of a discrete filament-motor\nprotein model confined to a pressurised cylindrical box. Stable spindles,\nnematic configurations, asters and high-density semi-asters spontaneously\nemerge, the latter pair having also been observed in cytosol confined within\nemulsion droplets. State diagrams are presented delineating each stationary\nstate as the pressure, motor speed and motor density are varied. We further\nhighlight a parameter regime where vortices form exhibiting collective rotation\nof all filaments, but have a finite life-time before contracting to a\nsemi-aster. Quantifying the distribution of life-times suggests this\ncontraction is a Poisson process. Equivalent systems with fixed volume exhibit\npersistent vortices with stochastic switching in the direction of rotation,\nwith switching times obeying similar statistics to contraction times in\npressurised systems. Furthermore, we show that increasing the detachment rate\nof motors from filament plus-ends can both destroy vortices and turn some\nasters into vortices. Based on our findings we argue the need for a deeper\nunderstanding of the microscopic activities underpinning macroscopic\nself-organization in active gels and urge further experiments to help bridge\nthese lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 16:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

Therefore,\nthis state shows some features usually associated to pygmy resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 18:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We\ndevelop a general theory of tidal excitation of oscillation modes of rotating\nbinary stars, and apply our theory to tidally excited gravity modes (g-modes)\nin KOI-54. The strongest observed oscillations, which occur at 90 and 91 times\nthe orbital frequency, are likely due to prograde m=2 modes (relative to the\nstellar spin axis) locked in resonance with the orbit. The remaining flux\noscillations with frequencies that are integer multiples of the orbital\nfrequency are likely due to nearly resonant m=0 g-modes; such axisymmetric\nmodes generate larger flux variations compared to the m=2 modes, assuming that\nthe spin inclination angle of the star is comparable to the orbital inclination\nangle. We examine the process of resonance mode locking under the combined\neffects of dynamical tides on the stellar spin and orbit and the intrinsic\nstellar spindown. We show that KOI-54 can naturally evolve into a state in\nwhich at least one m=2 mode is locked in resonance with the orbital frequency.\nOur analysis provides an explanation for the fact that only oscillations with\nfrequencies less than 90-100 times the orbital frequency are observed.

For weaker\ndisorder, the channels depin in a single step. For two channels we find\ndynamically induced decoupling transitions that result in coexisting pinned and\nmoving phases as well as moving decoupled phases where particles in both\nchannels move at different average velocities and slide past one another.\nDecoupling can also be induced by changing the relative strength of the\ndisorder in neighboring channels. At higher drives, we observe a dynamical\nrecoupling or locking transition into a state with no relative motion between\nthe channels.This recoupling produces unusual velocity-force signatures,\nincluding negative differential conductivity.

In this letter, we\nexplain how the idea in [5] can be extended to few other linear and non-linear\nfilters [14, 17, 2]. While some of these filters have received a lot of\nattention in recent years, they are known to be computationally intensive. To\nextend the idea in [5], we identify a central property of trigonometric\nfunctions, called shiftability, that allows us to exploit the redundancy\ninherent in the filtering operations. In particular, using shiftable kernels,\nwe show how certain complex filtering can be reduced to simply that of\ncomputing the moving sum of a stack of images. Each image in the stack is\nobtained through an elementary pointwise transform of the input image. This has\na two-fold advantage. First, we can use fast recursive algorithms for computing\nthe moving sum [15, 6], and, secondly, we can use parallel computation to\nfurther speed up the computation.

Specifically, we\nsearched for the H-alpha line emission from galaxies near very strong z=2 MgII\nabsorbers (with rest-frame equivalent width EW>2 \\AA) because these could be\nthe sign-posts of outflows or inflows. Surprisingly, we detect H-alpha from\nonly 4 hosts out of 20 sight-lines (and 2 out of the 19 HI-selected\nsight-lines), despite reaching a star-formation rate (SFR) sensitivity limit of\n2.9 M/yr (5-sigma) for a Chabrier initial mass function. This low success rate\nis in contrast with our z=1 survey where we detected 66%\\ (14/21) of the MgII\nhosts. Taking into account the difference in sensitivity between the two\nsurveys, we should have been able to detect >11.4 of the 20 z=2 hosts whereas\nwe found only 4 galaxies. Interestingly, all the z=2 detected hosts have\nobserved SFR greater than 9 M/yr, well above our sensitivity limit, while at\nz=1 they all have SFR less than 9 M/yr, an evolution that is in good agreement\nwith the evolution of the SFR main sequence. Moreover, we show that the z=2\nundetected hosts are not hidden under the quasar continuum after stacking our\ndata and that they also cannot be outside our surveyed area. Hence, strong MgII\nabsorbers could trace star-formation driven winds in low-mass halos (Mhalo <\n10^{10.6} Msun). Alternatively, our results imply that z=2 galaxies traced by\nstrong MgII absorbers do not form stars at a rate expected (3--10 M/yr) for\ntheir (halo or stellar) masses, supporting the existence of a transition in\naccretion efficiency at Mhalo ~ 10^{11} Msun.

We obtain the exact mean trapping time defined as\nthe average of first-passage time (FPT) from all nodes to the trap, which\nscales linearly with the network order $N$ in large networks. Then, we\ndetermine analytically the mean sending time, which is the mean of the FPTs\nfrom the initial node to all other nodes, and show that it grows with $N$ in\nthe order of $N \\ln N$.

At that frequency, the change of relative\nintensity between the leading and trailing components is the predominant\nfeature of mode switching. The intensity ratios between the leading and\ntrailing components are measured for the individual profiles averaged over a\nfew minutes. It is found that the ratios follow normal distributions, where the\nabnormal mode has a wider typical width than the normal mode, indicating that\nthe abnormal mode is less stable than the normal mode. Our data show that 84.9%\nof the time for PSR B0329+54 was in the normal mode and 15.1% was in the\nabnormal mode. From the two passages of eight-day quasi-continuous observations\nin 2004, and supplemented by the daily data observed with 15 m telescope at 610\nMHz at Jodrell Bank Observatory, the intrinsic distributions of mode timescales\nare constrained with the Bayesian inference method. It is found that the gamma\ndistribution with the shape parameter slightly smaller than 1 is favored over\nthe normal, lognormal and Pareto distributions. The optimal scale parameters of\nthe gamma distribution is 31.5 minutes for the abnormal mode and 154 minutes\nfor the normal mode. The shape parameters have very similar values, i.e.\n0.75^{+0.22}_{-0.17} for the normal mode and 0.84^{+0.28}_{-0.22} for the\nabnormal mode, indicating the physical mechanisms in both modes may be the\nsame. No long-term modulation of the relative intensity ratios was found for\nboth the modes, suggesting that the mode switching was stable. The intrinsic\ntimescale distributions, for the first time constrained for this pulsar,\nprovide valuable information to understand the physics of mode switching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2011 10:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The benefits of the\nBowen-York initial data are the ability to specify the spin and momentum of the\nsystem as parameters of the initial data. In an attempt to extend these\nbenefits to other formulations of the Einstein constraints, the puncture method\nis reformulated using distributions as source terms. It is shown how the\nBowen-York puncture black hole initial data and the trumpet variation is\ngenerated by distributional sources. A heuristic argument is presented to argue\nthat these sources are the general sources of spin and momentum. In order to\nclarify the meaning of other distributional sources, an exact family of initial\ndata with generalized sources to the Hamiltonian constraint are studied;\nspinning trumpet black hole initial data and black hole initial data with\nhigher order momentum sources are also studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2011 13:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Based\non the tree-level expression in the transverse momentum dependent factorization\nframework, we show that the corresponding asymmetry near the $Z$-pole is\nnegative, which is opposite to the asymmetry in the low $Q^2$ region, dominated\nby the production via a virtual photon. We calculate the asymmetry generated by\nthe Boer-Mulders effect near the $Z$-pole at RHIC, with $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV. We\nfind that the magnitude of the asymmetry is several percent, and therefore it\nis measurable. The experimental confirmation of this sign change of the\nasymmetry from the low $Q^2$ region to the $Z$-pole provides direct evidence of\nthe chiral odd structure of quarks inside an unpolarized nucleon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2011 14:39:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 02:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
