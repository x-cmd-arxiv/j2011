When charged\nbodies are placed inside the cloak with an arbitrary distribution, the electric\nfields outside are purely determined by the total charges just as the fields of\na point charge at the center of the cloak. As the total charges reduce to zero,\nthe bodies can not be detected. On the other hand, if the total charges are\nnonzero, the electrostatic potential inside an ideal cloak tends to infinity.\nFor unideal cloaks, this embarrassment is overcome, while they still have good\nbehaviors of shielding.

Two different measures of\nthe impurity contribution to the entanglement have been proposed: the\nimpurity-entanglement-entropy S_{imp} and the negativity N. The first, S_{imp},\nis based on a subtractive procedure where the entanglement-entropy in the\nabsence of the impurity is subtracted from results with the impurity present.\nThe other, N, is the negativity of a part of the system separated from the\nimpurity and the impurity itself. In this paper we compare the two measures and\ndiscuss similarities and differences between them. In the $J-J_2-\\delta$ model\nit is possible to perform very precise variational calculations close to the\nMajumdar-Ghosh-point (J_2 = J / 2 and \\delta = 0) where the system is gapped\nwith a two-fold degenerate dimerized ground-state. We describe in detail how\nsuch calculations are done and how they can be used to calculate N as well as\nS_{imp} for any impurity-coupling J_K. We then study the complete cross-over in\nthe impurity entanglement as J_K is varied between 0 and 1 close to the\nMajumdar-Ghosh-point. In particular we study the impurity entanglement when a\nstaggered nearest-neighbour-interaction proportional to $\\delta$ is introduced.\nIn this case, the two-fold degeneracy of the ground-state is lifted leading to\na very rapid reduction in the impurity entanglement as $\\delta$ is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 19:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 04:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

Supersonic motion, producing\na wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes\nspiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of\nnonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner\narm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated\nshapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis.

In this paper we show that,\nonce baryon number conservation is imposed, color & weak triplet scalars with\nhypercharge $Y=1/3$ can feature the required flavor structure as a consequence\nof standard model gauge invariance. The color & weak triplet model can\nsimultaneously explain the top FBA and the dimuon charge asymmetry or the\ndimuon charge asymmetry and the CDF dijet excess. However, the CDF dijet excess\nappears to be incompatible with the top FBA in the minimal framework. Our model\nfor the dimuon asymmetry predicts the observed pattern $h_d\\ll h_s$ in the\nregion of parameter space required to explain the top FBA, whereas our model\nfor the CDF dijet anomaly is characterized by the absence of beyond the SM\nb-quark jets in the excess region. Compatibility of the color & weak triplet\nwith the electroweak constraints is also discussed. We show that a Higgs boson\nmass exceeding the LEP bound is typically favored in this scenario, and that\nboth Higgs production and decay can be significantly altered by the triplet.\nThe most promising collider signature is found if the splitting among the\ncomponents of the triplet is of weak scale magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 20:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 12:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The presence of tiny grains in PPDs thus raises the\nquestion of whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is able to drive\nrapid accretion to be consistent with observations. Charged tiny grains have\nsimilar conduction properties as ions, whose presence leads to qualitatively\nnew behaviors in the conductivity tensor, characterized by n_bar/n_e>1, where\nn_e and n_bar denote the number densities of free electrons and all other\ncharged species respectively. In particular, Ohmic conductivity becomes\ndominated by charged grains rather than electrons when n_bar/n_e exceeds about\n10^3, and Hall and ambipolar diffusion (AD) coefficients are reduced by a\nfactor of (n_bar/n_e)^2 in the AD dominated regime relative to that in the\nOhmic regime. Applying the methodology of Bai (2011), we find that in PPDs,\nwhen PAHs are sufficiently abundant (>1e-9 per H_2), there exists a transition\nradius r_trans of about 10-20 AU, beyond which the MRI active layer extends to\nthe disk midplane. At r<r_trans, the optimistically predicted MRI-driven\naccretion rate M_dot is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the\ngrain-free case, which is too small compared with the observed rates, but is in\ngeneral no smaller than the predicted M_dot with solar-abundance 0.1 micron\ngrains. At r>r_trans, we find that remarkably, the predicted M_dot exceeds the\ngrain-free case due to a net reduction of AD by charged tiny grains, and\nreaches a few times 1e-8M_Sun/yr. This is sufficient to account for the\nobserved M_dot in transitional disks. Larger grains (>0.1 micron) are too\nmassive to reach such high abundance as tiny grains and to facilitate the\naccretion process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 20:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Softening of the\ngravitational force is introduced in collisionless simulations to limit the\nimportance of close encounters between these particles. The scale of softening\nis generally fixed and chosen as a compromise between the need for high spatial\nresolution and the need to limit the particle noise. In the scenario of\ncosmological simulations, where the density field evolves to a highly\ninhomogeneous state, this compromise results in an appropriate choice only for\na certain class of objects, the others being subject to either a biased or a\nnoisy dynamical description.

The novelty of the algorithm lies in its hierarchical\napproach, which leads to a minimal set of veto conditions with high performance\nand low deadtime. After a given channel has been selected it is used to veto\ntriggers from the detector output, then the algorithm selects a new channel\nthat performs well on the remaining triggers and the process is repeated. This\nmethod has been demonstrated to reduce the background in searches for transient\ngravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 20:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-16"}

In one case the bands that determine the FS's arise from\nstrongly hybridized degenerate dxz and dyz orbitals, while in the other the two\nbands are determined by non-degenerate and non-hybridized s-like orbitals.\nUsing a variety of techniques, in the weak coupling regime it is shown that\nonly the model with hybridized bands develops metallic magnetic order, while\nthe other model exhibits an ordered excitonic orbital-transverse spin state\nthat is insulating and does not have a local magnetization. However, both\nmodels display similar insulating magnetic stripe ordering in the strong\ncoupling limit. These results indicate that nesting is a necessary but not\nsufficient condition for the development of ordered states with finite local\nmagnetization in multiorbital Hubbard systems; the additional ingredient\nappears to be that the nested portions of the bands need to have the same\norbital flavor. This condition can be achieved via strong hybridization of the\norbitals in weak coupling or via the FS reconstruction induced by the Coulomb\ninteractions in the strong coupling regime. This effect also impacts the\npairing symmetry as demonstrated by the study of the dominant pairing channels\nfor the two models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 22:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}

We study the growth and evolution of individual HII, HeII\nand HeIII regions around early galaxies with first stars and/or QSO\npopulations. We find that in the presence of helium-ionizing radiation, X-rays\nmay not dominate the ionization and thermal history of the IGM at redshifts, z,\nof 10-20, contributing relatively modest increases to IGM ionization, and\nheating up to about 10^3--10^5 K in IGM temperatures.

At times shorter than\nboth relevant time scales, the flight time and \\hslash/U, the major effect of\nthe electric field is to create electron - hole pairs, i.e. causing interband\ntransitions. In linear response this leads (for width W>>L) to conductivity\npi/2 e^{2}/h. On the other hand, at times lager than the two scales the\nmechanism and value are different. It is shown that the conductivity approaches\nits intraband value, equal to the one obtained within the Landauer-Butticker\napproach resulting from evanescent waves. It is equal to 4/pi e^{2}/h for W>>L.\nThe interband transitions, within linear response, are unimportant in this\nlimit. Between these extremes there is a crossover behaviour dependent on the\nratio between the two time scales. At strong electric fields (beyond linear\nreponse) the interband process dominates. The electron-hole mechanism is\nuniversal, namely does not depend on geometry (aspect ratio, topology of\nboundary conditions, properties of leads), while the evanescent modes mechanism\ndepends on all of them. On basis of the results we determine, that while in\nabsorption measurements and in DC transport in suspended graphene the first\nconductivity value was measured, the latter one would appear in experiments on\nsmall ballistic graphene flakes on substrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 10:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In deposits of non-cohesive\nrods in 2D, the topology of the packing is mainly dominated by the formation of\nordered structures of aligned rods. Elongated particles tend to align\nhorizontally and the stress is mainly transmitted from top to bottom, revealing\nan asymmetric distribution of local stress. However, for deposits of cohesive\nparticles, the preferred horizontal orientation disappears. Very elongated\nparticles with strong attractive forces form extremely loose structures,\ncharacterized by an orientation distribution, which tends to a uniform behavior\nwhen increasing the Bond number. As a result of these changes, the pressure\ndistribution in the deposits changes qualitatively. The isotropic part of the\nlocal stress is notably enhanced with respect to the deviatoric part, which is\nrelated to the gravity direction. Consequently, the lateral stress transmission\nis dominated by the enhanced disorder and leads to a faster pressure saturation\nwith depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 10:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-18"}

Our analysis demonstrated that the series should be assigned to\nemission of van der Waals (N2)2 dimers from inside clusters. Earlier, such\ndimers were only observed in molecular beams and gaseous nitrogen, this paper\nreports their observation in the solid phase of nitrogen suggesting that they\nmay be the basic building blocks of small N2 clusters. Our results can be of\ninterest from the viewpoint of producing polymeric nitrogen since (N2)2 dimers\ncan be considered to be a starting species for its synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 12:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 10:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-27"}

In short, a user searching for a target object\nnavigates through a database in the following manner: the user is asked to\nselect the object most similar to her target from a small list of objects. A\nnew object list is then presented to the user based on her earlier selection.\nThis process is repeated until the target is included in the list presented, at\nwhich point the search terminates. This problem is known to be strongly related\nto the small-world network design problem.\n  However, contrary to prior work, which focuses on cases where objects in the\ndatabase are equally popular, we consider here the case where the demand for\nobjects may be heterogeneous. We show that, under heterogeneous demand, the\nsmall-world network design problem is NP-hard. Given the above negative result,\nwe propose a novel mechanism for small-world design and provide an upper bound\non its performance under heterogeneous demand. The above mechanism has a\nnatural equivalent in the context of content search through comparisons, and we\nestablish both an upper bound and a lower bound for the performance of this\nmechanism. These bounds are intuitively appealing, as they depend on the\nentropy of the demand as well as its doubling constant, a quantity capturing\nthe topology of the set of target objects. They also illustrate interesting\nconnections between comparison-based search to classic results from information\ntheory. Finally, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm for content search\nthat meets the performance guarantees achieved by the above mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 12:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 19:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 07:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

In a breakthrough\nresult Reed, Smith, and Vetta (Operations Research Letters, 2004) gave a\n$\\BigOh(4^kkmn)$ time algorithm for it, the first algorithm with polynomial\nruntime of uniform degree for every fixed $k$. It is known that this implies a\npolynomial-time compression algorithm that turns OCT instances into equivalent\ninstances of size at most $\\BigOh(4^k)$, a so-called kernelization. Since then\nthe existence of a polynomial kernel for OCT, i.e., a kernelization with size\nbounded polynomially in $k$, has turned into one of the main open questions in\nthe study of kernelization.\n  This work provides the first (randomized) polynomial kernelization for OCT.\nWe introduce a novel kernelization approach based on matroid theory, where we\nencode all relevant information about a problem instance into a matroid with a\nrepresentation of size polynomial in $k$. For OCT, the matroid is built to\nallow us to simulate the computation of the iterative compression step of the\nalgorithm of Reed, Smith, and Vetta, applied (for only one round) to an\napproximate odd cycle transversal which it is aiming to shrink to size $k$.

In particular,\nthe baryon (meson) emission patterns are consistent with a scenario in which a\nbulk medium of flowing quarks coalesces into three-quark (two-quark) \"bags.\"\nWhile a full understanding of this number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling\nremains elusive, it is suggestive of a thermalized bulk system characterized by\ncolored dynamical degrees of freedom-- a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this\nscenario, one expects the scaling to break down as the central energy density\nis reduced below the QGP formation threshold; for this reason, NCQ-scaling\nviolation searches are of interest in the energy scan program at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). However, as $\\roots$ is reduced, it is\nnot only the initial energy density that changes; there is also an increase in\nthe net baryon number at midrapidity, as stopping transports entrance-channel\npartons to midrapidity. This phenomenon can result in violations of simple NCQ\nscaling. Still in the context of the quark coalescence model, we describe a\nspecific pattern for the break-down of the scaling that includes different flow\nstrengths for particles and their anti-partners. Related complications in the\nsearch for recently suggested exotic phenomena are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 14:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 19:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

To observe polarization of the\nprompt X-ray emission of a Gamma-ray burst (GRB), a large area detector is\nneeded. Diffusion of the electron cloud in a standard TPC could be prohibitive\nto measuring good modulation when the drift distance is large. Therefore, we\npropose using a negative ion TPC (NITPC) with Nitromethane (CH3NO2) as the\nelectron capture agent. The diffusion of negative ions is reduced over that of\nelectrons due to the thermal coupling of the negative ions to the surrounding\ngas. This allows for larger area detectors as the drift distance can be\nincreased without degrading polarimeter modulation. Negative ions also travel\n~200 times slower than electrons, allowing the readout electronics to operate\nslower, resulting in a reduction of instrument power. To optimize the NITPC\ndesign, we have measured gas gain with SciEnergy gas electron multipliers\n(GEMs) in single and double GEM configurations.

Importantly, the precision\nof this timing is not only affected by radiometer noise, but also by intrinsic\npulse shape changes, interstellar medium (ISM) evolution, instrumental\ndistortions, etc. In this paper we review the known causes of pulse shape\nvariations and assess their effect on the precision and accuracy of a single\nmeasurement of pulse arrival time with current instrumentation. Throughout this\nanalysis we use the brightest and most precisely timed millisecond pulsar\n(MSP), PSR J0437-4715, as a case study, and develop a set of diagnostic tools\nto evaluate profile stability in timing observations. We conclude that most\ncauses of distortion can be either corrected by state-of-the-art techniques or\ntaken into account in the estimation of time-of-arrival (TOA) uncertainties.\nThe advent of a new generation of radio telescopes (e.g. the Square Kilometre\nArray, SKA), and their increase in collecting area has sparked speculation\nabout the timing precision achievable through increases in gain. Based on our\nanalysis of current data, we predict that for normal-brightness MSPs a TOA\nprecision of between 80 and 230 ns can be achieved at 1.4 GHz with 10-minute\nintegrations by the SKA. The actual rms timing residuals for each pulsar will\nbe approximately at the same level only if all the other influences on timing\nprecision (e.g. ISM, spin noise) are either corrected, modelled, or negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 15:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Unlike classical, equilibrium information\ntheory, information envelopes focus on the dynamics of sources and coders,\nusing functions of time that bound the number of bits generated. In the limit\nthe information envelopes converge to the average behavior and recover the\nentropy of a source, respectively, the average codeword length of a coder. In\ncontrast, on short time scales and for sources with memory it is shown that\nlarge deviations from known equilibrium results occur with non-negligible\nprobability. These can cause significant network delays. Compared to well-known\ntraffic models from queueing theory, information envelopes consider the\nfunctioning of information sources and coders, avoiding a priori assumptions,\nsuch as exponential traffic, or empirical, trace-based traffic models. Using\nresults from the stochastic network calculus, the envelopes yield a\ncharacterization of the operating points of source coders by the triplet of\ncapacity, delay, and error. In the limit, assuming an optimal coder the\nrequired capacity approaches the entropy with arbitrarily small probability of\nerror if infinitely large delays are permitted. We derive a corresponding\ncharacterization of channels and prove that the model has the desirable\nproperty of additivity, that allows analyzing coders and channels separately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 15:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
