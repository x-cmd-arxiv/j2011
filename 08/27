Our formula is the channel analog of a well-known formula for the\nentanglement cost of quantum states in terms of the entanglement of formation;\nand shares a similar relation to the recently shattered hope for additivity.\nThe entanglement cost of a quantum channel can be seen as the analog of the\nquantum reverse Shannon theorem in the case where free classical communication\nis allowed.

We discuss\ntwo applications of our result. First, we are able to link the security in the\nnoisy-storage model to a problem of sending quantum rather than classical\ninformation through the adversary's storage device. This not only improves the\nrange of parameters where security can be shown, but also allows us to prove\nsecurity for storage devices for which no results were known before.

Recently, this problem has been formulated as recovering a\nlow-rank component and a sparse component from the observed data matrix. It is\nproved that under some suitable conditions, this problem can be exactly solved\nby principal component pursuit (PCP), i.e., minimizing a combination of nuclear\nnorm and $l_1$ norm. Most of the existing methods for solving PCP require\nsingular value decompositions (SVD) of the data matrix, resulting in a high\ncomputational complexity, hence preventing the applications of RPCA to very\nlarge scale computer vision problems. In this paper, we propose a novel\nalgorithm, called $l_1$ filtering, for \\emph{exactly} solving PCP with an\n$O(r^2(m+n))$ complexity, where $m\\times n$ is the size of data matrix and $r$\nis the rank of the matrix to recover, which is supposed to be much smaller than\n$m$ and $n$.

The simulations follow the formation and dissociation of\nmolecular hydrogen, and include star formation only in cold molecular gas. The\nmolecular gas is more concentrated towards the center of galaxies than the\natomic gas, and as a consequence, the resulting stellar distribution is very\ncompact. For halos with total mass above 10^{11} Mo, the median half-mass\nradius of the stellar disks is 0.8 kpc at z = 3. The vertical structure of the\nmolecular disk is much thinner than that of the atomic neutral gas. Relative to\nthe non-radiative run, the inner regions of the dark matter halo change shape\nfrom prolate to mildly oblate and align with the stellar disk. However, we do\nnot find evidence for a significant dark disk of dark matter around the stellar\ndisk. The outer halo regions retain the orientation acquired during accretion\nand mergers, and are significantly misaligned with the inner regions. The\nradial profile of the dark matter halo contracts in response to baryon\ndissipation, establishing an approximately isothermal profile throughout most\nof the halo. This effect can be accurately described by a modified model of\nhalo contraction. The angular momentum of a fixed amount of inner dark matter\nis approximately conserved over time, while in the dissipationless case most of\nit is transferred outward during mergers. The conservation of the dark matter\nangular momentum provides supporting evidence for the validity of the halo\ncontraction model in a hierarchical galaxy formation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2011 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-21"}

In addition, since these visualization tools are not\nopen-source software there is always a problem with developing a common\nlanguage for the interpretation of data. In this contribution we present\nresults of our work on using an open-source advanced interactive visualization\nsoftware tool, which overcomes the difficulty of visualizing larger data sets\nby supporting parallel rendering on a graphical user interface or script user\ninterface and permits quantitative analysis of atom probe tomography data in\nreal time.

In life sciences, combinatorial optimization problems frequently\narise in molecular biology, e.g., genome sequencing; global alignment of\nmultiple genomes; identifying siblings or discovery of dysregulated pathways.In\nalmost all of these problems, there is the need for proving a hypothesis about\ncertain property of an object that can be present only when it adopts some\nparticular admissible structure (an NP-certificate) or be absent (no admissible\nstructure), however, none of the standard approaches can discard the hypothesis\nwhen no solution can be found, since none can provide a proof that there is no\nadmissible structure. This article presents an algorithm that introduces a\nnovel type of solution method to \"efficiently\" solve the graph 3-coloring\nproblem; an NP-complete problem. The proposed method provides certificates\n(proofs) in both cases: present or absent, so it is possible to accept or\nreject the hypothesis on the basis of a rigorous proof. It provides exact\nsolutions and is polynomial-time (i.e., efficient) however parametric. The only\nrequirement is sufficient computational power, which is controlled by the\nparameter $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Nevertheless, here it is proved that the\nprobability of requiring a value of $\\alpha>k$ to obtain a solution for a\nrandom graph decreases exponentially: $P(\\alpha>k) \\leq 2^{-(k+1)}$, making\ntractable almost all problem instances. Thorough experimental analyses were\nperformed. The algorithm was tested on random graphs, planar graphs and\n4-regular planar graphs.

This theory shows that, in spite of the unitary evolution, a\nsteady state is established after a Markovian transient stage. This study\nsuggests that if a quantum dynamics is developed in a composite Hilbert space\n(i.e. the tensor product of several sub-spaces) then the behavior of an\noperator that only belongs to one of the sub-spaces may camouflage the unitary\ncharacter of the global evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2011 02:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

We consider two representative problems that validate a\nhybrid method and also show that this method captures the combined effects of\nnonlinearity and stochasticity. We first validate a simple\ndeposition/dissolution model with a linear rate showing that the KMC-continuum\nhybrid agrees with both a fully deterministic model and its analytical\nsolution. We then study a deposition/dissolution model including competitive\nadsorption, which leads to a nonlinear rate, and show that, in this case, the\nKMC-continuum hybrid and fully deterministic simulations do not agree. However,\nwe are able to identify the difference as a natural result of the stochasticity\ncoming from the KMC surface process. Because KMC captures inherent\nfluctuations, we consider it to be more realistic than a purely deterministic\nmodel. Therefore, we consider the KMC-continuum hybrid to be more\nrepresentative of a real system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2011 21:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Chew","title":"Gravity Sources in a Quantum Milne Universe","comments":null,"journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"gr-qc","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  A quantum-cosmology-suited sliced Milne spacetime, located inside a\n'big-bang' forward lightcone, comprises the interiors of a sequence of\n4-dimensional slices whose invariant 'age' width is at Planck scale. The age of\nany lightcone-interior point is its Minkowski distance from the lightcone\nvertex, but excluded from the spacetime of a 'quantum Milne universe' (QMU) are\n3-dimensional slice-separating, ray-carrying hyperboloids. Each (fixed-age)\nslice boundary houses a Gelfand-Naimark unitarily Lorentz-transformable\ncosmological-Fock-space ray-a sum of tensor products of complex normed\nfiber-bundle 'source' functions. Each bundle is a unit 3-sphere (fiber) over an\ninvariantly metricized 3-hyperboloid (base space). The evolving QMU comprises a\nslice-interior sequence (each interior a 4-manifold) and a ray sequence housed\nby the slice-separating 3-manifolds. Throughout each slice interior, the\npreceding ray specifies classical-field reality. Action, of\nelsewhere-prescribed slice-traversing Feynman paths, determines any ray after\nthe first from its predecessor. QMUs related by a global 7-parameter Lie-group\nsymmetry transformation, at fixed age, are equivalent--the same quantum\nuniverse. This 'cosmological relativity' implies vanishing of total universe\nangular momentum (Mach's principle) as well as of total universe momentum.\nMilne's cosmological principle accompanies vanishing of total-universe energy.\n(Seven 'Noether-conserved' quantities separately aggregate to zero).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2011 21:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}
