The yield of fission products is\ncalculated using the statistical model based on the driving potentials for the\nfissionable system. The minima of potential energy of the decaying system\ncorrespond to the charge numbers of the products which are produced with large\nprobabilities in the sequential fission (partial case of the collinear cluster\ntripartition) of the compound nucleus. The realization of this mechanism\nsupposes the asymmetric fission channel as the first stage of sequential\nmechanism. It is shown that only the use of the driving potential calculated by\nthe binding energies with the shell correction allows us to explain the yield\nof the true ternary fission products. The theoretical model is applied to\nresearch collinear cluster tripartition in the reaction $^{235}$U(n$_{\\rm\nth}$,f). Calculations showed that in the first stage of this fission reaction,\nthe isotopes $^{82}$Ge and $^{154}$Nd are formed with relatively large\nprobabilities and in the second stage of sequential fission of the isotope Nd\nmainly Ni and Ge are formed. This is in agreement with the yield of the isotope\n$^{68}$Ni which is observed as the product of the collinear cluster\ntripartition in the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2011 16:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

Rate allocation is a key problem in\nwireless network design, but a very challenging problem because: (i) wireless\ninterference is global, i.e., a transmission interferes all other simultaneous\ntransmissions, and (ii) the rate-power relation is non-convex and\nnon-continuous, where the discontinuity is due to limited number of\ncoding-modulation choices in practical systems. In this paper, we propose a\ndistributed power control and coding-modulation adaptation algorithm using\nannealed Gibbs sampling, which achieves throughput optimality in an arbitrary\nnetwork topology. We consider a realistic\nSignal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio (SINR) based interference model, and\nassume continuous power space and finite rate options (coding-modulation\nchoices). Our algorithm first decomposes network-wide interference to local\ninterference by properly choosing a \"neighborhood\" for each transmitter and\nbounding the interference from non-neighbor nodes. The power update policy is\nthen carefully designed to emulate a Gibbs sampler over a Markov chain with a\ncontinuous state space. We further exploit the technique of simulated annealing\nto speed up the convergence of the algorithm to the optimal power and\ncoding-modulation configuration. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2011 20:17:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 03:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-24"}

In a first step, we\npropose to model the statistical distribution of groundwater age at aquifer\nscale by means of the classical advection-dispersion equation for a\nconservative and nonreactive tracer, associated to proper boundary conditions.\nThe evaluated function corresponds to the density of probability of the random\nvariable age, age being defined as the time elapsed since the water particles\nentered the aquifer. An adjoint backward model is introduced to characterize\nthe life expectancy distribution, life expectancy being the time remaining\nbefore leaving the aquifer. By convolution of these two distributions,\ngroundwater transit time distributions, from inlet to outlet, are fully defined\nfor the entire aquifer domain. In a second step, an accurate and efficient\nmethod is introduced to simulate the transit time distribution at discharge\nzones. By applying the reservoir theory to advective-dispersive aquifer\nsystems, we demonstrate that the discharge zone transit time distribution can\nbe evaluated if the internal age probability distribution is known. The\nreservoir theory also applies to internal life expectancy probabilities\nyielding the recharge zone life expectancy distribution. Internal groundwater\nvolumes are finally identified with respect to age and transit time.

Therefore, the\ntransformations from the prefered frame to the non-prefered frame are replaced\nby the corresponding total differentials. A formula for the Doppler frequency\nresidual is derived. It is applied to the prefered frame of the Earth and the\nnon-prefered frame of the rotating Earth. The resulting Doppler residual\ndepends on the direction of the velocity of the spacecraft and the position of\nthe observer on the rotating Earth. It is similar to the experimental formula\nof Anderson et al. which is independent of the position of the observer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2011 10:23:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 13:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}
