The delays originate close to the black hole. Here, we show\nthat RE J1034+396 shows very similar lag properties. At low frequencies (< 1\n\\times 10-4 Hz), the time lag between energy bands increases with energy\nseparation, similar to that commonly seen in Galactic black holes and other\nAGN. At higher frequencies (~ 3.5 \\times 10-4 Hz), the soft (< 1 keV) and hard\n(> 3 keV) bands lag behind the intermediate band (1-3 keV). The simplest\ninterpretation is that the intermediate band is dominated by the direct\npower-law continuum, while the soft and hard bands are dominated by the\nrelativistically-smeared reflected emission. The low frequency delays are\npresent in both available observations. The high frequency lags are only seen\nin one observation. In the observation where high frequency reverberation\ndelays are observed, the spectrum contains a power-law component and there is a\nQPO in the light curve. In the other observation, no power-law component is\nrequired and no QPO is seen. The lags originate a few gravitational radii from\nthe black hole, and the QPO is associated with the power-law emitting corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 16:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The two-dimensional kagome\ncrystal and its three-dimensional counterpart, the pyrochlore crystal, have\nbeen extensively studied in the context of geometric frustration in\nantiferromagnetic materials. Similarly, the polymorphs of elemental carbon\ninclude the diamond crystal and the corresponding two-dimensional honeycomb\nstructure, adopted by graphene. The kagome crystal in d Euclidean dimensions\nconsists of vertex-sharing d-dimensional simplices in which all of the points\nare topologically equivalent. The d-dimensional generalization of the diamond\ncrystal can then be obtained from the centroids of each of the simplices, and\nwe show that this natural construction of the diamond crystal is distinct from\nthe D_d^+ family of crystals for all dimensions d\\neq 3. We analyze the\nstructural properties of these high-dimensional crystals, including the packing\ndensities, coordination numbers, void exclusion probability functions, covering\nradii, and quantizer errors. Our results demonstrate that the so-called\ndecorrelation principle, which formally states that unconstrained correlations\nvanish in asymptotically high dimensions, remarkably applies to the case of\nperiodic point patterns with inherent long-range order. We show that the\ndecorrelation principle is already exhibited in periodic crystals in low\ndimensions via a \"smoothed\" pair correlation function obtained by convolution\nwith a Gaussian kernel. These observations support the universality of the\ndecorrelation principle for any point pattern in high dimensions, whether\ndisordered or not. This universal property in turn suggests that the best\nconjectural lower bound on the maximal sphere-packing density in high Euclidean\ndimensions derived by Torquato and Stillinger [Expt.

The classical control landscape\ncorresponding to this objective is a functional of the control field, and the\ntopology of the landscape is analyzed through its gradient and Hessian with\nrespect to the control. Under specific assumptions on the regularity of the\ncontrol fields, the classical control landscape is found to be free of traps\nthat could hinder reaching the objective. The Hessian associated with an\noptimal control field is shown to have finite rank, indicating the presence of\nan inherent degree of robustness to control noise. Extensive numerical\nsimulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical principles on a) a\nmodel diatomic molecule, b) two coupled Morse oscillators, and c) a chaotic\nsystem with a coupled quartic oscillator, confirming the absence of traps in\nthe classical control landscape. We compare the classical formulation with the\nmathematically analogous state-to-state transition probability control\nlandscape of N-level quantum systems.

Although our methods are general,\nwe focus on the recently discovered Kepler system KOI-54, a face-on binary of\ntwo A stars with $e=0.83$ and an orbital period of 42 days. KOI-54 exhibits\nstrong ellipsoidal variability during its periastron passage; its lightcurve\nalso contains ~20 pulsations at perfect harmonics of the orbital frequency, and\nanother ~10 nonharmonic pulsations. Analysis of such data is a new form of\nasteroseismology in which oscillation amplitudes and phases rather than\nfrequencies contain information that can be mined to constrain stellar\nproperties. We qualitatively explain the physics of mode excitation and the\nrange of harmonics expected to be observed. To quantitatively model observed\npulsation spectra, we develop and apply a linear, tidally forced, nonadiabatic\nstellar oscillation formalism including the Coriolis force. We produce temporal\npower spectra for KOI-54 that are semi-quantitatively consistent with the\nobservations. Both stars in the KOI-54 system are expected to be rotating\npseudosynchronously, with resonant nonaxisymmetric modes providing a key\ncontribution to the total torque; such resonances provide a possible\nexplanation for the two largest-amplitude harmonic pulsations observed in\nKOI-54, although we find quantitative problems with this interpretation. We\nshow in detail that the nonharmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54 can be\nproduced by nonlinear three-mode coupling. The methods developed in this paper\ncan be generalized in the future to determine the best-fit stellar parameters\ngiven pulsation data.

We measure the equivalent width of Lick indices out to 20 kpc\nfrom the center of NGC 3311 and fit them with stellar population models that\naccount for the [alpha/Fe] overabundance.\n  Results. Stars in the dynamically hot halo of NGC 3311 are old (age > 13\nGyr), metal-poor ([Z/H] ~ -0.35), and alpha-enhanced ([alpha/Fe] ~ 0.48).\nTogether with the high velocity dispersion, these measurements indicate that\nthe stars in the halo were accreted from the outskirts of other early-type\ngalaxies, with a possible contribution from dwarf galaxies.

We find a clear distinction in the observed trends of\nthe giant and dwarf galaxies. The ages of red-sequence giants are primarily\ndetermined by galaxy mass, with only weak modulation by environment, in the\nsense that galaxies at larger cluster-centric distance are slightly younger.\nFor red-sequence dwarfs (with mass <10^10 Msun), the roles of mass and\nenvironment as predictors of age are reversed: there is little dependence on\nmass, but strong trends with projected cluster-centric radius are observed. The\naverage age of dwarfs at the 2.5 Mpc limit of our sample is approximately half\nthat of dwarfs near the cluster centre. The gradient in dwarf galaxy ages is a\nglobal cluster-centric trend, and is not driven by the ongoing merger of the\nNGC 4839 group to the south west of Coma.

Observational campaigns\nhave dramatically increased the sample of known LAEs, which now extends out to\nz=7. These discoveries have motivated numerous theoretical studies on the\nsubject, which usually define LAEs in their models based on sharp Ly{\\alpha}\nluminosity and equivalent width (EW) cuts. While broadly representative, this\nprocedure does not mimic the selection from observational programs in detail,\nwhich instead use cuts in various colour-spaces. We investigate what\nimplications this disjoint may have for studies that aim to model LAEs. We\nconstruct an empirical model for the number density of star forming galaxies as\na function of their UV and Ly{\\alpha} luminosity, utilising measured\nconstraints on the luminosity functions (LFs) of drop-out galaxies, and their\nluminosity dependent probability distribution function of Ly{\\alpha} EW. In\nparticular, we investigate whether the LAE LFs can be reproduced by defining\nLAEs using a (z-dependent) Ly{\\alpha} luminosity and EW threshold. While we are\nable to reproduce the observed distribution of Ly{\\alpha} EW among LAEs out to\nrestframe EW 200 A, we find that our formalism over-predicts both the UV and\nLy{\\alpha} LFs of LAEs by a factor of 2-3, and is inconsistent with\nobservations at the ~95% level. This tension is partially resolved if we assume\nthe Ly{\\alpha} EW-distribution of drop-out galaxies to be truncated at\nrestframe EW>150 A. However the overprediction indicates that modeling LAEs\nwith simple REW and luminosity cuts does not accurately mimic observed\nselection criteria, and can lead to uncertainties in the predicted number\ndensity of LAEs. On the other hand, the predicted z-evolution is not affected.\nWe apply our formalism to drop-out galaxies at z>6, and predict the LFs of LAEs\nat z=7-9.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 20:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 09:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

It\nis this type of observational information that is critical for guiding\nastrochemical models, as the spatial distribution of molecules and their\nrelation to energetic sources will govern the chemical mechanisms at play in\nstar-forming regions. We have conducted millimeter imaging studies of Orion-KL\nwith various beam sizes using CARMA in order to investigate the continuum\nstructure. These \\lambda;=3mm observations have synthesized beam sizes of\n~0.5\"-5.0\". These observations reveal the complex continuum structure of this\nregion, which stands in sharp contrast to the previous structural models\nassumed for Orion-KL based on lower spatial resolution images. The new results\nindicate that the spatial scaling previously used in determination of molecular\nabundances for this region are in need of complete revision. Here we present\nthe results of the continuum observations, discuss the sizes and structures of\nthe detected sources, and suggest an observational strategy for determining the\nproper spatial scaling to accurately determine molecular abundances in the\nOrion-KL region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 21:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Our starting point is\nthe Dirac and Maxwell equations that describe respectively the one-particle\nstates of localized massive fermions and photons. In the WKB limit we show how\none can isolate a two-dimensional quantum state which evolves unitarily along\n\\Gamma. The quantum states for these two realizations are represented by a\nleft-handed 2-spinor in the case of massive fermions and a four-component\ncomplex polarization vector in the case of photons. In addition we show how to\nobtain from this WKB approach a fully general relativistic description of\ngravitationally induced phases. We use this formalism to describe the\ngravitational shift in the COW 1975 experiment. In the non-relativistic weak\nfield limit our result reduces to the standard formula in the original paper.\nWe provide a concrete physical model for a Stern-Gerlach measurement of spin\nand obtain a unique spin operator which can be determined given the orientation\nand velocity of the Stern-Gerlach device and velocity of the massive fermion.\nFinally, we consider multipartite states and generalize the formalism to\nincorporate basic elements from quantum information theory such as quantum\nentanglement, quantum teleportation, and identical particles. The resulting\nformalism provides a basis for exploring precision quantum measurements of the\ngravitational field using techniques from quantum information theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 05:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 04:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 13:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-05"}

Given the\nSFRs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 M_sun/yr, this timescale implies final\nstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 M_sun. The corresponding stellar mass\nfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies at\nz>1. The comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and UV selected galaxies\nsuggests that the dust-free, UV bright phase, is >10^2 times shorter than the\nsub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset of\nstar formation. Using a single reference Spectral Energy Distribution (SED; the\none of the z~2.3 galaxy SMM J2135-0102), our simple physical model is able to\nreproduce not only the LFs at different redshifts > 1 but also the counts at\nwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. Owing to the steepness of the\ncounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests that\nthe dispersion of sub-mm SEDs of z>1 galaxies around the reference one is\nrather small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 07:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

However, in order to convince data owners that\ntheir data are well protected while being shared among cloud users, the cloud\nplatform needs to provide flexible mechanisms for the users to express the\nconstraints (access rules) subject to which the data should be shared, and\nlikewise, enforce them effectively. We study a comprehensive set of practical\nscenarios where data sharing needs to be enforced by methods such as\naggregation, windowed frame, value constrains, etc., and observe that existing\nbasic access control mechanisms do not provide adequate flexibility to enable\neffective data sharing in a secure and controlled manner.

We perform a stacking of the submm\ndata around the AGN, which we group by estimated column density, and find that\nonly the obscured (N_H > 10^22 cm^2) AGN show significant associated submm\nemission. These observations support the previous findings of Page et al and\nHill et al that obscured AGN preferentially show submm emission. Hill et al\nhave argued that, in this case, the contribution to the observed submm emission\n(and thus the submm background) from AGN heating of the dust in these sources\nmay be higher than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 09:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 20:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-31"}

To study the condensate we use the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, with arbitrary non-linearity. By introducing the\nMadelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the dynamics of the\nsystem in terms of the continuity equation and of the hydrodynamic Euler\nequations. The non-relativistic and Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational\ncondensate can be described as a gas, whose density and pressure are related by\na barotropic equation of state. In the case of a condensate with quartic\nnon-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic with index one. In the\nframework of the Thomas-Fermi approximation the structure of the Newtonian\ngravitational condensate is described by the Lane-Emden equation, which can be\nexactly solved. The case of the rotating condensate is also discussed. General\nrelativistic configurations with quartic non-linearity are studied numerically\nwith both non-relativistic and relativistic equations of state, and the maximum\nmass of the stable configuration is determined. Condensates with particle\nmasses of the order of two neutron masses (Cooper pair) and scattering length\nof the order of 10-20 fm have maximum masses of the order of 2 M_sun, maximum\ncentral density of the order of 0.1-0.3 10^16 g/cm^3 and minimum radii in the\nrange of 10-20 km.
