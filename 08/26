With quantum\neffects a motion of a particle through a barrier is allowed due to quantum\ntunneling. According to usual theories of tunneling, the particle density\ndecays inside a classical barrier resulting in an extremely slow pentration\nprocess. However, there are no general laws forbidding fast motion through\nclassical barriers. The problem addressed is investigation of unusual features\no quantum tunneling through a classic static barrier which is at least\ntwo-dimensional. Here we show that penetration through such barrier can be not\nslow. When the barrier satisfies the certain conditions, a regime of quantum\nlens is possible with formation of caustics. De Broglie waves are reflected\nfrom the caustics, interfere, and result in a not small flux from under the\nbarrier. This strongly contrasts to the usual scenario with a decaying\nunder-barrier density. We construct a particular example of fast motion through\na classical barrier. One can unexectedly conclude that, in principle, nature\nallows fast penetration through classical barriers which against common sense.\nThe phenomenon may be responsible for a variety of processes in labs and\nnature. For example, tunneling in solids may occur with a different scenario,\nin biophysics and chemistry one can specify conditions for unusual reactions,\nand evanescent optical waves may strongly change their properties. In condensed\nmatter and cosmic physics there are phenomena with misterious reasons of an\nenergy emission, for instance, gamma-ray bursts. One can try to treat them in\nthe context of fast escape from under some barriers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 18:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-26"}

We obtain a spatial resolution of about 20 pc and thus directly\nresolve the sphere of gravitational influence of the massive black hole. We\nexplore two different methods to measure the black hole mass. Using a Jeans\nAxisymmetric Multi-Gaussian mass model, we investigate the limit that a relaxed\nmass distribution produces all of the measured velocity dispersion, and find an\nupper limit on the black hole mass at $2.0 \\pm 0.2 \\times 10^9 M_{\\sun}$. When\nassuming the young stars whose spectra we observe remain in a thin disk, we\ncompare Keplerian velocity fields to the measured two-dimensional velocity\nfield measured and fit for a mass profile containing a black hole point mass\nplus a radially-varying spherical component, which suggests a lower limit for\nthe black hole mass of $8.7 \\pm 0.3 \\times 10^8 M_{\\sun}$. Our measurements of\nthe stellar velocity dispersion place this AGN within the scatter of the\n$M_{BH}$-$\\sigma_{*}$ relation. As NGC 6240 is a merging system, this may\nindicate that the relation is preserved during a merger at least until the\nfinal coalescence of the two nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 20:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Stellar masses, dust\ncontent, and dust-corrected SFRs are constrained using broadband SED fitting,\ngiving insights into the nature of these low-mass systems. First, a correlation\nfound between rest-frame UV luminosity and galaxy stellar mass suggests that\nmany sub-L* galaxies at z~2.3 may have approximately constant star formation\nhistories. A nearly-linear relation between stellar mass and star formation\nrate is also found, hinting that the rate at which a sub-L* BX galaxy forms its\nstars is directly related to the mass of stars that it has already formed. A\npossible explanation is that new gas that falls onto the galaxy's host halo\nalong with accreting dark matter is the source of fuel for ongoing star\nformation. The instantaneous efficiency of star formation is low in this\nscenario, of order 1%. The low-mass end of the stellar mass function is steeper\nthan expected from extrapolations of shallower surveys, resulting in a SMD at\nz~2.3 that's ~25% of the present-day value; this value is z~1.5-2x higher than\nthat given by extrapolations of shallower surveys, suggesting that the build-up\nof stellar mass in the universe has proceeded more rapidly than previously\nthought. An update to the KDF z~2 UV LF finds a steeper faint-end slope than\npreviously reported, though not as steep as that found by Reddy & Steidel\n(2009). Finally, sub-L* galaxies at z~2 carry very small amounts of dust\ncompared to their more luminous cousins, so that while only ~20% of 1700A\nphotons escape from a typical M* galaxy, more than half make it out of an M*+3\none. This paucity of dust highlights the fact that sub-L* galaxies are not\nsimple scaled copies of their more luminous cousins. It also suggests that\nsub-L* are important contributors to keeping the Universe ionized at z~2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 20:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This is achieved by an analytical formula for the\ntransition radius between stable and unstable orbits in a globular cluster. A\nstability analysis, outlined by Mardling, is used here to predict the\noccurrence of unstable stellar orbits in the outermost region of a globular\ncluster in a distant orbit around a galaxy. It is found that the eccentricity\nof the cluster-galaxy orbit has a far more significant effect on the stability\nradius of globular clusters than previous theoretical results of the tidal\nradius have found. A simple analytical formula is given for determining the\ntransition between stable and unstable orbits, which is analogous to the tidal\nradius for a globular cluster.

Among possible non-magnetic ground states, the valence bond solid (VBS)\nwith a 36-site unit cell is one of the most promising candidates. A natural\ntheoretical framework for the analysis of such VBS order is to consider quantum\nstates on a bond connecting the nearest-neighboring sites as fundamental\nquantum modes of the system and treat them as effectively independent \"bond\nparticles.\" While correctly describing the VBS order in the ground state, this\napproach, known as the bond operator theory, significantly overestimates the\nlowest spin excitation energy. To overcome this problem, we take a next logical\nstep in this paper to improve the bond operator theory and consider extended\nspin clusters as fundamental building blocks of the system. Depending on two\npossible configurations of the VBS order, various spin clusters are considered:\n(i) in the VBS order with staggered hexagonal resonance, we consider one spin\ncluster for a David star and two spin clusters with each composed of a perfect\nhexagon and three attached dimers, and (ii) in the VBS order with uniform\nhexagonal resonance, one spin cluster composed of a David star and three\nattached dimers. It is shown that the majority of low-energy spin excitations\nare nearly or perfectly flat in energy. With most of its weight coming from the\nDavid star, the lowest spin excitation has a gap much lower than the previous\nvalue obtained by the bond operator theory, narrowing the difference against\nexact diagonalization results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2011 08:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

It has been suggested that this system can be realized experimentally by\na gas of spinless fermions in an optical kagome lattice at 2/3 filling.

This renders the thermodynamics of the system\nquite exotic and interesting in this case. For both cases, J>0 and J<0, a\nfinite-temperature phase transition with a breaking of the discrete dihedral\nsymmetry group D_6 of the model is present.

By contrast, in the case J>0 the transition occurs at an\nextremely low temperature, T^>_c ~= 0.0125 J.

In particular, behavior resembling viscoelasticity has been\ntheoretically predicted for non-viscoelastic fluids.

These configurations can serve as models for prestellar\ncores before gravitational collapse.\n  Methods: A stability condition for non-isothermal spheres is derived by\nconstructing an expression for the derivative of boundary pressure with respect\nto core volume. The temperature distribution is determined by means of\nradiative transfer calculations. Based on the stability analysis, we derive the\nphysical parameters of critical cores for the mass range 0.1 - 5.0 M_sun. In\naddition, the properties of roughly Jupiter-mass cores are briefly examined.\n  Results: At the low-mass end the critical non-isothermal sphere has lower\ncentral density and a slightly larger physical radius than the corresponding\nisothermal sphere (i.e. one with the same mass and average temperature). The\ntemperature decrease towards the core centre becomes steeper towards smaller\nmasses as the central density becomes higher. The slope depends on the adopted\ndust model. We find that the critical dimensionless radius increases above the\nisothermal value xi_0 = 6.45 for very low-mass cores (< 0.2 M_sun). However, in\nthe mass-range studied here the changes are within 5% from the isothermal\nvalue.\n  Conclusions: The density structures of non-isothermal and isothermal\nBonnor-Ebert spheres for a given mass are fairly similar. However, the present\nmodels predict clear differences in the average temperatures for the same\nphysical radius. Especially for low-mass cores, the temperature gradient\nprobably has implications on the chemistry and the observed line emission. We\nalso find that hydrostatic Jupiter-mass cores with radii less than 100 AU would\nhave very high boundary pressures compared with typical pressures in the\ninterstellar space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2011 10:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

When such a system is used\na projection of the global trace, called a local trace, is observed at each\nport. This leads to the environment having reduced observational power: the set\nof local traces observed need not uniquely define the global trace that\noccurred. We consider the previously defined implementation relation\n$\\sqsubseteq_s$ and start by investigating the problem of defining a language\n${\\mathcal {\\tilde L}} (M)$ for a multi-port finite state machine (FSM) $M$\nsuch that $N \\sqsubseteq_s M$ if and only if every global trace of $N$ is in\n${\\mathcal {\\tilde L}} (M)$. The motivation is that if we can produce such a\nlanguage ${\\mathcal {\\tilde L}} (M)$ then this can potentially be used to\ninform development and testing. We show that ${\\mathcal {\\tilde L}} (M)$ can be\nuniquely defined but need not be regular. We then prove that it is generally\nundecidable whether $N \\sqsubseteq_s M$, a consequence of this result being\nthat it is undecidable whether there is a test case that is capable of\ndistinguishing two states or two multi-port FSM in distributed testing. This\nresult complements a previous result that it is undecidable whether there is a\ntest case that is guaranteed to distinguish two states or multi-port FSMs. We\nalso give some conditions under which $N \\sqsubseteq_s M$ is decidable. We then\nconsider the implementation relation $\\sqsubseteq_s^k$ that only concerns input\nsequences of length $k$ or less. Naturally, given FSMs $N$ and $M$ it is\ndecidable whether $N \\sqsubseteq_s^k M$ since only a finite set of traces is\nrelevant. We prove that if we place bounds on $k$ and the number of ports then\nwe can decide $N \\sqsubseteq_s^k M$ in polynomial time but otherwise this\nproblem is NP-hard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2011 13:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-29"}

The focus of this work is to authenticate and\nprotect the content of HDD from illegal use. The paper proposes an adaptive\nmethods for protecting a HDD based on FDE. The proposed method is labeled as\nDiskTrust. FDE encrypts entire content or a single volume on your disk.\nDiskTrust implements Symmetric key cryptography with, Advanced Encryption\nStandards. Finally, the applicability of these methodologies for HDD security\nwill be evaluated on a set of data files with different key sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2011 07:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-22"}
