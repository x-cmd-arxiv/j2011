For non-equilibrium systems, we derived a generalized\nFDT that the response function is composed of two parts: (1) a spontaneous\ncorrelation representing the relaxation which is present in the near\nequilibrium systems with detailed balance; (2) a correlation related to the\npersistence of the curl flux in steady state, which is also in part linked to a\ninternal curvature of a gauge field. The generalized FDT is also related to the\nfluctuation theorem. In the equal time limit, the generalized FDT naturally\nleads to non-equilibrium thermodynamics where the entropy production rate can\nbe decomposed into spontaneous relaxation driven by gradient force and house\nkeeping contribution driven by the non-zero flux that sustains the\nnon-equilibrium environment and breaks the detailed balance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 18:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The APEX telescope was used to observe the C17O(2-1), H13CO+(3-2),\nDCO+(3-2), N2H+(3-2), and N2D+(3-2) transitions towards the clumps. The CO\nmolecules do not appear to be significantly depleted in the observed clumps.\nThe DCO+/HCO+ and N2D+/N2H+ column density ratios are about 0.0002-0.014 and\n0.002-0.028, respectively. The former ratio is found to decrease as a function\nof gas kinetic temperature. A simple chemical analysis suggests that the lower\nlimit to the ionisation degree is in the range x(e)~10^{-8}-10^{-7}, whereas\nthe estimated upper limits range from a few 10^{-6} up to ~10^{-4}. Lower\nlimits to x(e) imply the cosmic-ray ionisation rate of H2 to lie between\nzeta_H2~10^{-17}-10^{-15} s^{-1}. These are the first estimates of x(e) and\nzeta_H2 towards massive IRDCs reported so far. The finding that CO is not\ndepleted in the observed sources conforms to the fact that they show evidence\nof star formation activity which is believed to release CO from the icy grain\nmantles back into the gas phase. The observed degree of deuteration is lower\nthan in low-mass starless cores and protostellar envelopes. Decreasing\ndeuteration with increasing temperature is likely to reflect the clump\nevolution. On the other hand, the association with young high-mass stars could\nenhance zeta_H2 and x(e) above the levels usually found in low-mass\nstar-forming regions.

The\nnumerical estimation of the cosmological parameters, $a$ and $H$ for instance,\nmakes it clear that the time evolution varies from phase to phase. As the QCD\nera turns to be fairly accessible in the high-energy experiments and the\nlattice QCD simulations, the QCD equation of state is very well defined. In\nlight of this, we introduce a systematic study of the {\\it cross-over}\nquark-hadron phase transition and an estimation for the time evolution of\nHubble parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 18:41:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2012 21:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-26"}

A correlation between size and\nlinewidth, while apparent for the largest emission structures, breaks down when\nthose structures are decomposed into smaller structures.

In particular, a plain analogy compares the wealth\nin a society with the energy in a physical system, and the trade between agents\nto the energy exchange between molecules during collisions. In physical\nsystems, the energy exchange among molecules leads to a state of equipartition\nof the energy and to an equilibrium situation where the entropy is a maximum.\nOn the other hand, in the majority of exchange models, the system converges to\na very unequal condensed state, where one or a few agents concentrate all the\nwealth of the society while the wide majority of agents shares zero or almost\nzero fraction of the wealth. So, in those economic systems a minimum entropy\nstate is attained. We propose here an analytical model where we investigate the\neffects of a particular class of economic exchanges that minimize the entropy.\nBy solving the model we discuss the conditions that can drive the system to a\nstate of minimum entropy, as well as the mechanisms to recover a kind of\nequipartition of wealth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 19:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Unlike conventional\ndensity functionals, these functionals are not invariant under unitary\ntransformations of occupied electronic states, which leave the total charge\ndensity intact, and this added complexity has greatly inhibited both their\ndevelopment and their practical applicability. Here, we first recast the\nminimization problem for non-unitary invariant energy functionals into the\nlanguage of ensemble density-functional theory, decoupling the variational\nsearch into an inner loop of unitary transformations that minimize the energy\nat fixed orbital subspace, and an outer-loop evolution of the orbitals in the\nspace orthogonal to the occupied manifold. Then, we show that the potential\nenergy surface in the inner loop is far from convex parabolic in the early\nstages of the minimization and hence minimization schemes based on these\nassumptions are unstable, and present an approach to overcome such difficulty.\nThe overall formulation allows for a stable, robust, and efficient variational\nminimization of non-unitary-invariant functionals, essential to study complex\nmaterials and molecules, and to investigate the bulk thermodynamic limit, where\norbitals converge typically to localized Wannier functions. In particular,\nusing maximally localized Wannier functions as an initial guess can greatly\nreduce the computational costs needed to reach the energy minimum while not\naffecting or improving the convergence efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 19:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-30"}

This is\nbecause the abundance of molecular hydrogen is sensitive to the abundance of\ndust, which catalyzes the formation of H_2 and helps to shield it from\ndissociating radiation. In this study we point out that in the absence of\nsignificant pre-enrichment by Population III stars forming out of zero\nmetallicity gas, such H_2-based star formation is expected to leave an imprint\nin the form of bi-modality in the metallicity distribution among dwarf galaxies\nand in the metallicity distribution of stars within individual galaxies. The\nbi-modality arises because when gas metallicity (and dust abundance) is low,\nformation of molecular gas is inefficient, the gas consumption time scale is\nlong, and star formation and metal enrichment proceed slowly. When metallicity\nreaches a critical threshold value star formation and enrichment accelerate,\nwhich leads to rapid increase in both stellar mass and metallicity of galaxies.\nWe demonstrate this process both using a simple analytical model and full\ncosmological simulations. In contrast, observed metallicity distributions of\ndwarf galaxies or stars within them are not bi-modal.

We present circuit-level schemes for extracting the error syndrome\nof these codes fault-tolerantly. We further present an integer-program-based\ndecoding algorithm for identifying the most likely error given the syndrome. We\nsimulated our syndrome extraction and decoding algorithms against three\nphysically-motivated noise models using Monte Carlo methods, and used the\nsimulations to estimate the corresponding accuracy thresholds for\nfault-tolerant quantum error correction. We also used a self-avoiding walk\nanalysis to lower-bound the accuracy threshold for two of these noise models.\nWe present and analyze two architectures for fault-tolerantly computing with\nthese codes: one with 2D arrays of qubits are stacked atop each other and one\nin a single 2D substrate. Our analysis demonstrates that color codes perform\nslightly better than Kitaev's surface codes when circuit details are ignored.\nWhen these details are considered, we estimate that color codes achieve a\nthreshold of 0.082(3)%, which is higher than the threshold of $1.3 \\times\n10^{-5}$ achieved by concatenated coding schemes restricted to nearest-neighbor\ngates in two dimensions but lower than the threshold of 0.75% to 1.1% reported\nfor the Kitaev codes subject to the same restrictions. Finally, because the\nbehavior of our decoder's performance for two of the noise models we consider\nmaps onto an order-disorder phase transition in the three-body random-bond\nIsing model in 2D and the corresponding random-plaquette gauge model in 3D, our\nresults also answer the Nishimori conjecture for these models in the negative:\nthe statistical-mechanical classical spin systems associated to the 4.8.8 color\ncodes are counterintuitively more ordered at positive temperature than at zero\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 20:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

Wang, Y.-C. Lai, J. Ren, B. Li & C. Grebogi\n[arXiv:1107.2177v1] proposed a method for the control of complex networks with\nnonlinear dynamics based on linearizing the system around a finite number of\nlocal desired states. The authors purport that any bidirectional network with\none-dimensional intrinsic node dynamics can be fully controlled by a single\ndriver node, which can be any node in the network, regardless of the network\ntopology. According to this result, a network with an arbitrarily large number\nof nodes (a million, a billion, or even more) could be controlled by a single\nnode. Here we show, however, that this result is specious and that it does not\nhold true even for networks with only two nodes. We demonstrate that the\nerroneous results are a consequence of a fundamental flaw in the proposed\nmethod, namely, that reaching a local desired state using the proposed\nlinearization procedure generally requires a nonlocal trajectory, which grossly\nviolates the linear approximation. Their further conclusion that network\nsystems with nonlinear dynamics are more controllable than those with linear\ndynamics is a known fact presented as novel based on a flawed argument. A\ncentral problem underlying the authors' argument is that their formulation is\nentirely based on the number of driver nodes required to reach a desired\nstate---even when this number is one, keeping the system at that desired state\ngenerally requires directly controlling all nodes in the network. When this is\ntaken into account, the conclusion that nonlinear dynamics can facilitate\nnetwork control was already anticipated in S.P. Cornelius, W.L. Kath & A.E.\nMotter [arXiv:1105.3726v1], which is not referenced in their paper. If one\ninsists on using the authors' formulation, then, in contradiction to their\nclaim, nonlinear systems would never be more controllable than linear ones\nbecause...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 20:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-01"}

This\ntheoretical result is complemented by a recent implementation of Newton's\nmethod that finds all roots of various polynomials of degree more than a\nmillion, significantly faster than our upper bounds on the complexity indicate,\nand often much faster than established fast root finders.

The two groups of objects\nhave distinctly different spectra: All the YSOs associated with outflows show\nevidence of massive envelopes surrounding the protostar because the spectra\nshow deep silicate absorption features and absorption by ices at 6.0, 6.8, and\n15.2 micron.

This net current is characterized by having exactly\nopposite signs in each polarities while its magnitude remains almost the same\nmost of the time. The decrease of net current in both the polarities is due to\nthe increase of current having a sign opposite to that of the net current.

However the\ncausality cannot be guaranteed for all parameters. The constraints for\nparameters are then given. We also point out that the causality and the\nstability are inter-correlated. It is found that a causal system must be\nstable, but an acausal system in the boost frame at high speed must be\nunstable. (2)The transport coefficients can be determined in kinetic theory. We\nwill firstly discuss about derivation of the shear viscosity via variational\nmethod in the Boltzmann equation. Secondly, we will compute the shear viscosity\nvia AdS/CFT duality in a Bjorken boost invariant fluid with radial flow. It is\nfound that the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density is consistent\nwith the work of Policastro, Son and Starinets. As another application of\nAdS/CFT duality, we also investigate the property of baryons in the strongly\ncoupled plasma. (3)As the last topic, we investigate the fluid dynamics with\nquantum triangle anomalies. Recently it is pointed out that the vorticity has\nto be introduced to relativistic fluid dynamics with anomalies to satisfy the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. These new terms are also relevant to the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect. We find such terms can be derived from the kinetic approach.\nThe coefficients of the vorticity are also evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 05:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

Its research has recently been\nadvanced owing to the development of methods based on sparse signal\nreconstruction. While these methods have shown advantages over conventional\nones, there are still difficulties in practical situations where true DOAs are\nnot on the discretized sampling grid. To deal with such an off-grid DOA\nestimation problem, this paper studies an off-grid model that takes into\naccount effects of the off-grid DOAs and has a smaller modeling error. An\niterative algorithm is developed based on the off-grid model from a Bayesian\nperspective while joint sparsity among different snapshots is exploited by\nassuming a Laplace prior for signals at all snapshots. The new approach applies\nto both single snapshot and multi-snapshot cases. Numerical simulations show\nthat the proposed algorithm has improved accuracy in terms of mean squared\nestimation error.

We\nfind that a population concurrently consisting of (1) dense silicate-iron\nplanets and (2) low-density gas-dominated worlds provides a natural fit to the\ncurrent data. In this scenario, the fraction of dense planets decreases with\nincreasing mass, from f_rocky = 90% at M = 1 M_Earth to f_rocky = 10% at M = 17\nM_Earth.

Our model population therefore contains four free\nparameters and is readily testable with future observations.

The proposed protocol pro-actively enforces\ntwo independent packet transmissions to interfere in a controlled and\ncooperative manner. The protocol ensures that when a node desires to transmit a\nunicast packet, regardless of the destination, it coordinates with minimal\noverhead with relay nodes in order to concurrently transmit over the wireless\nchannel with a third node. The relay is responsible for allowing packets from\nthe two selected nodes to interfere only when the desired packets can be\ndecoded at the appropriate destinations and increase the sum-rate of the\ncooperative transmission. In case this is not feasible, classic cooperative or\ndirect transmission is adopted. To enable distributed, uncoordinated, and\nadaptive operation of the protocol, a relay selection mechanism is introduced\nso that the optimal relay is selected dynamically and depending on the channel\nconditions. The most important advantage of the protocol is that interfering\ntransmissions can originate from completely independent unicast transmissions\nfrom two senders.

Several self-healing algorithms\nhave been suggested recently [IPDPS'08, PODC'08, PODC'09, PODC'11] in a line of\nwork that has yielded gradual improvements in the properties ensured on the\ngraph. This work motivates a strong general phenomenon of edge-preserving\nhealing that aims at obtaining self-healing algorithms with the constraint that\nall original edges in the graph (not deleted by the adversary), be retained in\nevery intermediate graph.\n  The previous algorithms, in their nascent form, are not explicitly edge\npreserving. In this paper, we show they can be suitably modified (We introduce\nXheal+, an edge-preserving version of Xheal[PODC'11]). Towards this end, we\npresent a general self-healing model that unifies the previous models. The main\ncontribution of this paper is not in the technical complexity, rather in the\nsimplicity with which the edge-preserving property can be ensured and the\nmessage that this is a crucial property with several benefits. In particular,\nwe highlight this by showing that, almost as an immediate corollary, subgraph\ndensities are preserved or increased. Maintaining density is a notion motivated\nby the fact that in certain distributed networks, certain nodes may require and\ninitially have a larger number of inter-connections. It is vital that a healing\nalgorithm, even amidst failures, respect these requirements. Our suggested\nmodifications yield such subgraph density preservation as a by product. In\naddition, edge preservation helps maintain any subgraph induced property that\nis monotonic. Also, algorithms that are edge-preserving require minimal\nalteration of edges which can be an expensive cost in healing - something that\nhas not been modeled in any of the past work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 09:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

These data reveal a complex spectrum in both its soft\nand hard portions. The 0.5-2 keV band is characterized by a strong\n'soft-excess' component with several emission lines, as commonly observed in\nother narrow-line AGN. Above 3 keV, a power-law fit yields a very flat slope\n(Gamma ~0.35), along with the presence of a prominent line-like emission\nfeature around ~6.4 keV. This indicates heavy obscuration along the line of\nsight to the nucleus. We find an excellent fit to the 3-10 keV continuum with a\npure reflection model, which provides strong evidence of a Compton-thick\nscreen, preventing direct detection of the intrinsic nuclear X-ray emission.\nAlthough a model consisting of a power law transmitted through an absorber with\nNh ~2.5 x 10^{23} cm^-2 also provides a reasonable fit to the hard X-ray data,\nthe equivalent width value of ~800 eV measured for the Fe Kalpha emission line\nis inconsistent with a primary continuum obscured by a Compton-thin column\ndensity. Furthermore, the ratio of 2-10 keV to de-reddened [OIII] fluxes for\nESO 138-G1 agrees with the typical values reported for well-studied\nCompton-thick Seyfert galaxies. Finally, we also note that the upper limits to\nthe 15-150 keV flux provided by Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL/IBIS seem to rule out\nthe presence of a transmitted component of the nuclear continuum even in this\nvery hard X-ray band, hence imply that the column density of the absorber could\nbe as high as 10^{25} cm^-2.

Differences in the free energies are trailed by the\ncorresponding characteristics and variations in the osmotic pressure between\nthe inside of the virus and the external bathing solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 10:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-15"}

In the first case the spheres are small (with diameter\nequivalent to 10.7 wall units) and the limit of the hydraulically smooth flow\nregime is approached. In the second case the spheres are more than three times\nlarger (49.3 wall units) and the flow is in the transitionally rough flow\nregime. Special emphasis is given on the characterisation of the force and\ntorque acting on a particle due to the turbulent flow. It is found that in both\ncases the mean drag, lift and spanwise torque are to a large extent produced at\nthe top region of the particle surface. The intensity of the particle force\nfluctuations is significantly larger in the large-sphere case, while the trend\ndiffers for the fluctuations of the individual components of the torque. A\nsimplified model is used to show that the torque fluctuations might be\nexplained by the spheres acting as a filter with respect to the size of the\nflow scales which can effectively generate torque fluctuations. Fluctuations of\nboth force and torque are found to exhibit strongly non-Gaussian probability\ndensity functions with particularly long tails, an effect which is more\npronounced in the small-sphere case. Some implications of the present results\nfor sediment erosion are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 11:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-28"}

We seek to constrain the surface composition of the Trans-Neptunian\nObject (90482) Orcus and its small satellite Vanth, as well as their mass and\ndensity. Methods. We acquired near-infrared spectra (1.4-2.4 {\\mu}m) of (90482)\nOrcus and its companion Vanth using the adaptive-optics-fed integral-field\nspectrograph SINFONI mounted on Yepun/UT4 at the European Southern Observatory\nVery Large Telescope. We took advantage of a very favorable appulse (separation\nof only 4\") between Orcus and the UCAC2 29643541 star (R = 11.6) to use the\nadaptive optics mode of SINFONI, allowing both components to be spatially\nresolved and Vanth colors to be extracted independently from Orcus. Results.\nThe spectrum of Orcus we obtain has the highest signal-to-noise ratio to date,\nand we confirm the presence of H2O ice in crystalline form, together with the\npresence of an absorption band at 2.2 {\\mu}m. We set an upper limit of about 2%\nfor the presence of methane, and 5% for ethane. Because the methane alone\ncannot account for the 2.2 {\\mu}m band, the presence of ammonia is suggested to\nthe level of a couple of percent. The colors of Vanth are found slightly redder\nthan those of Orcus, but the large measurement uncertainties forbid us from\ndrawing conclusions on the origin of the pair (capture or co-formation).\nFinally, we reset the orbital phase of Vanth around Orcus, and confirm the\norbital parameters derived by Brown et al.

The mission, which returned asteroid\nsamples to the Earth while overcoming various technical hurdles, ended on June\n13, 2010, with the planned atmospheric re-entry. In order to safely deliver the\nsample return capsule, the HAYABUSA spacecraft ended its 7-year journey in a\nbrilliant \"artificial fireball\" over the Australian desert. Spectroscopic\nobservation was carried out in the near-ultraviolet and visible wavelengths\nbetween 3000 and 7500 \\AA at 3 - 20 \\AA resolution. Approximately 100 atomic\nlines such as Fe I, Mg I, Na I, Al I, Cr I, Mn I, Ni I, Ti I, Li I, Zn I, O I,\nand N I were identified from the spacecraft. Exotic atoms such as Cu I, Mo I,\nXe I and Hg I were also detected. A strong Li I line (6708 \\AA) at a height of\n~55 km originated from the onboard Li-Ion batteries. The FeO molecule bands at\na height of ~63 km were probably formed in the wake of the spacecraft. The\neffective excitation temperature as determined from the atomic lines varied\nfrom 4500 K to 6000 K. The observed number density of Fe I was about 10 times\nmore abundant than Mg I after the spacecraft explosion. N2+(1-) bands from a\nshock layer and CN violet bands from the sample return capsule's ablating heat\nshield were dominant molecular bands in the near-ultraviolet region of 3000 -\n4000 \\AA. OH(A-X) band was likely to exist around 3092 \\AA. A strong shock\nlayer from the HAYABUSA spacecraft was rapidly formed at heights between 93 km\nand 83 km, which was confirmed by detection of N2+(1-) bands with a vibration\ntemperature of ~13000 K. Gray-body temperature of the capsule at a height of\n~42 km was estimated to be ~2437 K which is matched to a theoretical\nprediction. The final message of the HAYABUSA spacecraft and its sample return\ncapsule are discussed through our spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 15:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In particular, the\ncontribution of the ghost-loops is automatically transverse, by virtue of the\nQED-like Ward identities satisfied in this framework. Using as nonperturbative\ninput the available lattice data for the ghost dressing function, we show that\nthe ghost contributions have a rather sizable effect on the overall shape of\nthe gluon propagator, both for $d=3,4$.

The most important\nissue is the construction, from the wave function, of a probability\ndistribution answering various questions of physical interest, such as the\nprobability of the system entering a given region of configuration space at any\nstage in its entire history. A standard but heuristic procedure is to use the\nflux of (components of) the wave function in a WKB approximation as the\nprobability. This gives sensible semiclassical results but lacks an underlying\noperator formalism. Here, we supply the underlying formalism by deriving\nprobability distributions linked to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation using the\ndecoherent histories approach to quantum theory, building on the generalized\nquantum mechanics formalism developed by Hartle. The key step is the\nconstruction of class operators characterizing questions of physical interest.\nTaking advantage of a recent decoherent histories analysis of the arrival time\nproblem in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we show that the appropriate\nclass operators in quantum cosmology are readily constructed using a complex\npotential. The class operator for not entering a region of configuration space\nis given by the $S$-matrix for scattering off a complex potential localized in\nthat region. We thus derive the class operators for entering one or more\nregions in configuration space. The class operators commute with the\nHamiltonian, have a sensible classical limit and are closely related to an\nintersection number operator. The corresponding probabilities coincide, in a\nsemiclassical approximation, with standard heuristic procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 15:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
