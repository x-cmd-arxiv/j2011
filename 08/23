As pointed out by Lyne et al., the presence of these pulsars cannot\nbe explained by core-collapse supernovae, as is commonly assumed for their\ncounterparts in the Galactic disk. We apply a Bayesian analysis to the results\nfrom surveys for radio pulsars in globular clusters and find the number of\npotentially observable non-recycled radio pulsars present in all clusters to be\n< 3600. Accounting for beaming and retention considerations, the implied birth\nrate for any formation scenario for all 97 clusters is < 0.25 pulsars per\ncentury assuming a Maxwellian distribution of velocities with a dispersion of\n10 km s^{-1}. The implied birth rates for higher velocity dispersions are\nsubstantially higher than inferred for such pulsars in the Galactic disk. This\nsuggests that the velocity dispersion of young pulsars in globular clusters is\nsignificantly lower than those of disk pulsars. These numbers may be\nsubstantial overestimates due to the fact that the currently known sample of\nyoung pulsars is observed only in metal-rich clusters. We propose that young\npulsars may only be formed in globular clusters with metallicities with\nlog[Fe/H] > -0.6.

The unabsorbed luminosities ranged from\n1.9x10^40 to 1.25x10^42 erg/s. We confirm here the detection of spectral state\ntransitions from HLX-1 reminiscent of Galactic black hole binaries: at high\nluminosities, the X-ray spectrum showed a thermal state dominated by a disk\ncomponent with temperatures of 0.26 keV at most, and at low luminosities the\nspectrum is dominated by a hard power law with a photon index in the range\n1.4-2.1, consistent with a hard state. The source was also observed in a steep\npower law state. In the thermal state, the luminosity of the disk component\nappears to scale with the fourth power of the inner disk temperature which\nsupports the presence of an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk.\nThe low fractional variability (rms of 9+/-9%) in this state also suggests the\npresence of a dominant disk. The spectral changes and long-term variability of\nthe source cannot be explained by variations of the beaming angle and are not\nconsistent with the source being in a super-Eddington accretion state. HLX-1 is\nthus an unusual ULX as it is similar to Galactic black hole binaries, which\nhave non-beamed and sub-Eddington emission, but with luminosities 3 orders of\nmagnitude higher. In this picture, a lower limit on the mass of the black hole\nof >9000 M_sun can be derived, and the disk temperature in the thermal state\nalso suggests the presence of a black hole of a few 10^3 M_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 19:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The fraction of TD-producing mergers where both parents are\nearly-type galaxies is <2%, suggesting that TDs are unlikely to form in such\nmergers. The bulk of TD-producing systems inhabit a field environment and have\nmass ratios greater than 1:7 (the median value is 1:2.5). TDs forming at the\ntidal-tail tips are ~4 times more massive than those forming at the base of the\ntails. TDs have stellar masses that are less than 10% of the stellar masses of\ntheir parents and typically lie within 15 optical half-light radii of their\nparent galaxies. The TD population is typically bluer than the parents, with a\nmedian offset of ~0.3 mag in the (g-r) colour and the TD colours are not\naffected by the presence of AGN activity in their parents. An analysis of their\nstar formation histories indicates that TDs contain both newly formed stars\n(with a median age of ~30 Myr) and old stars drawn from the parent disks, each\ncomponent probably contributing roughly equally to their stellar mass. Thus,\nTDs are not formed purely through gas condensation in tidal tails but host a\nsignificant component of old stars from the parent disks. Finally, an analysis\nof the TD contribution to the local dwarf-to-massive galaxy ratio indicates\nthat ~6% of dwarfs in nearby clusters may have a tidal origin, if TD production\nrates in nearby mergers are representative of those in the high-redshift\nUniverse. Even if TD production rates at high redshift were several factors\nhigher, it seems unlikely that the entire dwarf galaxy population today is a\nresult of merger activity over the lifetime of the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The subsequent\ncollapse of this gas on a dynamical timescale can provide an abundant source of\nfuel for AGN heating and star formation. Thus, this mechanism provides a way to\nlink the AGN accretion rate to the global properties of an ambient cooling\nflow, but without the implicit assumption that the accreted material must have\nflowed onto the black hole from 10s of kiloparsecs away. It is shown that a\nfuelling mechanism of this sort naturally leads to a close balance between AGN\nheating and the radiative cooling rate of the hot, X-ray emitting halo.\nFurthermore, AGN powered by cooling-induced gravitational instability would\nexhibit characteristic duty cycles (delta) which are redolent of recent\nobservational findings: delta is proportional to L_X/sigma_{*}^{3}, where L_X\nis the X-ray luminosity of the hot atmosphere, and sigma_{*} is the central\nstellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy.

In relaxed\nclusters with cool cores, these edges have been interpreted as evidence for the\n\"sloshing\" of the core gas in the cluster's gravitational potential. The\nsmoothness of these edges has been interpreted as evidence for the stabilizing\neffect of magnetic fields \"draped\" around the front surfaces. To check this\nhypothesis, we perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulations of\nmagnetized gas sloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by encounters with\nsubclusters. We go beyond previous works on the simulation of cold fronts in a\nmagnetized intracluster medium by simulating their formation in realistic,\nidealized mergers with high resolution ({\\Delta}x ~ 2 kpc). Our simulations\nsample a parameter space of plausible initial magnetic field strengths and\nfield configurations. In the simulations, we observe strong velocity shears\nassociated with the cold fronts amplifying the magnetic field along the cold\nfront surfaces, increasing the magnetic field strength in these layers by up to\nan order of magnitude, and boosting the magnetic pressure up to\nnear-equipartition with thermal pressure in some cases. In these layers, the\nmagnetic field becomes strong enough to stabilize the cold fronts against\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, resulting in sharp, smooth fronts as those seen\nin observations of real clusters. These magnetic fields also result in strong\nsuppression of mixing of high and low-entropy gas in the cluster, seen in our\nsimulations of mergers in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, the\nheating of the core due to sloshing is very modest and is unable to stave off a\ncooling catastrophe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 20:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 23:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

However, under some circumstances, such as off-center ignition, the\ncomposition profile resulting from nuclear burning can be destabilizing, and\ncharacterized by an outwardly increasing mean molecular weight. The potential\nfor instabilities under these circumstances, and the consequences that they may\nhave on stellar structural evolution, remain largely unexplored. In this paper\nwe study the development and evolution of instabilities associated with\nunstable composition gradients in regions which are initially stable according\nto linear Schwarzschild and Ledoux criteria. In particular, we explore the\nmixing taking place under various conditions with multi-dimensional\nhydrodynamic convection models based on stellar evolutionary calculations of\nthe core helium flash in a 1.25 \\Msun star, the core carbon flash in a\n9.3\\,\\Msun star, and of oxygen shell burning in a star with a mass of\n23\\,\\Msun.

The\nobserved abundance patterns are most likely due to one or more of the following\nprocesses: continuing enrichment by winds of a stellar population pre-enriched\nby SNCC products; intermittent formation of massive stars in the central\ncooling core; early enrichment of the low entropy gas. We also discuss other\nprocesses that might have contributed to the observed radial profiles, such as\na stellar initial mass function that changes with radius; changes in the\npre-enrichment of core-collapse supernova progenitors; and a diversity in the\nelemental yields of SN Ia. Although systematic uncertainties prevent us from\nmeasuring the O abundance robustly, indications are that it is about 2 times\nlower than predicted by the enrichment models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 20:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

A very fine numerical technique\n(Liao, 2009) with negligible truncation and round-off errors, called here the\n\"clean numerical simulation\" (CNS), is applied to investigate the propagation\nof the micro-level unavoidable uncertain fluctuation (caused by the\ncontinuum-assumption of fluid) of initial conditions for Lorenz equation with\nchaotic solutions. Our statistic analysis based on CNS computation of 10,000\nsamples shows that, due to the SDIC, the uncertainty of the micro-level\nstatistic fluctuation of initial conditions transfers into the macroscopic\nrandomness of chaos. This suggests that chaos might be a bridge from\nmicro-level uncertainty to macroscopic randomness, and thus would be an origin\nof macroscopic randomness. We reveal in this article that, due to the SDIC of\nchaos and the inherent uncertainty of initial data, accurate long-term\nprediction of chaotic solution is not only impossible in mathematics but also\nhas no physical meanings.

Under a given requirement\non the rate outage probability for receivers, we aim to maximize the system\nutility (e.g., the weighted sum rate, weighted geometric mean rate, and the\nweighed harmonic mean rate) subject to the rate outage constraints and\nindividual power constraints. The outage constraints, however, lead to a\ncomplicated, nonconvex structure for the considered beamforming design problem\nand make the optimization problem difficult to handle. {Although} this\nnonconvex optimization problem can be solved in an exhaustive search manner,\nthis brute-force approach is only feasible when the number of\ntransmitter-receiver pairs is small. For a system with a large number of\ntransmitter-receiver pairs, computationally efficient alternatives are\nnecessary. The focus of this paper is hence on the design of such efficient\napproximation methods. In particular, by employing semidefinite relaxation\n(SDR) and first-order approximation techniques, we propose an efficient\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality\napproximate beamforming solutions via solving a sequence of convex\napproximation problems. The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a\nstationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming\ndesign problem. {Furthermore}, we propose a distributed SCA algorithm where\neach transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using local CDI and information\nobtained from limited message exchange with the other transmitters. Our\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its\ndistributed counterpart indeed converge, and near-optimal performance can be\nachieved for all the considered system utilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 01:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 00:40:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 07:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 07:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The algorithm can be used to\nestimate the error floor of LDPC codes or to be part of the apparatus to design\nLDPC codes with low error floors. For regular codes, the algorithm is initiated\nwith a set of short cycles as the input. For irregular codes, in addition to\nshort cycles, variable nodes with low degree and cycles with low approximate\ncycle extrinsic message degree (ACE) are also used as the initial inputs. The\ninitial inputs are then expanded recursively to dominant trapping sets of\nincreasing size. At the core of the algorithm lies the analysis of the\ngraphical structure of dominant trapping sets and the relationship of such\nstructures to short cycles, low-degree variable nodes and cycles with low ACE.\nThe algorithm is universal in the sense that it can be used for an arbitrary\ngraph and that it can be tailored to find other graphical objects, such as\nabsorbing sets and Zyablov-Pinsker (ZP) trapping sets, known to dominate the\nperformance of LDPC codes in the error floor region over different channels and\nfor different iterative decoding algorithms.

Thus, a latitude\ndependence of the solar spectrum, even with the heliocentric angle constant,\ncould lead to effects of the type observed.\n  Aim: We explore a possible variation in the strength of certain spectral\nlines, used in the comparisons between the composition of the Sun and the\ntwins, at loci on the solar disk with different latitudes but at constant\nheliocentric angle.\n  Methods: We use the TRIPPEL spectrograph at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope\non La Palma to record spectra in five spectral regions in order to compare\ndifferent locations on the solar disk at a heliocentric angle of 45 deg.\nEquivalent widths and other parameters are measured for fifteen different lines\nrepresenting nine atomic species.\n  Results: The relative variations in equivalent widths at the equator and at\nsolar latitude 45 deg are found to be less than 1.5 % for all spectral lines\nstudied.

The question of how the performance of a\npopulation-based EA depends on the population size arises naturally. The\nperformance of an EA may be evaluated by different measures, such as the\naverage convergence rate to the optimal set per generation or the expected\nnumber of generations to encounter an optimal solution for the first time.\nPopulation scalability is the performance ratio between a benchmark EA and\nanother EA using identical genetic operators but a larger population size.\nAlthough intuitively the performance of an EA may improve if its population\nsize increases, currently there exist only a few case studies for simple\nfitness functions. This paper aims at providing a general study for discrete\noptimisation. A novel approach is introduced to analyse population scalability\nusing the fundamental matrix. The following two contributions summarize the\nmajor results of the current article. (1) We demonstrate rigorously that for\nelitist EAs with identical global mutation, using a lager population size\nalways increases the average rate of convergence to the optimal set; and yet,\nsometimes, the expected number of generations needed to find an optimal\nsolution (measured by either the maximal value or the average value) may\nincrease, rather than decrease. (2) We establish sufficient and/or necessary\nconditions for the superlinear scalability, that is, when the average\nconvergence rate of a $(\\mu+\\mu)$ EA (where $\\mu\\ge2$) is bigger than $\\mu$\ntimes that of a $(1+1)$ EA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 09:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 08:54:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 19:02:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 10:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-13"}

The theory starts from the\ncomplete electron nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics and I identify\nthe operator for the nonequilibrium Gibbs free energy. I demonstrate a minimal\nproperty of a functional for the nonequilibrium thermodynamic grand potential\nwhich thus uniquely identifies the solution as the exact nonequilibrium density\nmatrix.

Our aim\nis to obtain follow-up spectropolarimetry to search for a magnetic field in\nmagnetic candidate stars. We quantify UV wind line variability, and analyse its\ntime behaviour. The B1/B2V star sigma Lup emerged as a new magnetic candidate\nstar. AAT spectropolarimetric measurements with SEMPOL were obtained.\n  The stellar wind line variations of sigma Lup are similar to what is known in\nmagnetic B stars, but no periodicity could be determined. We detected a\nlongitudinal magnetic field with varying strength and amplitude of about 100 G\nwith error bars of typically 20 G, which supports an oblique magnetic-rotator\nconfiguration. The equivalent width variations of the UV lines, the magnetic\nand the optical line variations are consistent with the well-known photometric\nperiod of 3.02 days, which we identify with the rotation period of the star.\nAdditional observations with ESPaDOnS at CFHT strongly confirmed this\ndiscovery, and allowed to determine a precise magnetic period. Further analysis\nrevealed that $\\sigma$ Lupi is a helium-strong star, with an enhanced nitrogen\nabundance and an underabundance of carbon, and has a spotted surface.\n  We conclude that sigma Lup is a magnetic oblique rotator, and is a He-strong\nstar. It is the 4th B star for which a magnetic field is discovered from\nstudying only its wind variability. Like in the other magnetic B stars the wind\nemission originates in the magnetic equator, with maximum emission occurring\nwhen a magnetic pole points towards the Earth. The 3.02 d magnetic rotation\nperiod is consistent with the photometric period, with maximum light\ncorresponding to maximum magnetic field.

We use the DustEM code from Compiegne et al. to describe\nthe extinction and IR emission of all dust populations. The spinning dust\nemission is obtained with SpDust, as described by Silsbee et al., that we have\ncoupled to DustEM. We carry out full radiative transfer simulations and\ncarefully estimate the local gas state as a function of position within\ninterstellar clouds. We show that the spinning dust emission is sensitive to\nthe abundances of the major ions and we propose a simple scheme to estimate\nthese abundances. We also investigate the effect of changing the cosmic-ray\nrate. In dense media, where radiative transfer is mandatory, we show that the\nrelationship between the spinning and mid-IR emissivities of PAHs is no longer\nlinear and that the spinning dust emission may actually be strong at the centre\nof clouds where the mid-IR PAH emission is weak. These results provide new ways\nto trace grain growth from diffuse to dense medium and will be useful for the\nanalysis of AME at the scale of interstellar clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 12:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 07:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Core-collapse\nsimulators find it challenging to generate an explosion from the collapse of\nthe core of massive stars. It is believed that a better understanding of the\nmicrophysics of core-collapse can lead to successful results. The weak\ninteraction processes are able to trigger the collapse and control the\nlepton-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{e}$) of the core material. It is suggested that the\ntemporal variation of $Y_{e}$ within the core of a massive star has a pivotal\nrole to play in the stellar evolution and a fine-tuning of this parameter at\nvarious stages of presupernova evolution is the key to generate an explosion.\nDuring the presupernova evolution of massive stars, isotopes of iron, mainly\n$^{54,55,56}$Fe, are considered to be key players in controlling $Y_{e}$ ratio\nvia electron capture on these nuclide. Recently an improved microscopic\ncalculation of weak interaction mediated rates for iron isotopes was introduced\nusing the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA)\ntheory. The pn-QRPA theory allows a microscopic \\textit{state-by-state}\ncalculation of stellar capture rates which greatly increases the reliability of\ncalculated rates. The results were suggestive of some fine-tuning of the\n$Y_{e}$ ratio during various phases of stellar evolution.

This was thought to be related to observational biases, but recent\nhigh-precision measurements of WD masses in a great number of CVs are\nchallenging this interpretation. We review the measured WD masses of CVs,\ndetermine the WD-mass distribution of an extensive sample of\npost-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) that are representative for the\nprogenitors of the current CV population (pre-CVs) and compare both\ndistributions. We calculate the CV formation time of the PCEBs in our sample by\ndetermining the post common-envelope (CE) and the main-sequence evolution of\nthe binary systems and define a pre-CV to be a PCEB that evolves into a\nsemi-detached configuration with stable mass transfer within less than the age\nof the Galaxy. Possible observational biases affecting the WD-mass distribution\nfor the pre-CV and the CV samples are discussed. The mean WD mass among CVs is\n<Mwd>=0.83\\pm0.23 Msun, much larger than that found for pre-CVs,\n<Mwd>=0.67\\pm0.21 Msun. Selection effects cannot explain the high WD masses\nobserved in CVs and we here suggest two possible explanations, both of which\nimply substantial revisions to the standard model of CV evolution: either most\nCVs have formed above the orbital-period gap (which requires a high WD mass to\ninitiate stable mass transfer or a previous phase of thermal-timescale mass\ntransfer), or the mass of the WDs in CVs grows through accretion (which\nstrongly disagrees with the predictions of classical nova models). Both options\nmay imply that CVs contribute to the single-degenerate progenitors of Type Ia\nsupernovae. The number of He-core WDs found in CVs (<=10%) is roughly\nconsistent with the number of He-core WDs in pre-CVs (<=17+-8%), which\nindicates a low value of the CE efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 13:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-24"}

However, these results are\nbased on assumptions of the shape and extension of the GRG lobe electron\nspectrum. We re-examine the energetics of GRG lobes as derived by inverse\nCompton scattering of CMB photons (ICS-CMB) by relativistic electrons in RG\nlobes to assess the physical conditions of RG lobes, their energetics and their\nradiation regime. We consider the GRG DA 240 recently observed by Suzaku as a\nreference case and we also discuss other RG lobes observed with Chandra and\nXMM. We model the spectral energy distribution of the DA 240 East lobe to get\nconstraint on the shape and the extension of the electron spectrum in the lobe\nby using multi-frequency information from radio to gamma-rays. We use radio and\nX-ray data to constrain the shape and normalization of the electron spectrum\nand we then calculate the SZ effect expected in GRG lobes that is sensitive to\nthe total electron energy density. We show that the electron energy density U_e\nderived form X-ray observations yields only a rough lower limit to its actual\nvalue and that most of the estimates of U_e based on X-ray measurements have to\nbe increased even by a large factor by considering realistic estimates of the\nlower electron momentum p_1. This brings RG lobes away from the equipartition\ncondition towards a particle-dominated and Compton power dominance regime. We\nuse the distribution of RG lobes in the U_e/U_B vs. U_e/U_CMB plane as a\nfurther divide between different physical regimes of particle and field\ndominance, and radiation mechanism dominance in RG lobes. We conclude that the\nSZ effect produced by ICS-CMB mechanism observable in RG lobes provides\nreliable estimate of p_1 and U_e and is the best tool to determine the total\nenergy density of RG lobes and to assess their physical regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 13:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The critical inclination can maintain minimal deviations of\neccentricity and argument of pericentre from the initial values, and orbits at\nthis inclination have been applied to some space missions. Most previous\nresearches about the critical inclination were made under the assumption that\nthe oblateness term J2 is dominant among the harmonic coefficients. This paper\ninvestigates the extension of the critical inclination where the concept of the\ncritical inclination is different from that of the traditional sense. First,\nthe study takes the case of Venus for instance, and provides some preliminary\nresults. Then for general cases, given the values of argument of pericentre and\neccentricity, the relationship between the multiplicity of the solutions for\nthe critical inclination and the values of J2 and J4 is analyzed. Besides, when\ngiven certain values of J2 and J4, the relationship between the multiplicity of\nthe solutions for the critical inclination and the values of semimajor axis and\neccentricity is studied. The results show that for some cases, the value of the\ncritical inclination is far away from that of the traditional sense or even has\nmultiple solutions.

This results in reduced centrifugal suppression on the\ncross sections and increased inelastic cross sections at low energy and low\nfield. We also analyze state-to-state cross sections, for various initial\nstates, and show that hyperfine interactions introduce additional mechanisms\nfor spin relaxation. In particular, there are hyperfine-mediated collisions to\noutgoing channels that are not centrifugally suppressed. However, for Mg+NH\nthese unsuppressed channels make only small contributions to the total cross\nsections.

A paradigmatic example is the topological\nphase transition of the vortex dynamics in superfluid films and layered\nsuperconductors which are described by SG type models. Periodic scalar\npotentials find applications in $d=4$ dimensions, too. Higgs, inflaton and\naxion physics are examples where scalar fields naturally appear, thus, the SG\nmodel can be used instead of the usual polynomial one. The SG quantum field\ntheory can be mapped onto the neutral Coulomb-gas (CG) in arbitrary dimension\nand the renormalization group (RG) study of the d-dimensional CG model was\nobtained in the dilute gas approximation. It signals a single phase for $d>2$,\nhowever, it was shown recently, that a suitable generalization of the SG model\ncan posses a topological phase transitions in $d=4$ dimensions.
