The cooling\nrates of this scenario account for medium-modified one-pion exchange in dense\nmatter and polarization effects in the pair-breaking formations of superfluid\nneutrons and protons. Crucial for the successful description of the observed\ndata is a substantial reduction of the thermal conductivity, resulting from a\nsuppression of both the electron and nucleon contributions to it by medium\neffects. We also find that possibly in as little as about ten years of\ncontinued observation, the data may tell whether or not fast cooling processes\nare active in this neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2011 16:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-20"}

A seller has\n$k$ identical items for sale and is facing $n$ potential buyers (\"agents\") that\nare arriving sequentially. Each agent is interested in buying one item. Each\nagent's value for an item is an IID sample from some fixed distribution with\nsupport $[0,1]$. The seller offers a take-it-or-leave-it price to each arriving\nagent (possibly different for different agents), and aims to maximize his\nexpected revenue.\n  We focus on \"prior-independent\" mechanisms -- ones that do not use any\ninformation about the distribution. They are desirable because knowing the\ndistribution is unrealistic in many practical scenarios. We study how the\nrevenue of such mechanisms compares to the revenue of the optimal offline\nmechanism that knows the distribution (\"offline benchmark\").\n  We present a prior-independent dynamic pricing mechanism whose revenue is at\nmost $O((k \\log n)^{2/3})$ less than the offline benchmark, for every\ndistribution that is regular. In fact, this guarantee holds without *any*\nassumptions if the benchmark is relaxed to fixed-price mechanisms. Further, we\nprove a matching lower bound. The performance guarantee for the same mechanism\ncan be improved to $O(\\sqrt{k} \\log n)$, with a distribution-dependent\nconstant, if $k/n$ is sufficiently small. We show that, in the worst case over\nall demand distributions, this is essentially the best rate that can be\nobtained with a distribution-specific constant.\n  On a technical level, we exploit the connection to multi-armed bandits (MAB).\nWhile dynamic pricing with unlimited supply can easily be seen as an MAB\nproblem, the intuition behind MAB approaches breaks when applied to the setting\nwith limited supply.

We observe a solar jet at north polar coronal hole (NPCH) using SDO\nAIA 304 {\\deg}A image data on 3 August 2010. The jet rises obliquely above the\nsolar limb and then retraces its propagation path to fall back. Aims. We\nnumerically model this observed solar jet by implementing a realistic (VAL-C)\nmodel of solar temperature. Methods. We solve two-dimensional ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations numerically to simulate the observed solar jet.\nWe consider a localized velocity pulse that is essentially parallel to the\nbackground magnetic field lines and initially launched at the top of the solar\nphotosphere. The pulse steepens into a shock at higher altitudes, which\ntriggers plasma perturbations that exhibit the observed features of the jet.\nThe typical direction of the pulse also clearly exhibits the leading front of\nthe moving jet. Results. Our numerical simulations reveal that a large\namplitude initial velocity pulse launched at the top of the solar photosphere\nproduces in general the observed properties of the jet, e.g., upward and\nbackward average velocities, height, width, life-time, and ballistic nature.\nConclusions. The close matching between the jet observations and numerical\nsimulations provides first strong evidence for the formation of this jet by a\nsingle velocity pulse. The strong velocity pulse is most likely generated by\nthe low- atmospheric reconnection in the polar region which results in\ntriggering of the jet. The downflowing material of the jet most likely vanishes\nin the next upcoming velocity pulses from lower solar atmosphere, and therefore\ndistinctly launched a single jet upward in the solar atmosphere is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2011 23:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The question that arises is whether or not the deployment of memory\ncan result in a fundamental improvement in the performance of the network. In\nthis paper, we answer this question affirmatively by first establishing the\nfundamental gains of memory-assisted source compression and then applying the\ntechnique to a network. Specifically, we investigate the gain of\nmemory-assisted compression in random network graphs consisted of a single\nsource and several randomly selected memory units.

A classic theorem of Hajnal and Szemer\\'edi\nstates that if $G$ is a graph of order $n$ with minimum degree $\\delta(G) \\ge\n(t-1)n/t$ and $t| n$, then $G$ contains a perfect $K_t$-matching. Let $G$ be a\n$t$-partite graph with vertex classes $V_1$,..., $V_t$ each of size $n$. We\nshow that if every vertex $x \\in V_i$ is joined to at least $((t-1)/t +\n\\gamma)n $ vertices of $V_j$ for $i \\ne j$, then $G$ contains a perfect\n$K_t$-matching, thus verifying a conjecture of Fisher asymptotically.\nFurthermore, we consider a generalisation to hypergraphs in terms of the\ncodegree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2011 14:35:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2012 13:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

The combined interaction potential becomes tunable by\nvariation of wavelength, polarization and intensity of the optical field and\nits dependence on the intermolecular separation exhibits a crossover from an\ninverse-power to an oscillating behavior. The ability thereby offered to\ncontrol molecular interactions opens up avenues toward the creation and\nmanipulation of novel phases of ultracold polar gases among whose\ncharacteristics is a long-range entanglement of the dipoles' mutual\norientation. We devised an accurate analytic model of such\noptical-field-dressed dipole-dipole interaction potentials, which enables a\nstraightforward access to the optical-field parameters required for the design\nof intermolecular interactions in the laboratory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2011 16:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We trapped even higher spontaneous movement speeds (up to\n125 m/s) in virtual experiments for drops on nanoscale cones by using molecular\ndynamics simulations. The underlying mechanism is found to be universally\neffective - drops on any surface either hydrophilic or hydrophobic with varying\nmean curvature are subject to driving forces toward the gradient direction of\nthe mean curvature. The larger the mean curvature of the surface and the lower\nthe contact angle of the liquid are, the stronger the driving force will be.\nThis discovery can lead to more effective techniques for transporting droplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2011 17:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-24"}
