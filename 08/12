Such collisions are used to produce super-strong electric fields by the\nhuge number of interacting protons to test spontaneous positron-electron pair\nemission (vacuum decay) predicted by the quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory.\nMulti-nucleon transfer in actinide collisions could also be used as an\nalternative way to fusion in order to produce neutron-rich heavy and superheavy\nelements thanks to inverse quasifission mechanisms. Actinide collisions are\nstudied in a dynamical quantum microscopic approach. The three-dimensional\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) code {\\textsc{tdhf3d}} is used with a full\nSkyrme energy density functional to investigate the time evolution of\nexpectation values of one-body operators, such as fragment position and\nparticle number. This code is also used to compute the dispersion of the\nparticle numbers (e.g., widths of fragment mass and charge distributions) from\nTDHF transfer probabilities, on the one hand, and using the Balian-Veneroni\nvariational principle, on the other hand. A first application to test QED is\ndiscussed. Collision times in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U are computed to determine the\noptimum energy for the observation of the vacuum decay. It is shown that the\ninitial orientation strongly affects the collision times and reaction\nmechanism. The highest collision times predicted by TDHF in this reaction are\nof the order of $\\sim4$ zs at a center of mass energy of 1200 MeV. According to\nmodern calculations based on the Dirac equation, the collision times at\n$E_{cm}>1$ GeV are sufficient to allow spontaneous electron-positron pair\nemission from QED vacuum decay, in case of bare uranium ion collision. A second\napplication of actinide collisions to produce neutron-rich transfermiums is\ndiscussed. A new inverse quasifission mechanism associated to a specific\norientation of the nuclei is proposed to produce transfermium nuclei ($Z>100$)\nin the collision of prolate deformed actinides such as $^{232}$Th+$^{250}$Cf.\nThe collision of the tip of one nucleus with the side of the other results in a\nnucleon flux toward the latter. The probability distributions for transfermium\nproduction in such a collision are computed. The produced nuclei are more\nneutron-rich than those formed in fusion reactions, thus, leading to more\nstable isotopes closer to the predicted superheavy island of stability. In\naddition to mass and charge dispersion, the Balian-Veneroni variational\nprinciple is used to compute correlations between $Z$ and $N$ distributions,\nwhich are zero in standard TDHF calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2011 16:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

The study of abundances in the nucleus of active galaxies allows us\nto investigate the evolution of abundance by comparing local and higher\nredshift galaxies.

We address this problem by calibrating three\nmerger rate estimators with a suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations and\nthree galaxy formation models. We estimate T_obs(z) for (1) close galaxy pairs\nwith a range of projected separations, (2) the morphology indicator G-M20, and\n(3) the morphology indicator asymmetry A.

The remaining differences between the galaxy merger\nrates are explained by the differences in the range of mass-ratio measured by\ndifferent techniques and differing parent galaxy selection.

Our intensive X-ray monitoring of\nthis object affords the opportunity to investigate whether and how the intense\nX-ray emission is related to pre-MS accretion activity. Our analysis of all\nfourteen Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of V1647 Ori demonstrate that\nvariations in the X-ray luminosity of V1647 Ori are correlated with similar\nchanges in the OIR brightness of this source during both (2003-2005 and 2008)\neruptions, strongly supporting the hypothesis that accretion is the primary\ngeneration mechanism for the X-ray outbursts. Furthermore, the Chandra\nmonitoring demonstrates that the X-ray spectral properties of the second\neruption were strikingly similar to those of the 2003 eruption. We find that\nX-ray spectra obtained immediately following the second outburst - during which\nV1647 Ori exhibited high X-ray luminosities, high hardness ratios, and strong\nX-ray variability - are well modeled as a heavily absorbed (N_H ~ 4x10^22\ncm^-2), single-component plasma with characteristic temperatures (kT_X ~ 2-6\nkeV) that are consistently too high to be generated via accretion shocks but\nare in the range expected for plasma heated by magnetic reconnection events.

Since the OIR and X-ray changes are\ncorrelated, we hypothesize that these reconnection events either occur in the\naccretion stream connecting the circumstellar disk to the star or in\naccretion-enhanced protostellar coronal activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2011 23:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-09"}

Fluxes in the bulk stabilize all\nmoduli except the `breathing' modulus (that is generically present in\nhigher-dimensional supergravities). Back-reaction to the inflaton roll causes\nthe 4D Einstein-frame on-brane geometry to expand, a(t) ~ t^p, as well as\nexciting the breathing mode and causing the two off-brane dimensions to expand,\nr(t) ~ t^q. The model evades the general no-go theorems precluding 4D de Sitter\nsolutions, since adjustments to the brane-localized inflaton potential allow\nthe power p to be dialed to be arbitrarily large, with the 4D geometry becoming\nde Sitter in the limit p -> infinity (in which case q = 0).

In this study, we use these\nTRACE observations to corroborate previous theoretical work, as well as\nestimate the magnetic field strength and the degree of longitudinal\ninhomogeneity. Methods: Loop edges are tracked, both spatially and temporally,\nusing wavelet modulus maxima algorithms, with corresponding loop displacements\nfrom its quiescent state analysed by fitting scaled sinusoidal functions. The\nphysical parameters of the coronal loop are subsequently determined using\nseismological techniques. RESULTS: The studied coronal loop is found to\noscillate with two distinct periods, 501 +/- 5 s and 274 +/- 7 s, which could\nbe interpreted as belonging to the fundamental and first harmonic, or could\nreflect the stage of an overdriven loop. When assuming the periods belong to\nthe fundamental kink mode and its first harmonic, we obtain a magnetic field\nstrength inside the oscillating coronal loop as 2.0 +/- 0.7 G. In contrast,\ninterpreting the oscillations as a combination of the loop's natural kink\nfrequency and a harmonious EIT wave provides a magnetic field strength of 5.8\n+/- 1.5 G. Using the ratio of the two periods, we find that the gravitational\nscale height in the loop is 73 +/- 3 Mm. Conclusions: We show that the\nobservation of two distinct periods in a coronal loop does not necessarily lead\nto a unique conclusion. Multiple plausible scenarios exist, suggesting that\nboth the derived strength of the magnetic field and the sub-resolution\nproperties of the coronal loop depend entirely on which interpretation is\nchosen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 09:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This effect has been\nparticularly observed in intermittently connected networks like DTN (Delay\nTolerant Networks). Given that common social intentions generate similar human\nbehavior, it is relevant to exploit this knowledge in the network protocols\ndesign, e.g. to identify the closeness degree between two nodes. In this paper,\nwe propose a temporal link prediction technique for DTN which quantifies the\nbehavior similarity between each pair of nodes and makes use of it to predict\nfuture links. Our prediction method keeps track of the spatio-temporal aspects\nof nodes behaviors organized as a third-order tensor that aims to records the\nevolution of the network topology. After collapsing the tensor information, we\ncompute the degree of similarity for each pair of nodes using the Katz measure.\nThis metric gives us an indication on the link occurrence between two nodes\nrelying on their closeness. We show the efficiency of this method by applying\nit on three mobility traces: two real traces and one synthetic trace. Through\nseveral simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique\nregarding another approach based on a similarity metric used in DTN. The\nvalidity of this method is proven when the computation of score is made in a\ndistributed way (i.e. with local information). We attest that the tensor-based\ntechnique is effective for temporal link prediction applied to the\nintermittently connected networks. Furthermore, we think that this technique\ncan go beyond the realm of DTN and we believe this can be further applied on\nevery case of figure in which there is a need to derive the underlying social\nstructure of a network of mobile users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 11:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Its high energy emission shows\nvariability, a harder continuum with respect to the radio quiet AGN population,\nand weak reflection features. Suzaku found the source in a minimum flux level;\na comparison with the XMM-Newton data implies an increase of a factor of 2.5 in\nthe 0.5-10 keV flux, in the 6 months separating the two observations. The iron\nK complex is detected in both datasets, with rather low equivalent width(s).\nThe intensity of the iron K complex does not respond to the change in continuum\nflux. An ultra-fast, high-ionization outflowing gas is clearly detected in the\nXIS data; the absorber is most likely unstable. Indeed, during the XMM-Newton\nobservation, which was 6 months after, the absorber was not detected. No clear\nroll-over in the hard X-ray emission is detected, probably due to the emergence\nof the jet as a dominant component in the hard X-ray band, as suggested by the\ndetection above ~ 100 keV with the GSO on-board Suzaku, although the present\ndata do not allow us to firmly constrain the relative contribution of the\ndifferent components. The fluxes observed by the gamma-ray satellites CGRO and\nFermi would be compatible with the putative jet component if peaking at\nenergies E ~ 100 MeV. In the X-ray band, the jet contribution to the continuum\nstarts to be significant only above 10 keV. If the detection of the jet\ncomponent in 3C 111 is confirmed, then its relative importance in the X-ray\nenergy band could explain the different observed properties in the high-energy\nemission of BLRGs, which are otherwise similar in their other multiwavelength\nproperties. Comparison between X-ray and gamma-ray data taken at different\nepochs suggests that the strong variability observed for 3C 111 is probably\ndriven by a change in the primary continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 12:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The typical signal which is looked\nat refers to the muon neutrino component and consists of a flux of up-going\nmuons in a neutrino detector. We propose instead a novel signature: the\npossibility of looking at the tau neutrino component of the dark matter signal,\nwhich is almost background-free in the downward-going direction, since the tau\nneutrino amount in atmospheric neutrinos is negligible and in the down-going\nbaseline atmospheric muon-neutrinos have no time to sizably oscillate. We\nanalyze the prospects of studying the downward-going tau neutrinos from dark\nmatter annihilation (or decay) in the Sun in Cherenkov detectors, by looking at\nhadronic showers produced in the charged-current tau neutrino interactions and\nsubsequent tau decay. We discuss the various sources of background (namely the\nsmall tau neutrino component in atmospheric neutrinos, both from direct\nproduction and from oscillations; tau neutrinos from solar corona interactions;\nthe galactic tau neutrino component) as well as sources of background due to\nmisidentification of electron and muon events. We find that the downward-going\ntau neutrinos signal has potentially very good prospects for Mton scale\nCherenkov detectors, the main limitation being the level of misidentification\nof non-tau events, which need to be kept at level of percent. Several tens of\nevents per year (depending on the dark matter mass and annihilation/decay\nchannel) are potentially collectible with a Mton scale detector, and a 5 sigma\nsignificance discovery is potentially reachable for dark matter masses in the\nrange from 20 to 300 GeV with a few years of exposure on a Mton detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 14:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 11:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-25"}

Our model is based on the set of coupled equations,\nwhich incorporates well-established density matrix formalism appropriate for\nquantum systems (CNT are described as a two level system) and\nharmonic-oscillator approach ideal for modelling sub-wavelength plasmonic and\noptical resonators. We show that the saturation nonlinearity of CNT increases\nmultifold in the resonantly enhanced near field of a metamaterial. In the\nframework of our model, we discuss the effect of inhomogeneity of the CNT layer\n(band gap value distribution) on the nonlinearity enhancement. It is shown,\nthat the Purcell effect is indistinguishable from the field enhancement and is\ndescribed by the same phenomenological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 15:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2011 10:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-25"}

By virtue of an\nextremely useful tool for analyzing entanglement properties of quantum\noperations, namely, operator-Schmidt decomposition, we provide alternative\nproof to the \"no-go\" theorem and also study the role of initial correlations\nbetween the qubits and ancilla in sequential preparation of unitary entanglers.\nDespite the negative response from the \"no-go\" theorem, we demonstrate\nexplicitly how the matrix-product operator(MPO) formalism provides a flexible\nstructure to develop protocols for sequential implementation of such entanglers\nwith an optimal fidelity. The proposed numerical technique, that we call\nvariational matrix-product operator (VMPO), offers a computationally efficient\ntool for characterizing the \"globalness\" and entangling capabilities of\nnonlocal unitary operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 15:51:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 14:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The transition profile which connects the\nexterior Reissner-Nordstrom solution with the novel interior is analytically\nderived. The inner core is characterized by a vanishing spatial volume and\nconstant surface gravity, and in some respects, resembles a maximally stretched\nhorizon. The Komar mass residing inside any concentric interior sphere is\nproportional to the surface area of that sphere, and consequently, is\nnon-negative definite and furthermore non-singular at the origin. The Kruskal\nstructure is recovered, admitting the exact Hawking imaginary time periodicity,\nbut unconventionally, with the conic defect defused at the origin. The\ncorresponding holographic entropy packing locally saturates the 't\nHooft-Susskind-Bousso holographic bound, thus making the core Nature's ultimate\ninformation storage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 15:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-13"}
