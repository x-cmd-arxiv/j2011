We analyze the properties\nof bound states, virtual states, and resonances in a single-channel chiral\nunitary approach, paying attention to the energy dependence of the chiral\ninteraction. We define the compositeness of a bound state using the field\nrenormalization constant which is given by the overlap of the bare state and\nthe physical state in the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, or by the residue\nof the bound state propagator in the relativistic field theory. The field\nrenormalization constant enables one to define a normalized quantitative\nmeasure of compositeness of the bound state. Applying this scheme to the chiral\nunitary approach, we find that the bound state generated by the\nenergy-independent interaction is always a purely composite particle, while the\nenergy-dependent chiral interaction introduces the elementary component,\ndepending on the value of the cutoff parameter. This feature agrees with the\nanalysis of the effective interaction by changing the cutoff parameter. A\npurely composite bound state can be realized by the chiral interaction only\nwhen the bound state lies at the threshold or when the strength of the two-body\nattractive interaction is infinitely large. The natural renormalization scheme,\nintroduced by the property of the loop function and the matching with the\nchiral low-energy theorem, is shown to generate a bound state which is\ndominated by the composite structure when the binding energy is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 12:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 07:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-06"}

As shown by Anderson in 1967, the scattering phase\nshifts of the single-particle wave functions constituting the Fermi sea have to\nadjust in response to the sudden change in the local parameters of the\nHamiltonian, causing the initial and final ground states to be orthogonal. This\nso-called Anderson orthogonality catastrophe also influences dynamical\nproperties, such as spectral functions. Their low-frequency behaviour shows\nnontrivial power laws, with exponents that can be understood using a\ngeneralization of simple arguments introduced by Hopfield and others for the\nX-ray edge singularity problem. The goal of this work is to formulate these\ngeneralized rules, as well as to numerically illustrate them for quantum\nquenches in impurity models involving local interactions. As a simple yet\ninstructive example, we use the interacting resonant level model as testing\nground for our generalized Hopfield rule. We then analyse a model exhibiting\npopulation switching between two dot levels as a function of gate voltage,\nprobed by a local Coulomb interaction with an additional lead serving as charge\nsensor. We confirm a recent prediction that charge sensing can induce a quantum\nphase transition for this system, causing the population switch to become\nabrupt. We elucidate the role of Anderson orthogonality for this effect by\nexplicitly calculating the relevant orthogonality exponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 13:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2011 14:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-16"}

We\nhave found that even with relativistic considerations these species are stably\nbound within the field. It was also found that performing the dimensional\nscaling calculations for systems within the confines of laser fields to be a\nmuch simpler and more cost-effective method than the supporting D=3 SCF method.\nThe dimensional scaling method is general and can be extended to include\nrelativistic corrections to describe the stability of simple molecular systems\nin super-intense laser fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 14:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We subsequently provide brief descriptions of\na few popular models that aim to solve the issues that arise within the SM. In\nchapter 3 we describe the general Monte Carlo method and show how it can be\nused to construct a class of computational tools called Monte Carlo event\ngenerators. We describe the main generic features of event generators and how\nthese are implemented in the HERWIG++ event generator. By applying resummation\ntechniques, we provide, in chapter 4, analytical calculations of two types of\nhadron collider observables: global inclusive variables and the transverse\nenergy of the QCD initial state radiation (ET), associated with the either\nDrell-Yan gauge boson production or Higgs boson production. In both cases we\nprovide comparisons to results obtained from Monte Carlo event generators. In\nchapter 5 we examine two well-motivated models for new physics: one of new\nheavy charged vector bosons (W prime) and a model motivated by strong dynamics\nelectroweak symmetry breaking that contains new resonances, leptoquarks, that\ncouple primarily to quarks and leptons of the third generation. In the prior\nmodel, we improve the current treatment of the W' by considering interference\neffects with the SM W and construct an event generator accurate to\nnext-to-leading order which we use to conduct a phenomenological analysis. For\nthe leptoquark model, we provide an implementation in the HERWIG++ event\ngenerator and use it to form a strategy for mass reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 15:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-30"}

It involves\nfinding the global maximum of the likelihood function in the multi-dimensional\nparameter space. Currently sampling based methods, which are in general\nstochastic in nature, like Markov-Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC), are being commonly\nused for parameter estimation. The beauty of stochastic methods is that the\ncomputational cost grows, at the most, linearly in place of exponentially (as\nin grid based approaches) with the dimensionality of the search space. MCMC\nmethods sample the full joint probability distribution (posterior) from which\none and two dimensional probability distributions, best fit (average) values of\nparameters and then error bars can be computed. In the present work we\ndemonstrate the application of another stochastic method, named Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO), that is widely used in the field of engineering and\nartificial intelligence, for cosmological parameter estimation from WMAP seven\nyears data. We find that there is a good agreement between the values of the\nbest fit parameters obtained from PSO and publicly available code COSMOMC.\nHowever, there is a slight disagreement between error bars mainly due to the\nfact that errors are computed differently in PSO. Apart from presenting the\nresults of our exercise, we also discuss the merits of PSO and explain its\nusefulness in more extensive search in higher dimensional parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 15:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 03:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

This affects the analysis of compression\nwave experiments and the resulting extraction of the high-pressure equation of\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 15:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In\norder to model the gravitational waveform of the merger epoch of compact binary\ncoalescence, the full Einstein equations must be solved numerically for the\nentire mass and spin parameter space. However, this is computationally\nexpensive. Several models have been proposed to interpolate the results of\nnumerical relativity simulations. In this paper we propose a numerical\ninterpolation scheme that stems from the singular value decomposition. This\nalgorithm shows promise in allowing one to construct arbitrary waveforms within\na certain parameter space given a sufficient density of numerical simulations\ncovering the same parameter space. We also investigate how similar approaches\ncould be used to interpolate waveforms in the context of parameter estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 15:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Until now, this task has been\nposed as a typical query-by-example task, where one submits a query song and\nthe system retrieves a list of possible matches ranked by their similarity to\nthe query. In this work, we propose a new approach which uses song communities\nto provide more relevant answers to a given query. Starting from the output of\na state-of-the-art system, songs are embedded in a complex weighted network\nwhose links represent similarity (related musical content). Communities inside\nthe network are then recognized as groups of covers and this information is\nused to enhance the results of the system. In particular, we show that this\napproach increases both the coherence and the accuracy of the system.\nFurthermore, we provide insight into the internal organization of individual\ncover song communities, showing that there is a tendency for the original song\nto be central within the community. We postulate that the methods and results\npresented here could be relevant to other query-by-example tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 15:25:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 10:46:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}
