In the first half, as the standards of iterative direct\nminimization strategies, two types of simple recursive methods are presented,\nnamely the two-term method and the three-term method. The dual estimate is also\nintroduced as a powerful means of involving equally constraint conditions into\nminimization problems. As examples of direct minimization approaches on usual\nengineering issues, some form finding problems of tension structures which can\nbe solved by the presented strategies are illustrated. Additionally, it is\npointed out that while the two-term method sometimes becomes useless, the\nthree-term method always provides remarkable rate of global convergence\nefficiency. Then, to show the potential ability of the three-term method, in\nthe last part of this work, some principle of virtual works which usually\nappear in the continuum mechanics are approximated and discretized in a common\nmanner, which are suitable to be solved by the three-term method.

Relating this\nframework to that of webs, we derive renormalization constraints expressing all\nmultiple poles of any given web in terms of lower-order webs.

The precise determination of the mass and\nphotometry of the close companion to ABDorA, ABDorC, has provided an important\nbenchmark for calibration of theoretical evolutionary models of low-mass stars.\nThe limiting factor to the precision of this calibration is the age of the\nsystem, as both the mass and luminosity of ABDorA and C are well monitored by\nother ongoing programs.

The latter estimate, combined with other fundamental parameters also\nmeasured for this star, allows a precise test of PMS evolutionary models using\nboth H-R diagrams and mass-radius relationships. We have found that our radius\nmeasurement is larger than that predicted by the models, which we interpret as\nan evidence of the oversizing produced by the strong magnetic activity of\nABDorA.

In the case of linear control, we provide\nquantitative scaling laws of the stability margin and sensitivity to external\ndisturbances (H-infinity norm) with respect to the number of vehicles $N$ in\nthe formation. It is shown that the formation with directed tree graph achieves\nsize-independent stability margin but suffers from high algebraic growth of\ninitial errors. The stability margin in case of the undirected graph decays to\n0 as at least $O(1/N)$. In addition, we show that the sensitivity to external\ndisturbances in directed tree graphs is geometric in $k$ where $k <= N$ is the\nnumber of generations of the directed tree, while that of the undirected graph\nis only quadratic in $N$.

In this paper, we propose\ntwo algorithms schemas for the link state protocol to reroute the traffic in\ntwo states; first, pre-calculated an alternative and disjoint path with the\nprimary one from the source to the destination by re-routing traffic through\nit, regardless of the locations of failure and the number of failed links.\nSecond, rerouting the traffic via an alternative path from a node whose local\nlink is down without the need to wait until the source node knows about the\nfailure. This is achieved by creating a new backup routing table based on the\noriginal routing table which is computed by the dijkstra algorithm. The goal of\nthese algorithms is to reduce loss of packets, end-to-end delay time, improve\nthroughput and avoiding local loop when nodes re-converge the topology in case\nof failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 23:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-09"}

To address this question we propose a\nstatistical model for graph/class pairs. This model naturally leads to a set of\nestimators to identify the class-conditional signal, or \"signal-subgraph,\"\ndefined as the collection of edges that are probabilistically different between\nthe classes. The estimators admit classifiers which are asymptotically optimal\nand efficient, but differ by their assumption about the \"coherency\" of the\nsignal-subgraph (coherency is the extent to which the signal-edges \"stick\ntogether\" around a common subset of vertices). Via simulation, the best\nestimator is shown to be not just a function of the coherency of the model, but\nalso the number of training samples. These estimators are employed to address a\ncontemporary neuroscience question: can we classify \"connectomes\"\n(brain-graphs) according to sex? The answer is yes, and significantly better\nthan all benchmark algorithms considered. Synthetic data analysis demonstrates\nthat even when the model is correct, given the relatively small number of\ntraining samples, the estimated signal-subgraph should be taken with a grain of\nsalt. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2011 00:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 03:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-13"}

To investigate short-timescale\nvariability in young, low-mass objects, we carried out high-precision,\nhigh-cadence time series monitoring with the Warm Spitzer mission on 14 low\nmass stars and brown dwarfs in the ~3 Myr Sigma Orionis cluster. The flux in\nmany of our raw light curves is strongly correlated with sub-pixel position and\ncan vary systematically as much as 10%.

Zn induced rate of suppression of Tc, dTc(p)/dy, was found to\nbe strongly p-dependent and showed a monotonic variation with p, except in the\nvicinity of p ~ 0.125, i.e., near the so-called 1/8th anomaly where the\ncharge/spin stripe correlations are at their strongest in hole doped cuprates.\nThe magnitude of dTc(p)/dy decreased significantly around this hole\nconcentration implying that Zn suddenly became less effective in degrading Tc\nnear the 1/8th anomaly for La2-xSrxCu1-yZnyO4. The same feature, somewhat at a\nreduced scale, was also observed for YBa2(Cu1-yZny)3O7-d compounds. This is\ncounterintuitive since static stripe order itself degrades superconducting\norder.

Given the permission of unlicensed access to TV white spaces, WSPs\ncan alleviate their burden by exploiting the concept of \"capacity offload\" to\ntransfer part of their traffic load to unlicensed spectrum. For such use cases,\na central problem is for WSPs to coexist with others, since all of them may\naccess the unlicensed spectrum without coordination thus interfering each\nother. Game theory provides tools for predicting the behavior of WSPs, and we\nformulate the coexistence problem under the framework of non-cooperative games\nas a capacity offload game (COG). We show that a COG always possesses at least\none pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE), and does not have any mixed-strategy\nNE. The analysis provides a full characterization of the structure of the NEs\nin two-player COGs. When the game is played repeatedly and each WSP\nindividually updates its strategy based on its best-response function, the\nresulting process forms a best-response dynamic. We establish that, for\ntwo-player COGs, alternating-move best-response dynamics always converge to an\nNE, while simultaneous-move best-response dynamics does not always converge to\nan NE when multiple NEs exist. When there are more than two players in a COG,\nif the network configuration satisfies certain conditions so that the resulting\nbest-response dynamics become linear, both simultaneous-move and\nalternating-move best-response dynamics are guaranteed to converge to the\nunique NE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2011 07:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-09"}

Kinesthetic and\ncutaneous force feedback are substituted by cutaneous feedback (CF) only,\nprovided by two wearable devices able to apply forces to the index finger and\nthe thumb, while holding a handle during a teleoperation task. The force\npattern, fed back to the user while using the cutaneous devices, is similar, in\nterms of intensity and area of application, to the cutaneous force pattern\napplied to the finger pad while interacting with a haptic device providing both\ncutaneous and kinesthetic force feedback. The pattern generated using the\ncutaneous devices can be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic\nfeedback (HF) and the kinesthetic part of it. For this reason, we refer to this\napproach as sensory subtraction instead of sensory substitution. A needle\ninsertion scenario is considered to validate the approach. The haptic device is\nconnected to a virtual environment simulating a needle insertion task.\nExperiments show that the perception of inserting a needle using the\ncutaneous-only force feedback is nearly indistinguishable from the one felt by\nthe user while using both cutaneous and kinesthetic feedback. As most of the\nsensory substitution approaches, the proposed sensory subtraction technique\nalso has the advantage of not suffering from stability issues of teleoperation\nsystems due, for instance, to communication delays. Moreover, experiments show\nthat the sensory subtraction technique outperforms sensory substitution with\nmore conventional visual feedback (VF).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2011 08:37:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 16:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 17:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-28"}

Such a 3D matter distribution map\ncan be used to test the Cosmological model and to constrain the Dark Energy\nproperties or its equation of state. A novel approach, called intensity mapping\ncan be used to map the HI distribution, using radio interferometers with large\ninstantaneous field of view and waveband. In this paper, we study the\nsensitivity of different radio interferometer configurations, or multi-beam\ninstruments for the observation of large scale structures and BAO oscillations\nin 21cm and we discuss the problem of foreground removal. For each\nconfiguration, we determine instrument response by computing the (u,v) or\nFourier angular frequency plane coverage using visibilities. The (u,v) plane\nresponse is the noise power spectrum, hence the instrument sensitivity for LSS\nP(k) measurement. We describe also a simple foreground subtraction method to\nseparate LSS 21 cm signal from the foreground due to the galactic synchrotron\nand radio sources emission. We have computed the noise power spectrum for\ndifferent instrument configuration as well as the extracted LSS power spectrum,\nafter separation of 21cm-LSS signal from the foregrounds. We have also obtained\nthe uncertainties on the Dark Energy parameters for an optimized 21 cm BAO\nsurvey.

The ray is believed to be associated with the current\nsheet structure that formed as a result of solar eruption, and the blobs are\nproducts of magnetic reconnection occurring along the current sheet. The ray\nmorphology and blob dynamics are investigated statistically. It is found that\nthe apparent angular widths of the rays at a fixed time vary in a range of\n2.1-6.6 (2.0-4.4) degrees with an average of 3.5 (2.9) degrees at 3 (4) Rs,\nrespectively, and the observed durations of the events vary from 12 h to a few\ndays with an average of 27 h. It is also found, based on the analysis of blob\nmotions, that 58% (26) of the blobs were accelerated, 20% (9) were decelerated,\nand 22% (10) moved with a nearly-constant speed. Comparing the dynamics of our\nblobs and those that are observed above the tip of a helmet streamer, we find\nthat the speeds and accelerations of the blobs in these two cases differ\nsignificantly. It is suggested that these differences of the blob dynamics stem\nfrom the associated magnetic reconnection involving different magnetic field\nconfigurations and triggering processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2011 12:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

However, when the number of categories is\nlarge, both methods are not locally consistent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2011 06:10:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 09:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-23"}

Post-layout Simulation results show that the level of output power\ncan be controlled in 2dBm steps; especially the output power in every step is\nquite insensitive to temperature variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2011 02:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-02"}

The limited available spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum\nusage necessitate a new communication paradigm to exploit the existing wireless\nspectrum opportunistically. Cognitive radio is a paradigm for wireless\ncommunication in which either a network or a wireless node changes its\ntransmission or reception parameters to communicate efficiently avoiding\ninterference with licensed or unlicensed users. In this work, a fuzzy logic\nbased system for spectrum management is proposed where the radio can share\nunused spectrum depending on some parameters like distance, signal strength,\nnode velocity and availability of unused spectrum.
