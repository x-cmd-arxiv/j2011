Combining both analytical and\nnumerical renormalization group techniques, we characterize the impurity phases\nand quantum phase transitions of the relevant Kondo and Anderson models. The\nline of stable points, corresponding to the overscreened non-Fermi liquid\nbehavior of the metallic $r=0$ case, is replaced by a stable particle-hole\nsymmetric intermediate-coupling fixed point for $0<r<\\rmax\\approx0.23$. For\n$r>\\rmax$, this non-Fermi liquid phase disappears, and instead a critical fixed\npoint with an emergent spin--channel symmetry appears, controlling the quantum\nphase transition between two phases with stable spin and channel moments,\nrespectively. We propose low-energy field theories to describe the quantum\nphase transitions, all being formulated in fermionic variables. We employ\nepsilon expansion techniques to calculate critical properties near the critical\ndimensions $r=0$ and $r=1$, the latter being potentially relevant for\ntwo-channel Kondo impurities in neutral graphene. We find the analytical\nresults to be in excellent agreement with those obtained from applying Wilson's\nnumerical renormalization group technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 16:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 09:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

For such an algebraic curvature\ntensor, we show that if the vector space $V$ is a direct sum of subspaces $V_1$\nand $V_2$, the corresponding structure group decomposes as well if $V_1$ and\n$V_2$ are invariant of the action of the structure group on $V$.

At low temperatures or for large\ndifferences in material properties, the surface heating rate dominates the bulk\nheating rate near the surface. We also consider the case, noted by Rashba,\nwhere bulk spin currents occur in equilibrium. Although a surface spin current\n(in A/m^{2}) should yield about the same rate of heating as an equal surface\nelectric current, production of such a spin current requires a relatively large\n\"magnetization potential\" difference across the interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 19:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 23:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Quantifying the degree to which this feature in\nthe temperature data is in conflict with standard Lambda-CDM cosmology is\nsomewhat ambiguous because of the a posteriori nature of the observation. One\nphysical mechanism that has been proposed as a possible explanation for the\ndeficit in the large-angle temperature correlations is a suppression of\nprimordial power on ~Gpc scales. To distinguish whether the anomaly is a signal\nof new physics, such as suppressed primordial power, it would be invaluable to\nperform experimental tests of the authenticity of this signal in data sets\nwhich are independent of the WMAP temperature measurements or even other CMB\nmeasurements. We explore the possibility of testing models of power suppression\nwith large-scale structure observations, and compare the ability of planned\nphotometric and spectroscopic surveys to constrain the power spectrum. Of the\nsurveys planned for the next decade, a spectroscopic redshift survey such as\nBigBOSS will have a greater number of radial modes available for study, but we\nfind that this advantage is outweighed by the greater surface density of\nhigh-redshift sources that will be observed by photometric surveys such as LSST\nor Euclid.

We conclude that very-wide-area imaging surveys have the potential\nto probe viable models for the missing power but that it will be difficult to\nuse such surveys to conclusively rule out primordial power suppression as the\nmechanism behind the observed anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 19:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 19:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In order to infer relaxation\ndriven effects and to increase the statistical significance, a very large set\nof N-body integrations with different particle numbers N, ranging from 10^{3}\nto 0.5 \\cdot 10^{6} particles, is performed. Three different black hole capture\nradii are taken into account, enabling us to scale these results to a broad\nrange of astrophysical systems with relaxation times shorter than one Hubble\ntime, i.e. for SMBHs up to M_bh \\approx 10^{7} M_sun. The computed number of\ndisrupted stars are driven by diffusion in angular momentum space into the loss\ncone of the black hole and the rate scales with the total number of particles\nas dN/dt \\propto N^{b}, where b is as large as 0.83. This is significantly\nsteeper than the expected scaling dN/dt \\propto ln(N) derived from simplest\nenergy relaxation arguments. Only a relatively modest dependence of the tidal\ndisruption rate on the mass of the SMBH is found and we discuss our results in\nthe context of the M_bh/sigma relation. The number of disrupted stars\ncontribute a significant part to the mass growth of black holes in the lower\nmass range as long as a significant part of the stellar mass becomes swallowed\nby the SMBH. This also bears direct consequences for the search and existence\nof IMBHs in globular clusters. For SMBHs similar to the galactic center black\nhole SgrA*, a tidal disruption rate of 55 \\pm 27 events per Myr is deduced.\nFinally relaxation driven stellar feeding can not account for the masses of\nmassive black holes M_bh \\geq 10^{7} M_sun.

This modification of transport processes is of vital importance for\na wide variety of astrophysical processes including cosmic ray transport,\ntransfer of heavy elements in the interstellar medium, star formation etc.\nDealing with these processes one should keep in mind that in realistic\nastrophysical conditions magnetized fluids are turbulent. In this review we\nsingle out a single transport process, namely, heat transfer and consider how\nit occurs in the presence of the magnetized turbulence. We show that the\nability of magnetic field lines to constantly change topology and connectivity\nis at the heart of the correct description of the 3D magnetic field\nstochasticity in turbulent fluids. This ability is ensured by fast magnetic\nreconnection in turbulent fluids and puts forward the concept of reconnection\ndiffusion at the core of the physical picture of heat transfer in astrophysical\nplasmas. Appealing to reconnection diffusion we describe the ability of plasma\nto diffuse between different magnetized eddies explaining the advection of the\nheat by turbulence. Adopting the structure of magnetic field that follows from\nthe modern understanding of MHD turbulence, we also discuss thermal\nconductivity that arises as electrons stream along stochastic magnetic field\nlines. We compare the effective heat transport that arise from the two\nprocesses and conclude that in many astrophysically-motivated cased eddy\nadvection of heat dominates.

The well-known, logarithmic Salpeter\nslope GAMMA=1.35 in clusters is then the aggregate slope for all the\nstar-forming clumps contributing to an individual cluster, and it is steeper\nthan the intrinsic slope within individual clumps because the smallest\nstar-forming clumps contributing to any given cluster are unable to form the\nhighest-mass stars. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the Salpeter\npower-law index is the limiting value obtained for the cluster IMF when the\nlower-mass limits for allowed stellar masses and star-forming clumps are\neffectively equal, m_lo = M_lo. This condition indeed is imposed for the\nhigh-mass IMF tail by the turn-over at the characteristic value m_c ~ 1 M_sun.\nIMF slopes of GAMMA ~ 2 are obtained if the stellar and clump upper-mass limits\nare also equal m_up = M_up ~ 100 M_sun, and so our model explains the observed\nrange of IMF slopes between GAMMA ~ 1 to 2.

If\na parabola is added to each limit curve, an x-translation invariant process\nsometimes called the multi-line Airy process is obtained. We prove the\nexistence of a version of this process (which we call the Airy line ensemble)\nin which curves are a.s. everywhere continuous and non-intersecting.

We perform\na Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for each planet and combine these\ndata with previous measurements to redetermine the period and ephemerides for\nthese planets. These observations provide recent mid-transit times which are\nuseful for scheduling future observations. Our results improve the ephemerides\nof WASP-4b, WASP-5b and WASP-6b and reduce the uncertainties on the mid-transit\ntime for WASP-29b. We also confirm the orbital, stellar and planetary\nparameters of all 6 systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 23:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 20:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The control law is usually a complex feedback law which is\nderived from a (nonlinear) model, possibly complemented with some mathematical\nenvelope of the model uncertainty. Stability may be guarantee with the help of\nsome ignorance coefficients and restricting the feedback control effort with\nrespect to the model-based design. Embedded Model Control shows that under\ncertain conditions, the model-based control law must and can be kept intact\nunder uncertainty, if the controllable dynamics is complemented by a suitable\ndisturbance dynamics capable of real-time encoding the different uncertainties\naffecting the 'embedded model', i.e. the model which is both the design source\nand the core of the control unit. To be real-time updated the disturbance state\nis driven by an unpredictable input vector, called noise, which can be only\nestimated from the model error. The uncertainty (or plant)-based design\nconcerns the noise estimator, as the model error may convey into the embedded\nmodel uncertainty components (parametric, cross-coupling, neglected dynamics)\nwhich are command-dependent and thus prone to destabilize the controlled plant.\nSeparation of the components into the low and high frequency domain by the\nnoise estimator allows to recover and guarantee stability, and to cancel the\nlow frequency ones from the plant. Among the advantages, control algorithms are\nneatly and univocally related to the embedded model, the embedded model\nprovides a real-time image of the plant, all control gains are tuned by fixing\nclosed-loop eigenvalues. Last but not least, the resulting control unit has\nmodular structure and algorithms, thus facilitating coding. A simulated case\nstudy helps to understand the key assets of the methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2011 07:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-12"}

In this paper, reprocessed data is presented that\nwas originally observed for the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS). HIPASS\nprovides complete coverage of the region that has been observed for the\nWesterbork Virgo Filament HI Survey (WVFS), presented in accompanying papers,\nand thus is an excellent product for data comparison.
