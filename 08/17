We find that the high scattering\nefficiency of clouds substantially causes both the amount of reflected light\nand the related depths of the absorption bands to be substantially larger than\nin comparison to the respective clear sky conditions. Low-level clouds have a\nstronger impact on the spectra than the high-level clouds because of their much\nlarger scattering optical depth.

However, the detectability of various chemical species in\nlow-resolution reflection spectra depends strongly on the spectral energy\ndistribution of the incident stellar radiation.

A few\nyears later, Moore noted that propositions like the one used by Reiter are\nfundamentally different than defaults and exhibit a certain autoepistemic\nnature. Thus, Reiter had developed his default logic as a formalization of\nautoepistemic propositions rather than of defaults.\n  The first goal of this paper is to show that some problems of Reiter's\ndefault logic as a formal way to reason about informal defaults are directly\nattributable to the autoepistemic nature of default logic and to the mismatch\nbetween informal defaults and the Reiter's formal defaults, the latter being a\nformal expression of the autoepistemic propositions Reiter used as a\nrepresentation of informal defaults.\n  The second goal of our paper is to compare the work of Reiter and Moore.\nWhile each of them attempted to formalize autoepistemic propositions, the modes\nof reasoning in their respective logics were different. We revisit Moore's and\nReiter's intuitions and present them from the perspective of autotheoremhood,\nwhere theories can include propositions referring to the theory's own theorems.\nWe then discuss the formalization of this perspective in the logics of Moore\nand Reiter, respectively, using the unifying semantic framework for default and\nautoepistemic logics that we developed earlier.

We investigate the dynamical evolution of the reconnection process\nat an initially linear 3D null point that is stressed by a localised shear\nmotion across the spine axis. The fan plane is not rotationally symmetric and\nthis allows for different behaviours depending on the alignment of the fan\nplane relative to the imposed driver direction. Aims. The aim is to show how\nthe current accumulation and the associated reconnection process depends on the\nrelative orientation between the driver imposed stress across the spine axis of\nthe null and the main eigenvector direction in the fan plane. Methods. The time\nevolution of the 3D null point is investigated solving the 3D non-ideal MHD\nequations numerically in a Cartesian box. The magnetic field is frozen to the\nboundaries and the boundary velocity is only non-zero where the imposed driving\nis for stressing the system is applied. Results. The current accumulation is\nfound to be along the direction of the fan eigenvector associated with the\nsmallest eigenvalue until the direction of the driver is almost parallel to\nthis eigenvector. When the driving velocity is parallel to the weak eigenvector\nand has an impulsive temporal profile the null only forms a weak current layer.\nHowever, when the null point is stressed continuously boundary effects\ndominates the current accumulation. Conclusions. There is a clear relation\nbetween the orientation of the current concentration and the direction of the\nfan eigenvector corresponding to the small eigenvalue. This shows that the\nstructure of the magnetic field is the most important in determining where\ncurrent is going to accumulate when a single 3D null point is perturbed by a\nsimple shear motion across the spine axis. As the angle between the driving\ndirection and the strong eigenvector direction increases, the current that\naccumulates at the null becomes progressively weaker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 18:14:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In modern\nhigh-dimensional applications, a common approach to finding sparse positive\ndefinite matrices is to threshold their small off-diagonal elements. This\nthresholding, sometimes referred to as hard-thresholding, sets small elements\nto zero. Thresholding has the attractive property that the resulting matrices\nare sparse, and are thus easier to interpret and work with. In many\napplications, it is often required, and thus implicitly assumed, that\nthresholded matrices retain positive definiteness. In this paper we formally\ninvestigate the algebraic properties of p.d. matrices which are thresholded. We\ndemonstrate that for positive definiteness to be preserved, the pattern of\nelements to be set to zero has to necessarily correspond to a graph which is a\nunion of disconnected complete components. This result rigorously demonstrates\nthat, except in special cases, positive definiteness can be easily lost. We\nthen proceed to demonstrate that the class of diagonally dominant matrices is\nnot maximal in terms of retaining positive definiteness when thresholded.\nConsequently, we derive characterizations of matrices which retain positive\ndefiniteness when thresholded with respect to important classes of graphs. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that retaining positive definiteness upon\nthresholding is governed by complex algebraic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 19:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-17"}

Out of 1636 galaxies with SDSS\nphotometry, we identify 48 detections; out of the 1063 galaxies that also have\nSDSS spectroscopy, we identify 33 detections. We find that maser detection rate\nis higher at higher optical luminosity (M_B), larger velocity dispersion\n($\\sigma$), and higher [OIII]5007 luminosity, with [OIII]5007 being the\ndominant factor. These detection rates are essentially the result of the\ncorrelations of isotropic maser luminosity with all three of these variables.\nThese correlations are natural if maser strength increases with central black\nhole mass and the level of AGN activity. We also find that the detection rate\nis higher in galaxies with higher extinction. Based on these results, we\npropose that maser surveys seeking to efficiently find masers should rank AGN\ntargets by extinction-corrected [OIII]5007 flux when available. This\nprioritization would improve maser detection efficiency, from an overall ~ 3%\nwithout pre-selection to ~ 16% for the strongest intrinsic [OIII]5007 emitters,\nby a factor of ~ 5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 20:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

To\nunderstand the phenomenon, super cells of CuTi alloy are constructed where Cu\natom is substituted by Ti randomly and at selective sites. For random\nsubstitution, the melting point decreases linearly with increase in Ti\nconcentration. A non-monotonous dependence is seen when Cu atoms at selective\nsites are replaced by Ti.

The amplification of seismic waves in surface soil\nlayers is mainly due to the velocity contrast between these layers and,\npossibly, to topographic effects around crests and hills. The influence of the\ngeometry of alluvial basins on the amplification process is also know to be\nlarge. Nevertheless, strong heterogeneities and complex geometries are not easy\nto take into account with all numerical methods. 2D/3D models are needed in\nmany situations and the efficiency/accuracy of the numerical methods in such\ncases is in question. Furthermore, the radiation conditions at infinity are not\neasy to handle with finite differences or finite/spectral elements whereas it\nis explicitely accounted in the Boundary Element Method. Various absorbing\nlayer methods (e.g. F-PML, M-PML) were recently proposed to attenuate the\nspurious wave reflections especially in some difficult cases such as shallow\nnumerical models or grazing incidences. Finally, strong earthquakes involve\nnonlinear effects in surficial soil layers. To model strong ground motion, it\nis thus necessary to consider the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of soils and\nsimultaneously investigate seismic wave propagation in complex 2D/3D geological\nstructures! Recent advances in numerical formulations and constitutive models\nin such complex situations are presented and discussed in this paper.

This approach assumes a set of admissible shape functions for the\neigenmodes and allows a fast estimation of the fundamental frequency of the\nbasin. The agreement between modal numerical results and experimental ones is\nsatisfactory. The simplified modal method then appears as an efficient mean for\nthe global vibratory characterization of geological structures towards\nresonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 06:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-18"}

This paper presents a hybrid supervisory control framework\nfor the three-dimensional leader follower formation control of unmanned\nhelicopters. The proposed hybrid control framework captures internal\ninteractions between the decision making unit and the path planner continuous\ndynamics of the system, and hence improves the system's overall reliability. To\ndesign such a hybrid controller, a spherical abstraction of the state space is\nproposed as a new method of abstraction. Utilizing the properties of\nmulti-affine functions over the partitioned space leads to a finite state\nDiscrete Event System (DES) model, which is shown to be bisimilar to the\noriginal continuous-variable dynamical system. Then, in the discrete domain, a\nlogic supervisor is modularly designed for the abstracted model. Due to the\nbisimilarity between the abstracted DES model and the original UAV dynamics,\nthe designed logic supervisor can be implemented as a hybrid controller through\nan interface layer. This supervisor drives the UAV dynamics to satisfy the\ndesign requirements. In other words, the hybrid controller is able to bring the\nUAVs to the desired formation starting from any initial state inside the\ncontrol horizon and then, maintain the formation. Moreover, a collision\navoidance mechanism is embedded in the designed supervisor. Finally, the\nalgorithm has been verified by a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform,\nwhich is developed for unmanned helicopters. The presented results show the\neffectiveness of the algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 06:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The abstraction theory therefore provides a mechanism for coping with\nthe state space explosion problem and supports the analysis and comparison of\nmulti-valued networks. We take as our starting point the abstraction theory for\nsynchronous multi-valued networks which is based on the finite set of traces\nthat represent the behaviour of such a model. The problem with extending this\napproach to the asynchronous case is that we can now have an infinite set of\ntraces associated with a model making a simple trace inclusion test infeasible.\nTo address this we develop a decision procedure for checking asynchronous\nabstractions based on using the finite state graph of an asynchronous\nmulti-valued network to reason about its trace semantics.

We also confirm strong 2 kG magnetic field in the primary\nof the triple system GJ 2005. No fields could be accurately determined in\nrapidly rotating stars with $\\vsini>10$ \\kms. For slow and moderately rotating\nstars we find the surface magnetic field strength to increase with the\nrotational velocity $\\vsini$ which is consistent with other results from\nstudying field stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 12:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The proposals could potentially be\ntested with numerical simulations. Outgoing and ingoing particles free-falling\nin the parent Kerr geometry become highly focused along the principal outgoing\nand ingoing null directions as they approach the inner horizon, triggering the\nmass inflation instability. The original arguments of Barrabes, Israel &\nPoisson (1990) regarding inflation in rotating black holes are reviewed, and\nshown to be based on Raychauduri's equation applied along the outgoing and\ningoing null directions. It is argued that gravitational waves should behave in\nthe geometric optics limit, and consequently that the spacetime should be\nalmost shear-free. A full set of shear-free equations is derived. A specific\nline-element is proposed, which is argued should provide a satisfactory\napproximation during early inflation. Finally, it is argued that\nsuper-Planckian collisions between outgoing and ingoing particles will lead to\nentropy production, bringing inflation to an end, and precipitating collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 15:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-22"}

It is shown that the most\ngeneral cubic action for the tensor perturbation (gravitational wave) $h_{ij}$\nis composed only of two contributions, one with two spacial derivatives and the\nother with one time derivative on each $h_{ij}$. The former is essentially\nidentical to the cubic term that appears in Einstein gravity and predicts a\nsqueezed shape, while the latter newly appears in the presence of the kinetic\ncoupling to the Einstein tensor and predicts an equilateral shape. Thus, only\ntwo shapes appear in the graviton bispectrum of the most general single-field\ninflation model, which could open a new clue to the identification of\ninflationary gravitational waves in observations of cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies as well as direct gravitational wave detection experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 15:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In the calculations, the\nmass of the prestellar cloud is parameterized. During the star formation, the\nprotostellar outflow is driven by the circumstellar disk. The outflow extends\nalso in the transverse direction until its width becomes comparable to the\ninitial cloud scale, and thus, the outflow has a wide opening angle of >40\ndegrees. As a result, the protostellar outflow sweeps up a large fraction of\nthe infalling material and ejects it into the interstellar space. The outflow\ncan eject at most over half of the host cloud mass, significantly decreasing\nstar formation efficiency. The outflow power is stronger in clouds with a\ngreater initial mass. Thus, the protostellar outflow effectively suppresses\nstar formation efficiency in a massive cloud. The outflow weakens significantly\nand disappears in several free-fall timescales of the initial cloud after the\ncloud begins to collapse. The natal prestellar core influences the lifetime and\nsize of the outflow. At the end of the main accretion phase, a massive\ncircumstellar disk comparable in mass to the protostar remains. Calculations\nshow that typically, ~30% of the initial cloud mass is converted into the\nprotostar and ~20% remains in the circumstellar disk, while ~40% is ejected\ninto the interstellar space by the protostellar outflow. Therefore, a single\ncloud core typically has a star formation efficiency of 30-50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 01:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
