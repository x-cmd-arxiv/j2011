We present a new data-driven model for roll\ncall voting that is geometric in nature. We construct the model by adapting the\n\"Partition Decoupling Method,\" an unsupervised learning technique originally\ndeveloped for the analysis of families of time series, to produce a multiscale\ngeometric description of a weighted network associated to a set of roll call\nvotes. Central to this approach is the quantitative notion of a \"motivation,\" a\ncluster-based and learned basis element that serves as a building block in the\nrepresentation of roll call data. Motivations enable the formulation of a\nquantitative description of ideology and their data-dependent nature makes\npossible a quantitative analysis of the evolution of ideological factors. This\napproach is generally applicable to roll call data and we apply it in\nparticular to the historical roll call voting of the U.S. House and Senate.\nThis methodology provides a mechanism for estimating the dimension of the\nunderlying action space. We determine that the dominant factors form a low-\n(one- or two-) dimensional representation with secondary factors adding\nhigher-dimensional features. In this way our work supports and extends the\nfindings of both Poole-Rosenthal and Heckman-Snyder concerning the\ndimensionality of the action space. We give a detailed analysis of several\nindividual Senates and use the AdaBoost technique from statistical learning to\ndetermine those votes with the most powerful discriminatory value. When used as\na predictive model, this geometric view significantly outperforms spatial\nmodels such as the Poole-Rosenthal DW-NOMINATE model and the Heckman-Snyder\n6-factor model, both in raw accuracy as well as Aggregate Proportional Reduced\nError (APRE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2011 16:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-16"}

The\nmechanical properties of this cross-linked structure were determined using MD\nsimulations and the results were verified with those available in literatures.\nGraphene with different aspect ratios and concentrations (1%, 3% and 5%) were\nconsidered in order to construct amorphous unit cells of Gr-Ep nanocomposites.\nThe Gr-Ep nanocomposites system undergoes NVT (constant number of atoms, volume\nand temperature) and NPT (constant number of atoms, pressure and temperature)\nensemble with applied uniform strain field during MD simulation to obtain bulk\nYoung's modulus and shear modulus. The stress-strain response was also\nevaluated for both amorphous and crystalline unit cells of Gr-Ep system under\nuni-axial deformation. The cohesive and pullout force vs. displacement response\nwere determined for graphenes with different size. Hence as primary goal of\nthis work, a parametric study using MD simulation was conducted for\ncharacterizing interfacial properties and elastic constants with different NGS\naspect rations and volume fractions. The MD simulation results show reasonable\nagreement with available published data in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2011 21:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 20:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-12"}

The best\nknown exponent is 2.376, due to Coppersmith and Winograd. Many attempts to\nsolve this problems in the literature work by solving, fixed-size problems and\nthen apply the solution recursively. This leads to pure combinatorial\noptimisation problems with fixed size. These problems are unlikely to be\nsolvable in polynomial time.\n  In 1976 Laderman published a method to multiply two 3x3 matrices using only\n23 multiplications. This result is non-commutative, and therefore can be\napplied recursively to smaller sub-matrices. In 35 years nobody was able to do\nbetter and it remains an open problem if this can be done with 22\nmultiplications. We proceed by solving the so called Brent equations [7]. We\nhave implemented a method to converting this very hard problem to a SAT\nproblem, and we have attempted to solve it, with our portfolio of some 500 SAT\nsolvers. With this new method we were able to produce new solutions to the\nLaderman's problem. We present a new fully general non-commutative solution\nwith 23 multiplications and show that this solution is new and is NOT an\nequivalent variant of the Laderman's original solution. This result\ndemonstrates that the space of solutions to Laderman's problem is larger than\nexpected, and therefore it becomes now more plausible that a solution with 22\nmultiplications exists. If it exists, we might be able to find it soon just by\nrunning our algorithms longer, or due to further improvements in the SAT solver\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2011 00:23:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 23:13:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 09:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-22"}

In order to establish universal characteristic\nproperties of the process, we explore three different models ---\nFrenkel-Kontorova (FK), phi4+ ($\\phi^4$+) and phi4- ($\\phi^4-$). Direct numeric\nsimulations reveal in all these models a crossover from oscillatory decay of\nshort-wave perturbations of the temperature field to smooth diffusive decay of\nthe long-wave perturbations. Such behavior is inconsistent with parabolic\nFourier equation of the heat conduction and clearly demonstrates the necessity\nof hyperbolic models. The crossover wavelength decreases with increase of\naverage temperature. The decay patterns of the temperature field almost do not\ndepend on the amplitude of the perturbations, so the use of linear evolution\nequations for temperature field is justified. In all model investigated, the\nrelaxation of thermal perturbations is exponential -- contrary to linear chain,\nwhere it follows a power law. However, the most popular lowest-order hyperbolic\ngeneralization of the Fourier law, known as Cattaneo-Vernotte (CV) or telegraph\nequation (TE) is not valid for description of the observed behavior of the\nmodels with on-site potential. In part of the models a characteristic\nrelaxation times exhibit peculiar scaling with respect to the temperature\nperturbation wavelength. Quite surprisingly, such behavior is similar to that\nof well-known model with divergent heat conduction (Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain) and\nrather different from the model with normal heat conduction (chain of\nrotators). Thus, the data on the non-stationary heat conduction in the systems\nwith on-site potential do not fit commonly accepted concept of universality\nclasses for heat conduction in one-dimensional models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2011 06:56:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 10:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We assume the\nrelay's transmit symbol depends not only on its past received symbols but also\non its current received symbol, which is an appropriate model for studying\namplify-and-forward type relaying when the overall delay spread is much smaller\nthan the inverse of the bandwidth. For the discrete memoryless interference\nrelay-without-delay channel, we show an outer bound using genie-aided outer\nbounding. For the Gaussian interference relay-without-delay channel, we define\nstrong and very strong interference relay-without-delay channels and propose an\nachievable scheme based on instantaneous amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying. We\nalso propose two outer bounds for the strong and very strong cases. Using the\nproposed achievable scheme and outer bounds, we show that our scheme can\nachieve the capacity exactly when the relay's transmit power is greater than a\ncertain threshold. This is surprising since the conventional AF relaying is\nusually only asymptotically optimal, not exactly optimal.

All the known low ML decoding complexity techniques utilize the\nsame approach of exploiting either the multigroup decodable or the\nfast-decodable (conditionally multigroup decodable) structure of a code. We\nrefer to this well known technique of decoding STBCs as Conditional ML (CML)\ndecoding. In this paper we introduce a new framework to construct ML decoders\nfor STBCs based on the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) and the Factor-graph\nbased Sum-Product Algorithm. We say that an STBC is fast GDL decodable if the\norder of GDL decoding complexity of the code is strictly less than M^l, where l\nis the number of independent symbols in the STBC, and M is the constellation\nsize. We give sufficient conditions for an STBC to admit fast GDL decoding, and\nshow that both multigroup and conditionally multigroup decodable codes are fast\nGDL decodable. For any STBC, whether fast GDL decodable or not, we show that\nthe GDL decoding complexity is strictly less than the CML decoding complexity.\nFor instance, for any STBC obtained from Cyclic Division Algebras which is not\nmultigroup or conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL decoder provides\nabout 12 times reduction in complexity compared to the CML decoder. Similarly,\nfor the Golden code, which is conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL\ndecoder is only half as complex as the CML decoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2011 10:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 05:19:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 18:11:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 09:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The light curve exhibits a linear decline with a\nrelatively low peak absolute magnitude of only -15.9, and a low radioactive\ndecay luminosity at late times that suggests a nickel mass below 0.003\n$M_{\\odot}$. Spectra of SN2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peaked\nH$\\alpha$ line profile, showing: (1) a narrow (800 km/s) central component that\nsuggests shock interaction with dense CSM; (2) high-velocity blue and red\nemission features centered at -12600 and +15400 km/s; and (3) broad wings\nextending from -22000 to +25000 km/s. These features persist during 100 days\nafter explosion. We propose that this line profile indicates a bipolar\njet-driven explosion, with the central component produced by normal SN ejecta\nand CSM interaction at mid latitudes, while the high-velocity bumps and broad\nline wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar jet. Two variations of the jet\ninterpretation seem plausible: (1) A fast jet mixes 56Ni to high velocities in\npolar zones of the H-rich envelope, or (2) the reverse shock in the jet\nproduces blue and red bumps in Balmer lines when a jet interacts with dense\nCSM. Jet-driven SNeII are predicted for collapsars resulting from a wide range\nof initial masses above 25 $M_{\\odot}$ at sub-solar metallicity. This seems\nconsistent with the SN host environment, which is either an extremely\nlow-luminosity dwarf galaxy or very remote parts of an interacting pair of\nstar-forming galaxies. It also seems consistent with the low 56Ni mass that may\naccompany black hole formation. We speculate that the jet survives to produce\nobservable signatures because the star's H envelope was mostly stripped away by\nprevious eruptive mass loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2011 13:18:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Andrews et al. recently reported\nevidence for an IR excess in SN2010jl, indicating either new dust formation or\nthe heating of CSM dust in an IR echo. Here we report multi-epoch spectra of\nSN2010jl that reveal the tell-tale signature of new dust formation:\nemission-line profiles becoming systematically more blueshifted as the red side\nof the line is blocked by increasing extinction. The effect is seen clearly in\nthe intermediate-width (400--4000 km/s) component of H$\\alpha$ beginning\nroughly 30d after explosion. Moreover, we present near-IR spectra demonstrating\nthat the asymmetry in the hydrogen-line profiles is wavelength dependent,\nappearing more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. This evidence suggests that\nnew dust grains had formed quickly in the post-shock shell of SN 2010jl arising\nfrom CSM interaction. Since the observed dust temperature has been attributed\nto an IR echo and not to new dust, either (1) IR excess emission at $\\lambda <\n5 \\mu$m is not a particularly sensitive tracer of new dust formation in SNe, or\n(2) some assumptions about expected dust temperatures might require further\nstudy. Lastly, we discuss one possible mechanism other than dust that might\nlead to increasingly blueshifted line profiles in SNeIIn, although the\nwavelength dependence of the asymmetry argues against this hypothesis in the\ncase of SN2010jl.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2011 13:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In this paper, we\nextend these ideas to the case of equations with Lax pairs involving $3 \\times\n3$ matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2011 14:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 03:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Given the distance d of a dipole from a sphere surface of\nradius a, the representations comprise four elementary analytic functions and a\nmodified multipole series taking into account residual multipole contributions.\nThe analytic functions could be arranged hierarchically according to decreasing\nsingularity at the short distance limit d ---> 0, ranging from d^{-3} over\nd^{-1} to ln (d/a). The alternative representations exhibit drastically\nimproved convergence properties. On keeping mere residual dipole contribution\nof the modified multipole series, the representations agree with the converged\nrates on at least 99.9% for all distances, arbitrary particle sizes and\nemission wavelengths, and for a broad range of dielectric constants. The\nanalytic terms of the representations reveal a complex distance dependence and\ncould be used to interpolate between the familiar d^{-3} short-distance and\nd^{-6} long-distance behaviors with an unprecedented accuracy. Therefore, the\nrepresentations could be especially useful for the qualitative and quantitative\nunderstanding of the distance behavior of nonradiative rates of fluorophores\nand semiconductor quantum dots involving nanometal surface energy transfer in\nthe presence of metallic nanoparticles or nanoantennas. As a byproduct, a\ncomplete short-distance asymptotic of the quasistatic nonradiative rates is\nderived.
