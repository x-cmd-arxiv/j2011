In the present study, the compressible\nhydrodynamics and shock dynamics are studied for a two-dimensional hard-disk\nmedium at both the continuum and discrete particle level descriptions. For the\ncontinuum description, closed form analytical expressions for the inviscid\nhydrodynamic description, shock Hugoniot, isentropic exponent and shock jump\nconditions were obtained using the Helfand equation of state. The closed-form\nanalytical solutions permitted us to gain physical insight on the role of the\nmaterial's density on its compressibility, i.e. how the medium compresses under\nmechanical loadings and sustains wave motion. Furthermore, the predictions were\nfound in excellent agreement with calculations using the Event Driven Molecular\nDynamic method involving 30,000 particles over the entire range of\ncompressibility spanning the dilute ideal gas and liquid phases. In all cases,\nit was found that the energy imparted by the piston motion to the thermalized\nmedium behind the propagating shock was quasi-independent of the medium's\npacking fraction, with a correction vanishing with increasing shock Mach\nnumbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 16:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This model is based on\nlow-temperature electrical resistivity and magneto-resistance (MR)\nmeasurements. The conductivity at low temperatures showed a crossover from\nEfros-Shklovski (E-S) variable range hopping (VRH) to Mott VRH in 3 dimensions\n(3D) between the neighboring tubes as the iron weight percentage is increased\nfrom 11% to 19% in the MWNTs. The MR in the hopping regime is strongly\ndependent on temperature as well as magnetic field and shows both positive and\nnegative signs, which are discussed in terms of wave function shrinkage and\nquantum interference effects, respectively. A further increase of the iron\npercentage from 19% to 31% gives a conductivity crossover from Mott VRH to 3D\nweak localization (WL). This change is ascribed to the formation of long iron\nnanowires at the core of the nanotubes, which yields a long dephasing length\n(e.g. 30 nm) at the lowest measured temperature. Although the overall transport\nin this network is described by a 3D WL model, the weak temperature dependence\nof inelastic scattering length expressed as L_phi ~T^-0.3 suggests the\npossibility for the presence of one-dimensional channels in the network due to\nthe formation of long Fe nanowires inside the tubes, which might introduce an\nalignment in the random structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 16:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We develop a general multiscale theory for such\nsystems and apply it to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation as a case study. We\nfirst focus on a regime close to the instability onset (primary bifurcation),\nwhere the system can be described by a single dominant mode. We show\nanalytically that the resulting noise in the equation describing the amplitude\nof the dominant mode largely depends on the nature of the stochastic forcing.\nFor a highly degenerate noise, in the sense that it is acting on the first\nstable mode only, the amplitude equation is dominated by a pure multiplicative\nnoise, which in turn induces the dominant mode to undergo several critical\nstate transitions and complex phenomena, including intermittency and\nstabilisation, as the noise strength is increased. The intermittent behaviour\nis characterised by a power-law probability density and the corresponding\ncritical exponent is calculated rigorously by making use of the first-passage\nproperties of the amplitude equation. On the other hand, when the noise is\nacting on the whole subspace of stable modes, the multiplicative noise is\ncorrected by an additive-like term, with the eventual loss of any stabilised\nstate. We also show that the stochastic forcing has no effect on the dominant\nmode dynamics when it is acting on the second stable mode. Finally, in a regime\nwhich is relatively far from the instability onset, so that there are two\nunstable modes, we observe numerically that when the noise is acting on the\nfirst stable mode, both dominant modes show noise-induced complex phenomena\nsimilar to the single-mode case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 16:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 12:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-20"}

However, baryonic physics\nmay affect the dark matter density profile. For example, it was suggested that\nadiabatic contraction of baryonic gas makes the dark matter cusp steeper.\nHowever, it is still an open question if the gas falls into the galactic centre\nin smooth adiabatic manner. Recent numerical studies suggested that disc\ngalaxies might experience clumpy phase in their early stage of the disc\nformation, which could also explain clump clusters and chain galaxies observed\nin high redshift Universe. In this letter, using numerical simulations with an\nisolated model, we study how the dark matter halo responds to these clumpy\nnature of baryon component in disc galaxy formation through the clump cluster\nphase. Our simulation demonstrates that such clumpy phase leads to a shallower\ndensity profile of the dark matter halo in the central region while clumps fall\ninto the centre due to dynamical friction. This mechanism helps to make the\ncentral dark matter density profile shallower in the galaxies whose virial mass\nis as large as 5.0*10^11 solar masses. This phenomenon is caused by reaction to\ndynamical friction of the stellar clumps against the dark matter halo. The halo\ndraws the clumps into the galactic centre, while kinematically heated by the\nclumps. We additionally run a dark matter only simulation excluding baryonic\ncomponent and confirm that the resultant shallower density profile is not due\nto numerical artifact in the simulation, such as two-body relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 17:48:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 14:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In the presence of a random\nnoise, the ball exhibits a stochastic rolling with a net drift, the velocity of\nwhich increases non-linearly with the strength of the noise (K). From the\nevolution of the displacement distribution, it is evident that the rolling is\ncontrolled by a Coulomb like friction at a very low velocity, a super-linear\nfriction at an intermediate velocity and a linear kinematic friction at a large\nvelocity. This transition from a non-linear to a linear friction control of\nmotion can be discerned from another experiment in which the ball is subjected\nto a small amplitude periodic asymmetric vibration in conjunction with a random\nnoise. Here, as opposed to that of a fixed external force, the rolling velocity\ndecreases with the increase of the strength of the noise suggesting a\nprogressive fluidization of the interface.

We show that this delay is a natural consequence of a\nmagnetic dominated relativistic jet. The much slower acceleration of a magnetic\njet with radius (compared with a hot baryonic outflow) results in high energy\ngamma-ray photons to be converted to electron-positron pairs out to a larger\nradius whereas lower energy gamma-rays of energy less than ~10 MeV can escape\nwhen the jet crosses the Thomson-photosphere. The resulting delay for the\narrival of high energy photons is found to be similar to the value observed by\nthe Fermi satellite for a number of GRBs. A prediction of this model is that\nthe delay should increase with photon energy (E) as E^{0.17} for E>100 MeV. The\ndelay depends almost linearly on burst redshift, and on the distance from the\ncentral compact object where the jet is launched (R_0). Therefore, the delay in\narrival of >10^2 MeV photons can be used to estimate burst redshift if the\nmagnetic jet model for gamma-ray generation is correct and R_0 is roughly the\nsame for long-GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Such starburst\ngalaxies are rare but have much higher SFRs, and it is of interest to establish\nthe relative importance of these two modes. PACS/Herschel observations over the\nwhole COSMOS and GOODS-South fields, in conjunction with previous\noptical/near-IR data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first time\nthe relative contribution of the two modes to the global SFR density in the\nredshift interval 1.5<z<2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formation\nactivity. The logarithmic distributions of galaxy SFRs at fixed stellar mass\nare well described by Gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only a\nrelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for SFRs more than 4 times\nhigher than on the main sequence. Such starburst galaxies represent only 2% of\nmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic SFR\ndensity at z~2. Only when limited to SFR>1000M(sun)/yr, off-sequence sources\nsignificantly contribute to the SFR density (46+/-20%). We conclude that\nmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation of\nstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards the\nquenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The integration is robust throughout those epochs: the SFR data\nunderpinning our calculations is consistent with the evolution of stellar mass\ndensity in this regime. Analytic approximations to these SFHs are provided.\nIntegration-based results reaffirm previous suggestions that current\nstar-forming galaxies formed virtually all of their stellar mass at z<2. It\nfollows that massive galaxies observed at z>2 are not the typical progenitors\nof star-forming galaxies today.\n  We also check MSI-based SFHs against those inferred from analysis of the\nfossil record -- from spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming\ngalaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and color magnitude diagrams (CMDs)\nof resolved stars in dwarf irregular galaxies. Once stellar population age\nuncertainties are accounted for, the main sequence is in excellent agreement\nwith SED-based SFHs (from VESPA). Extrapolating SFR main sequence observations\nto dwarf galaxies, we find differences between MSI results and SFHs from CMD\nanalysis of ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury and Local Group galaxies.\nResolved dwarfs appear to grow much slower than main sequence trends imply, and\nalso slower than slightly higher mass SED-analyzed galaxies. This difference\nmay signal problems with SFH determinations, but it may also signal a shift in\nstar formation trends at the lowest stellar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 20:03:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2011 19:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-17"}

While the problem is still NP-hard, we show that a (depth-first)\ntree-search algorithm with memory O(N) ($N$ is the network size) can be\ndeveloped, and for practical setups, the search complexity and speed is very\nmanageable, and is magnitudes less than the conventional problem, especially\nwhen the graph is sparse or when only very limited anchor nodes are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 01:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-05"}

Comparison with the CO rotational lines measures gives\nthe same combination of constants obtained from the comparison fine structure\nline of singly ionised carbon, [CII]. However, neutral carbon has the distinct\nadvantage that it may be spatially coincident with the carbon monoxide, whereas\n[CII] could be located in the diffuse medium between molecular clouds, and so\nany comparison with CO could be dominated by intrinsic velocity differences.\nUsing [CI], we obtain a mean variation of dF/F = (-3.6 +/- 8.5) x 10^-5, over z\n= 2.3 - 4.1, for the eight [CI] systems, which degrades to (-1.5+/- 11) x\n10^-5, over z = 2.3 - 6.4 when the two [CII] systems are included. That is,\nzero variation over look-back times of 10.8-12.8 Gyr. However, the latest\noptical results indicate a spatial variation in alpha, which describes a dipole\nand we see the same direction in dF/F. This trend is, however, due to a single\nsource for which the [CI] spectrum is of poor quality. This also applies to one\nof the two [CII] spectra previously used to find a zero variation in\nalpha^2/mu. Quantifying this, we find an anti-correlation between |dF/F| and\nthe quality of the carbon detection, as measured by the spectral resolution,\nindicating that the typical values of >50 km/s, used to obtain a detection, are\ntoo coarse to reliably measure changes in the constants. From the fluxes of the\nknown z > 1 CO systems, we predict that current instruments are incapable of\nthe sensitivities required to measure changes in the constants through the\ncomparison of CO and carbon lines.

The study of solution approaches to the\nprobabilistic SINR constrained problem is important because CSI errors are\noften present in practical systems and they may cause substantial SINR outages\nif not handled properly.

From the dual string theory perspective where the\nlarge-spin operator is identified with the Gubser-Klebanov-Polyakov (GKP)\nstring, our approach is equivalent to constructing the first Luescher\ncorrection to the energy of the GKP string by incorporating the contribution of\nvirtual excitations propagating on it. It allows us to propose a formula that\ncontrols a particular class of large-spin corrections to the twist-two\nanomalous dimension and holds at any value of the coupling constant. Compared\nto wrapping corrections computed with magnons propagating on the spin chain,\nthe finite-size corrections that are encoded in our formalism start at a lower\nloop level. Our formalism thus calls for modification of the asymptotic\ncontributions which are conventionally incorporated within the Asymptotic Bethe\nAnsatz. An educated guess allows us to remedy this pitfall and successfully\nconfront our predictions with known results up to five loop accuracy at weak\ncoupling. Finally, our formula sheds light on the weak-to-strong coupling\ntransition for the subleading large-spin corrections under study and confirms\nstringy expectations at strong coupling where they are found to be identical to\nthe first Luescher correction to the vacuum energy of the O(6) sigma model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 06:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We present a study of the distribution of stellar ages in the Orion\nNebula Cluster (ONC) based on accurate HST photometry taken from the HST\nTreasury Program observations of the ONC utilizing the most recent estimate of\nthe cluster's distance (Menten et al. 2007). We investigate the presence of an\nintrinsic age spread in the region and a possible trend of age with the spatial\ndistribution. Methods. We estimate the extinction and accretion luminosity\ntowards each source by performing synthetic photometry on an empirical\ncalibration of atmospheric models (Da Rio et al. 2010) using the package\nChorizos (Maiz-Apellaniz 2004). The position of the sources in the HR-diagram\nis compared with different theoretical isochrones to estimate the mean cluster\nage and age dispersion.

Results. According to Siess et al. (2000) evolutionary\nmodels the mean age of the Cluster is 2.2 Myr with a scatter of few Myrs. With\nMonte Carlo simulations we find that the observed age spread is inconsistent\nwith a coeval stellar population, but is in agreement with a star formation\nactivity between 1.5 and 3.5 Myrs.

One argument is\nthat the BL Lac objects show bluer-when-brighter chromatism while the\nflat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) display redder-when-brighter trend. Base on\na 3.5-year three-colour monitoring programme, we studied the optical\nvariability and colour behaviour of one FSRQ, 3C 345. There is at least one\noutburst in this period. The overall variation amplitude is 2.640 mags in the\n$i$ band. Intra-night variability was observed on two nights. The\nbluer-when-brighter and redder-when-brighter chromatisms were simultaneously\nobserved in this object when using different pairs of passbands to compute the\ncolours. The bluer-when-brighter chromatism is a shared property with the BL\nLacs, while the redder-when-brighter trend is likely due to two less variable\nemission features, the Mg\\,{\\sc ii} line and the blue bump, at short\nwavelengths. With numerical simulations, we show that some other strong but\nless variable emission lines in the spectrum of FSRQs may also significantly\nalter their colour behaviour. Then the colour behaviour of an FSRQ is linked\nnot only to the emission process in the relativistic jet, but also to the\nredshift, the passbands used for computing the colour and the strengths of the\nless variable emission features relative to the strength of the non-thermal\ncontinuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 08:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

A streamer can supply these electrons by itself through\nphoto-ionization, or the electrons can be present due to external background\nionization. Here we investigate the effects of background ionization on\nstreamer propagation and morphology by changing the gas composition and the\nrepetition rate of the voltage pulses, and by adding a small amount of\nradioactive Krypton 85.\n  We find that the general morphology of a positive streamer discharge in high\npurity nitrogen depends on background ionization: at lower background\nionization levels the streamers branch more and have a more feather-like\nappearance. This is observed both when varying the repetition rate and when\nadding Krypton 85, though side branches are longer with the radioactive\nadmixture. But velocities and minimal diameters of streamers are virtually\nindependent of the background ionization level. In air, the inception cloud\nbreaks up into streamers at a smaller radius when the repetition rate and\ntherefore the background ionization level is higher. When measuring the effects\nof the pulse repetition rate and of the radioactive admixture on the discharge\nmorphology, we found that our estimates of background ionization levels are\nconsistent with these observations; this gives confidence in the estimates.\n  Streamer channels generally do not follow the paths of previous discharge\nchannels for repetition rates of up to 10 Hz.

Proposed explanations for this darkness are: i) the GRB is at high\nredshift ii) dust in the GRB host galaxy absorbs the optical/NIR flux iii) GRBs\nhave an intrinsically faint afterglow emission. Within this framework, GRB\n100614A and GRB 100615A are extreme. In fact, they are bright in the X-rays,\nbut no optical/NIR afterglow has been detected for either source, despite\nseveral follow-up campaigns began early after the triggers. We build\noptical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the times at which the\nreddest upper limits are available, and we model our SEDs with the extinction\ncurves of the Milky Way (MW), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the attenuation\ncurve obtained for a sample of starburst galaxies. We find that to explain the\ndeepest NIR upper limits assuming either a MW or SMC extinction law, a visual\nextinction of AV > 50 is required, which is extremely unlikely. Since both GRBs\nare bright in X-rays, explanation iii) also cannot explain their dark\nclassification, unless optical radiation and X-rays are not part of the same\nsynchrotron spectrum. An alternative, or complementary explanation of the\nprevious possibility, involves greyer extinction laws. A starburst attenuation\ncurve gives AV>10, which is less extreme, despite still very high. Assuming\nhigh redshift in addition to extinction, implies an AV>10 at z=2 and AV>4-5 at\nz=5, regardless of the adopted extinction recipe. A different, exotic\npossibility would be an extremely high redshift origin (z>17 given the missing\nK detections). Population III stars are expected to emerge at z ~ 20 and can\nproduce GRBs with energies well above those inferred for our GRBs at these\nredshifts.

However, at z~2 the limited\nsignal to noise ratio and spatial resolution of the data usually do not allow\nspatially resolved kinematical modeling and very often only virial masses can\nbe estimated from line widths. But even such estimates require a good knowledge\nof galaxy size, which may be smaller than the spatial resolution.\nSpectroastrometry is a technique which combines spatial and spectral resolution\nto probe spatial scales significantly smaller than the spatial resolution of\nthe observations. Here we apply it to the case of high-z galaxies and present a\nmethod based on spectroastrometry to estimate dynamical masses of high z\ngalaxies, which overcomes the problem of size determination with poor spatial\nresolution. We construct and calibrate a \"spectroastrometric\" virial mass\nestimator, modifying the \"classical\" virial mass formula.

The spectroastrometric estimator is found to be a good approximation\nof dynamical masses, presenting a linear relation with a residual dispersion of\nonly 0.15 dex. This is a big improvement compared to the \"classical\" virial\nmass estimator which has a non linear relation and much larger dispersion (0.47\ndex) compared to dynamical masses. By applying our calibrated estimator to 16\ngalaxies from the AMAZE and LSD samples, we obtain masses in the ~10^7-10^10\nM\\odot range extending the mass range attainable with dynamical modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 12:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-14"}

Correlation and a principal\ncomponent analysis were performed in order to detect any collective behavior of\nthe social ensemble of fans. Results showed that fans behaved as a system\nsubject to a phase transition where the neutral state in the opinion, emotional\nand action space has been destabilized and a new stable state of coherent\nattitudes was formed. The enhancement of fluctuations and the increase of\nsocial susceptibility (responsiveness) to referee's decisions were connected to\nthe first few decisions. The subsequent reduction of values in these parameters\nsignified the onset of coherent layering within the attitude space of the\nsocial ensemble of fans.

Within this framework, GRB\n100614A and GRB 100615A are extreme. In fact, they are bright in the X-rays,\nbut no optical/NIR afterglow has been detected for either source, despite\nseveral follow-up campaigns began early after the triggers. We build\noptical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the times at which the\nreddest upper limits are available, and we model our SEDs with the extinction\ncurves of the Milky Way (MW), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the attenuation\ncurve obtained for a sample of starburst galaxies. We find that to explain the\ndeepest NIR upper limits assuming either a MW or SMC extinction law, a visual\nextinction of AV > 50 is required, which is extremely unlikely. Since both GRBs\nare bright in X-rays, explanation iii) also cannot explain their dark\nclassification, unless optical radiation and X-rays are not part of the same\nsynchrotron spectrum. An alternative, or complementary explanation of the\nprevious possibility, involves greyer extinction laws. A starburst attenuation\ncurve gives AV>10, which is less extreme, despite still very high. Assuming\nhigh redshift in addition to extinction, implies an AV>10 at z=2 and AV>4-5 at\nz=5, regardless of the adopted extinction recipe. A different, exotic\npossibility would be an extremely high redshift origin (z>17 given the missing\nK detections). Population III stars are expected to emerge at z ~ 20 and can\nproduce GRBs with energies well above those inferred for our GRBs at these\nredshifts.

It is the first in a series of papers working towards\nconstructing a realistic 3D non-potential model for the interaction of\nsmall-scale solar magnetic fields. In the model, the basic evolution of the\nmagnetic elements is governed by a supergranular flow profile. In addition,\nmagnetic elements may evolve through the processes of emergence, cancellation,\ncoalescence and fragmentation. Model parameters for the emergence of bipoles\nare based upon the results of observational studies. Using this model, several\nsimulations are considered, where the range of flux with which bipoles may\nemerge is varied. In all cases the model quickly reaches a steady state where\nthe rates of emergence and cancellation balance. Analysis of the resulting\nmagnetic field shows that we reproduce observed quantities such as the flux\ndistribution, mean field, cancellation rates, photospheric recycle time and a\nmagnetic network.

UVES high resolution spectroscopy of GRB 081008 was\nsecured ~5 hr after the Swift trigger. Our dataset comprises also three FORS2\nnearly simultaneous spectra of the same source. The availability of nearly\nsimultaneous high and low resolution spectra for a GRB afterglow is an\nextremely rare event. The GRB-Damped Lyman Alpha system at z = 1.9683 shows\nthat the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy is constituted by at\nleast three components which contribute to the line profiles. Component I is\nthe redmost one, and is 20 km/s and 78 km/s redward component II and III,\nrespectively. We detect several ground state and excited absorption features in\ncomponents I and II. These features have been used to compute the distances\nbetween the GRB and the absorbers. Component I is found to be 52 +/- 6 pc away\nfrom the GRB, while component II presents few excited transitions and its\ndistance is 200+60-80} pc. The hydrogen column density associated to GRB 081008\nis log NH/cm^-2 = 21.11 +/- 0.10, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in\nthe range [X/H] = -1.29 to -0.52.

Any method relying on the spent electron\nbeam downstream of the baseline undulator should provide a way of transporting\nthe radiation up to the experimental floor.

In this way the THz output must propagate with limited size\nat least for one hundred meters in a maze, following many turns, to reach the\nnear experimental hall. The use of a standard, discrete, open beam-waveguide\nformed by periodic reflectors, that is a mirror guide, would lead to\nunacceptable size of the system. To avoid these problems, in this paper we\npropose an alternative approach based on periodically spaced metallic screens\nwith holes.

The proposed\nsetup takes almost no cost nor time to be implemented at the LCLS baseline, and\ncan be used at other facilities as well. The edge radiation source is limited\nin maximally achievable field strength at the sample. An extension based on the\nuse of an undulator in the presence of the iris line, which is feasible at the\nLCLS energies, is proposed as a possible upgrade of the baseline THz source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 13:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-05"}

We instead use the\nX-ray data from 0.3-40 keV to identify the source as a bright intermediate\npolar (IP) with an estimate for the white dwarf mass of~0.60 M_solar. This\nidentification is supported by the presence of an iron triplet, the component\nlines of which are some of the strongest seen in IPs; and the signature of the\nspin period of the white dwarf at ~24 mins. We note that the lack of broad-band\nvariability may suggest that this object is a stream-fed IP, similar in many\nrespects to the well studied IP, V2400 Oph. Phase-binning has allowed us to\ncreate spectra corresponding to the peaks and troughs of the lightcurve from\nwhich we determine that the spectra appear harder in the troughs, consistent\nwith the behaviour of other IPs binned on their spin periods.

Our unique data set has allowed us to demonstrate\nthat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biases\nthat cannot be ignored. Almost all the BL Lac objects have been detected by\nFermi-LAT, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) in the\nradio, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray selected samples are still below the\ngamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of Fermi-LAT data.\nThe radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70GHz, above\nwhich it steepens to <\\alpha>~-0.65. BL Lacs have significantly flatter spectra\nthan FSRQs at higher frequencies. The distribution of the rest-frame\nsynchrotron peak frequency (\\nupS) in the SED of FSRQs is the same in all the\nblazar samples with <\\nupS>=10^13.1 Hz, while the mean inverse-Compton peak\nfrequency, <\\nupIC>, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 Hz. The distributions of \\nupS\nand of \\nupIC of BL Lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energies\nthan those of FSRQs and strongly depend on the selection method. The Compton\ndominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only FSRQs reaching values\n>3. Its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,\nwith gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selected\nblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar power\nis dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. Simple SSC models\ncannot explain the SEDs of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in all\nsamples. The SED of the blazars that were not detected by Fermi-LAT may instead\nbe consistent with SSC emission.

SAFs are complex power\nelectronics equipments adopted to compensate for cur-rent harmonic pollution in\nelectric mains, due to nonlinear loads. By using a proper \"floating\" capacitor\nas energy reservoir, the SAF purpose is to inject in the line grid currents\ncanceling the polluting har-monics. Control algorithms play a key role for such\ndevices and, in general, in many power electronics applications. Moreover,\nsystems theory is crucial, since it is the mathematical tool that enables a\ndeep understanding of the involved dynamics of such systems, allowing a correct\ndimensioning, beside an effective control. As a matter of facts, current\ninjection objective can be straightforwardly formulated as an output tracking\ncontrol problem. In this fashion, the structural and insidious\nmarginally-stable internal/zero dynamics of SAFs can be immediately highlighted\nand characterized in terms of sizing and control issues. For what concerns the\ncontrol design strictly, time-scale separation among output and internal\ndynamics can be effectively exploited to split the control design in different\nstages that can be later aggregated, by using singular perturbation analysis.\nIn addition, for robust asymptotic output tracking the Internal Model Principle\nis adopted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 15:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-08"}
