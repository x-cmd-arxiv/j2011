RU Peg contains a massive\nwhite dwarf, possibly the hottest white dwarf in a dwarf nova, it has a low\ninclination, thus optimally exposing its X-ray emitting boundary layer, and has\nan excellent trigonometric parallax distance. We modeled the X-ray data using\nXSPEC assuming a multi-temperature plasma emission model built from the MEKAL\ncode. We obtained a maximum temperature of 31.7 keV, based on the EPIC MOS1, 2\nand pn data, indicating that RU Peg has an X-ray spectrum harder than most\ndwarf novae, except U Gem. This result is consistent with and indirectly\nconfirms the large mass of the white dwarf in RU Peg. The X-ray luminosity we\ncomputed corresponds to a boundary layer luminosity for a mass accretion rate\nof 2.E-11 Msun/yr (assuming Mwd=1.3Msun), in agreement with an expected\nquiescent accretion rate. The modeling of the O VIII emission line at 19A as\nobserved by the RGS implies a projected stellar rotational velocity of 695\nkm/s, i.e. the line is emitted from material rotating at about 936-1245 km/s\n(for i about 34-48deg) or about 1/6 of the Keplerian speed; this velocity is\nmuch larger than the rotation speed of the white dwarf inferred from the FUSE\nspectrum. Cross-correlation analysis yielded an undelayed component and a\ndelayed component of 116 +/- 17 sec where the X-ray variations/fluctuations\nlagged the UV variations. This indicates that the UV fluctuations in the inner\ndisk are propagated into the X-ray emitting region in about 116 sec.

It has previously been demonstrated that\nat certain critical field parameters, the semiclassical trajectories of\nelectrons in the lowest miniband of the superlattice change abruptly from fully\nlocalised to completely unbounded. The unbounded electron orbits propagate\nthrough intricate web patterns, known as stochastic webs, in phase space, which\nact as conduction channels for the electrons and produce a series of resonant\npeaks in the electron drift velocity versus electric field curves. Here, we\nshow that increasing the lattice temperature strengthens these resonant peaks\ndue to a subtle interplay between thermal population of the conduction channels\nand transport along them. This enhances both the electron drift velocity and\nthe influence of the stochastic webs on the current-voltage characteristics,\nwhich we calculate by making self-consistent solutions of the coupled electron\ntransport and Poisson equations throughout the superlattice. These solutions\nreveal that increasing the temperature also transforms the collective electron\ndynamics by changing both the threshold voltage required for the onset of\nself-sustained current oscillations, produced by propagating charge domains,\nand the oscillation frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 17:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Exploring such quantum-classical correspondences in a more\ntransparent manner is central to the deeper understanding of foundational\naspects and has attracted a great deal of attention - starting from the early\ndays of quantum theory. While it is often highlighted that quantum to classical\ntransition occurs in the limit hbar tending to zero, several objections have\nbeen raised about its suitability in some physical contexts. Ehrenfest's\ntheorem is another widely discussed classical limit - however, its inadequacy\nhas also been pointed out in specific examples. It has been proposed that since\na quantum mechanical wave function inherits an intrinsic statistical behavior,\nits classical limit must correspond to a classical ensemble - not an individual\nparticle. This opens up the question \"how would uncertainty relations of\ncanonical observables compare themselves in quantum and classical realms?\" In\nthis paper we explore parallels between uncertainty relations in stationary\nstates of quantum systems and that in the corresponding classical ensemble. We\nconfine ourselves to one dimensional conservative systems and show, with the\nhelp of suitably defined dimensionless physical quantities, that first and\nsecond moments of the canonical observables match with each other in classical\nand quantum descriptions - resulting in an identical structure for uncertainty\nrelations in both the realms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 18:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-17"}

The effective dielectric constant of the\nsolvated protein, representing the average dipole moment induced at the protein\nby a uniform external field, shows a remarkable variation among the proteins\nstudied by numerical simulations. It changes from 0.5 for ubiquitin to 640 for\ncytochrome c. The former value implies a negative dipolar susceptibility of\nubiquitin, that is a dia-electric dipolar response and negative\ndielectrophoresis. It means that a protein carrying an average dipole of ~240 D\nis expected to repel from the region of a stronger electric field. This outcome\nis the result of a negative cross-correlation between the protein and water\ndipoles, compensating for the positive variance of the protein dipole in the\noverall dipolar susceptibility. This phenomenon can be characterized as\noverscreening of protein's dipole by the hydration shell. In contrast to the\nneutral ubiquitin, charged proteins studied here show para-electric dipolar\nresponse and positive dielectrophoresis. The protein-water dipolar\ncross-correlations are long-ranged, extending approximately 2 nm from the\nprotein surface into the bulk. The analysis of numerical simulations suggests\nthat the polarization of the protein-water interface is strongly affected by\nthe distribution of the protein surface charge. This component of the protein\ndipolar response gains in importance for high frequencies, above the protein\nDebye peak, when the response of the protein dipole becomes dynamically\narrested. The interface response found in simulations suggests a possibility of\na positive increment of the high-frequency dielectric constant of the solution\ncompared to the dielectric constant of the solvent, in support of the observed\nTHz absorbance of protein solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 20:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We propose a novel modification for BitTorrent that\nwe call the BitTorrent Anonymity Marketplace. Peers in our system trade in k\nswarms obscuring the actual intent of the participants.

For giants with deep convective envelopes, the canonical\ndescription holds that once mass transfer begins it typically proceeds\ncatastrophically on the dynamical timescale, as the star cannot lose sufficient\nheat in order to avoid expansion. However, we demonstrate that the local\nthermal timescale of the envelope's superadiabatic outer surface layer remains\ncomparable to that of mass loss in most cases of \"dynamical\" mass loss. We\nargue therefore that if mass loss proceeds on a timescale longer than this,\nthen even a deep convective envelope will not dramatically expand, as the\nsurface layer will have time to relax thermally and reconstitute itself. We\ndemonstrate that in general the polytropic approximation gives much too strict\na criterion for stability, and discuss the dependence of the donor's response\non its radius in addition to its core mass. In general, we find that the\neffective response of the donor on rapid timescales cannot be determined\naccurately without detailed evolutionary calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2011 02:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

For ternary nitrides\nAlxGa(1-x)N, InxGa(1-x)N and InxAl(1-x)N, the phonon group velocities have been\ncalculated as a functions of composition. A small positive bowing is observed\nin phonon group velocities of ternary alloys. Percent variations in phonon\ngroup velocities are also calculated for a straightforward comparison among\nternary nitrides. The results are expected to show a change in phonon\nrelaxation rates and thermal conductivity of III-nitrides when piezoelectric\npolarization property is taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2011 07:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 08:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

We demonstrate that these gauge structures are closely\nrelated, and appear as counterparts in either the canonical or\nfield-theoretical language.

A growing\nnumber of programming languages from commercial and academic spheres have been\ngiven usable semantic descriptions by means of structural operational\nsemantics. Because of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural\noperational semantics has found considerable application in the study of the\nsemantics of concurrent processes. It is also a viable alternative to\ndenotational semantics in the static analysis of programs, and in proving\ncompiler correctness. Moreover, it has found application in emerging areas of\ncomputing such as probabilistic systems and systems biology.\n  Structural operational semantics has been successfully applied as a formal\ntool to establish results that hold for classes of process description\nlanguages. This has allowed for the generalization of well-known results in the\nfield of process algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process\ncalculi based on the realization that many of the results in this field only\ndepend upon general semantic properties of language constructs.\n  The workshop is a forum for researchers, students and practitioners\ninterested in new developments and directions for future investigations.
