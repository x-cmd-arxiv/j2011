As discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) can evaluate a polynomial at\nmultiple points, efficient DFT algorithms are promising in reducing the\ncomputational complexities of syndrome based decoders for long RS codes. In\nthis paper, we first propose partial composite cyclotomic Fourier transforms\n(CCFTs) and then devise syndrome based decoders for long RS codes over large\nfinite fields based on partial CCFTs. The new decoders based on partial CCFTs\nachieve a significant saving of computational complexities for long RS codes.\nSince partial CCFTs have modular and regular structures, the new decoders are\nsuitable for hardware implementations. To further verify and demonstrate the\nadvantages of partial CCFTs, we implement in hardware the syndrome computation\nblock for a $(2720, 2550)$ shortened RS code over GF$(2^{12})$. In comparison\nto previous results based on Horner's rule, our hardware implementation not\nonly has a smaller gate count, but also achieves much higher throughputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2011 17:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We employ the\nsame method to classify the continuous 2D defects of a vacuum in a 4D maximally\nsymmetric spacetime. These so-called \\textit{cosmic forms} fall into three\nclasses: i)- $m$-forms, akin to 3D space disclinations, related to ordinary\nrotations, analogous to Kibble's global cosmic strings (except that being\ncontinuous any deficit angle is allowed); ii)- $t$-forms, related to Lorentz\nboosts (hyperbolic rotations); iii)- $r$-forms, never considered so far,\nrelated to null rotations. A detailed account of their metrics is presented. In\neach class, one distinguishes between wedge forms, whose singularities occupy a\n2D world sheet, and twist or mixed forms, whose inner structure appears as a\nnon-singular \\textit{core} separated from the outer part by a 3D world shell\nwith distributional curvature and/or torsion. Relaxation processes of the world\nshell involve new types of topological interactions between cosmic dislocations\nand cosmic disclinations. The resulting structures of the core region itself\nare not explored in this article. Whereas $m$-forms are \\textit{compatible}\nwith the usual cosmological principle (CP) of space homogeneity and isotropy,\n$t$- and $r$-forms demand spacetime homogeneity. Thus we advance that $t$- and\n$r$-forms are typical of a primeval false vacuum obeying the perfect CP in a de\nSitter spacetime. Cosmic forms may assemble into networks with conservation\nlaws at their nodes, such that all the segments are made of \\textit{positive}\nforms, say, thus generating some characteristic curvature field. To this\nnetwork may be adjunct a conjugated network made of \\textit{negative} forms, in\norder to tune the final spatial curvature to a given value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2011 20:57:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 19:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-29"}

The effective Hamitonian is the analogue to the first graphene\nquantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) Hamiltonian.

Therefore, silicene as well as low-buckled\ncounterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn has much larger\ngap opened by effective SOC at Dirac points than graphene due to low-buckled\ngeometry and larger atomic intrinsic SOC strength. Further, the more buckled is\nthe structure, the greater is the gap. Therefore, QSHE can be observed in\nlow-buckled Si, Ge, and Sn systems in an experimentally accessible temperature\nregime.

Assuming a constant scale height (h_z, calculated via an\nempirical oblateness relation), we calculate dynamical disk mass surface\ndensities from stellar kinematics, which provide vertical velocity dispersions\nafter correcting for the shape of the stellar velocity ellipsoid (measured to\nhave sigma_theta/sigma_R=1.04 +/- 0.22 and sigma_z/sigma_R=0.48 +/- 0.09).

In the outer layers of a stellar\natmosphere the anisotropy of the radiation field is typically dominated by the\nradiation escaping away, but local horizontal fluctuations of the physical\nconditions may also contribute, distorting the illumination and hence, the\npolarization pattern. Additionally, a magnetic field may perturb and modify the\nline scattering polarization signals through the Hanle effect. Here, we study\nsuch symmetry-breaking effects. We develop a method to solve the transfer of\npolarized radiation in a scattering atmosphere with weak horizontal\nfluctuations of the opacity and source functions. It comprises linearization\n(small opacity fluctuations are assumed), reduction to a quasi-planeparallel\nproblem through harmonic analysis, and numerical solution by generalized\nstandard techniques. We apply this method to study scattering polarization in\natmospheres with horizontal fluctuations in the Planck function and opacity. We\nderive several very general results and constraints from considerations on the\nsymmetries and dimensionality of the problem, and we give explicit solutions of\na few illustrative problems of especial interest. For example, we show (a) how\nthe amplitudes of the fractional linear polarization signals change when\nconsidering increasingly smaller horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities, (b)\nthat in the presence of such inhomogeneities even a vertical magnetic field may\nmodify the scattering line polarization, and (c) that forward scattering\npolarization may be produced without the need of an inclined magnetic field.\nThese results are important to understand the physics of the problem and as\nbenchmarks for multidimensional radiative transfer codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2011 09:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

As the\ntemperature T varies from T = 150 K to T = 165 K, the Gd3+ ESR fine and\nhyperfine structures coalesce into a broad inhomogeneous single resonance. At T\n= 200 K the line narrows and as T increases further, the resonance becomes\nhomogeneous with a thermal broadening of 1.1(2) Oe/K. These results suggest\nthat the origin of these features may be associated to a subtle interdependence\nof thermally activated mechanisms that combine: i) an increase with T of the\ndensity of activated conduction-carriers across the T-dependent semiconducting\npseudogap; ii) the Gd3+ Korringa relaxation process due to an exchange\ninteraction, J_{fd}S.s, between the Gd3+ localized magnetic moments and the\nthermally activated conduction-carriers and; iii) a relatively weak confining\npotential of the rare-earth ions inside the oversized (Fe2P3)4 cage, which\nallows the rare-earths to become rattler Einstein oscillators above T = 148 K.\nWe argue that the rattling of the Gd3+ ions, via a motional narrowing\nmechanism, also contributes to the coalescence of the ESR fine and hyperfine\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2011 14:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

These kinds of\nmodels allow studying aspects of operational management but are not well suited\nfor studying the dynamics that appear in service systems due to human\nbehaviour. For these kinds of studies we require tools that allow modelling the\nsystem and entities using an object-oriented world view, where intelligent\nobjects serve as abstract \"actors\" that are goal directed and can behave\nproactively. In our work we combine process-oriented discrete event simulation\nmodelling and object-oriented agent based simulation modelling to investigate\nthe impact of people management practices on retail productivity. In this\npaper, we reveal in a series of experiments what impact considering proactivity\ncan have on the output accuracy of simulation models of human centric systems.\nThe model and data we use for this investigation are based on a case study in a\nUK department store.

A larger weight loss of up\nto 0.5% was seen over a disc spun at 5000 rpm. The effect has so far been\nobserved in only one laboratory. Here, a new model for inertia that assumes\nthat inertial mass is caused by Unruh radiation which is subject to a\nHubble-scale Casimir effect (called MiHsC or quantised inertia) is applied to\nthis anomaly. When the disc is exposed to the AC magnetic field it vibrates\n(accelerates), and MiHsC then predicts that the inertial mass of the nearby\ntest mass increases, so that to conserve momentum it must accelerate upwards\nagainst freefall by 0.0029 m/s^2 or 0.03% of g, about half of the weight loss\nobserved. With disc rotation, MiHsC predicts an additional weight loss, but 28\ntimes smaller than the rotational effect observed. MiHsC suggests that the\neffect should increase with disc radius and rotation rate, the AC magnetic\nfield strength (as observed), and also with increasing latitude and for lighter\ndiscs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2011 14:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-18"}
