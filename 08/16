Their form is such that modular reduction is extremely efficient,\nthus making them an attractive choice for modular multiplication\nimplementation. However, the issue of residue multiplication efficiency seems\nto have been overlooked. Asymptotically, using a cyclic rather than a linear\nconvolution, residue multiplication modulo a Mersenne number is twice as fast\nas integer multiplication; this property does not hold for prime GMNs, unless\nthey are of Mersenne's form. In this work we exploit an alternative\ngeneralisation of Mersenne numbers for which an analogue of the above property\n--- and hence the same efficiency ratio --- holds, even at bitlengths for which\nschoolbook multiplication is optimal, while also maintaining very efficient\nreduction. Moreover, our proposed primes are abundant at any bitlength, whereas\nGMNs are extremely rare. Our multiplication and reduction algorithms can also\nbe easily parallelised, making our arithmetic particularly suitable for\nhardware implementation.

When\nsufficient gas is driven towards the BH, gravitational instabilities\ngenerically form lopsided, eccentric disks that propagate inwards. The lopsided\nstellar disk exerts a strong torque on the gas disk, driving inflows that fuel\nrapid BH growth. Here, we investigate whether the same gas disk is the 'torus'\ninvoked to explain obscured AGN. The disk is generically thick and has\ncharacteristic ~1-10 pc sizes and masses resembling those required of the\ntorus. The scale heights and obscured fractions of the predicted torii are\nsubstantial even in the absence of strong stellar feedback providing the\nvertical support. Rather, they can be maintained by strong bending modes and\nwarps excited by the inflow-generating instabilities. Other properties commonly\nattributed to feedback processes may be explained by dynamical effects:\nmisalignment between torus and host galaxy, correlations between local SFR and\nturbulent gas velocities, and dependence of obscured fractions on AGN\nluminosity or SFR. We compare the predicted torus properties with observations\nof gas surface density profiles, kinematics, scale heights, and SFR densities\nin AGN nuclei, and find that they are consistent. We argue that it is not\npossible to reproduce these observations and the observed column density (N_H)\ndistribution without a clumpy gas distribution, but allowing for clumping on\nsmall scales the predicted N_H distribution is in good agreement with\nobservations from 10^20-27 cm^-2.

The galaxies are selected by\ntheir joint soft X-ray (0.1-2.4 keV) and far-infrared ({\\lambda} = 60-100\n{\\mu}m) emission from the ROSAT/IRAS sample. Since the CO line widths (W CO)\nreflect the orbital motion in the gravitational potential of the host galaxy,\nwe study how the kinematics are affected by the central massive black hole\n(BH), using the X-ray luminosity. A significant correlation is found between\nthe CO line width and hard (0.3-8 keV from Chandra and XMM-Newton) X-ray\nluminosity for both types of Seyfert nuclei. Assuming an Eddington accretion to\nestimate the BH mass (M BH) from the X-ray luminosity, the W CO-L X relation\nestablishes a direct connection between the kinematics of the molecular gas of\nthe host galaxy and the nuclear activity, and corroborates the previous studies\nthat show that the CO is a good surrogate for the bulge mass.

Conversely, if the observed\nluminosities are merely from the cooling of the WDs, these estimated values of\nQ represent upper limits. A large Q_1 for the He WD means its spin velocity\nwill be slower than that expected if it was tidally locked, which, since the\nbinary is eclipsing, may be measurable via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.\nAfter one year, gravitational wave emission shifts the time of eclipses by 5.5\ns, but tidal interactions cause the orbit to shrink more rapidly, changing the\ntime by up to an additional 0.3 s after a year.

It arises\nfrom gravitational waves that are sourced by gravitational waves. Previous\nconsiderations of the nonlinear memory effect have focused on quasicircular\nbinaries. Here, I consider the nonlinear memory from Newtonian orbits with\narbitrary eccentricity. Expressions for the waveform polarizations and\nspin-weighted spherical-harmonic modes are derived for elliptic, hyperbolic,\nparabolic, and radial orbits. In the hyperbolic, parabolic, and radial cases\nthe nonlinear memory provides a 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) correction to the\nleading-order waveforms. This is in contrast to the elliptical and\nquasicircular cases, where the nonlinear memory corrects the waveform at\nleading (0PN) order. This difference in PN order arises from the fact that the\nmemory builds up over a short \"scattering\" time scale in the hyperbolic case,\nas opposed to a much longer radiation-reaction time scale in the elliptical\ncase. The nonlinear memory corrections presented here complete our knowledge of\nthe leading-order (Peters-Mathews) waveforms for elliptical orbits. These\ncalculations are also relevant for binaries with quasicircular orbits in the\npresent epoch which had, in the past, large eccentricities. Because the\nnonlinear memory depends sensitively on the past evolution of a binary, I\ndiscuss the effect of this early-time eccentricity on the value of the\nlate-time memory in nearly circularized binaries. I also discuss the\nobservability of large \"memory jumps\" in a binary's past that could arise from\nits formation in a capture process.

By\ncomparison with other fields where Fourier Transform theory is used, we propose\nthat we need to discern between measurement limitations and inherent\nlimitations when interpreting the impact of the HUP on the nature of the\nquantum level. We further propose that while measurement limitations result in\nour perception of indeterminism at the quantum level, there is no evidence that\nthere are any inherent limitations at the quantum level, based on the\nNyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 01:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-17"}

Developing this model and a means to\ncalibrate it efficiently is relevant since HPV is a very multi-typed and common\nsexually transmitted infection with more than 100 types currently known. The\ntwo types studied in this paper, types 6 and 11, are causing about 90% of\nanogenital warts.\n  We extend the development of a sexual mixing matrix for the population, based\non a formulation first suggested by Garnett and Anderson.

Such conditions have recently been\nshown to be more powerful to characterize learnability in the general learning\nsetting under i.i.d. samples where uniform convergence is not necessary for\nlearnability, but where stability is both sufficient and necessary for\nlearnability. We here show that similar stability conditions are also\nsufficient for online learnability, i.e. whether there exists a learning\nalgorithm such that under any sequence of examples (potentially chosen\nadversarially) produces a sequence of hypotheses that has no regret in the\nlimit with respect to the best hypothesis in hindsight. We introduce online\nstability, a stability condition related to uniform-leave-one-out stability in\nthe batch setting, that is sufficient for online learnability. In particular we\nshow that popular classes of online learners, namely algorithms that fall in\nthe category of Follow-the-(Regularized)-Leader, Mirror Descent, gradient-based\nmethods and randomized algorithms like Weighted Majority and Hedge, are\nguaranteed to have no regret if they have such online stability property.

In the internetwork regions, Hall drift\ndominates above $0.25 Mm$ in the photosphere and below $2.5 Mm$ in the\nchromosphere. Although Hall drift does not cause any dissipation in the ambient\nplasma, it can destabilise the flux tubes and magnetic elements in the presence\nof azimuthal shear flow. The physical mechanism of this instability is quite\nsimple: the shear flow twists the radial magnetic field and generates azimuthal\nfield; torsional oscillations of the azimuthal field in turn generates the\nradial field completing feedback loop. The maximum growth rate of Hall\ninstability is proportional to the absolute value of the shear gradient and is\ndependent on the ambient diffusivity. The diffusivity also determines the most\nunstable wavelength which is smaller for weaker fields.\n  We apply the result of local stability analysis to the network and\ninternetwork magnetic elements and show that the maximum growth rate for\nkilogauss field occurs around $0.5 Mm$ and decreases with increasing altitude.\nHowever, for a $120 G$ field, the maximum growth rate remains almost constant\nin the entire photosphere-lower chromosphere except in a small region of lower\nphotosphere. For shear flow gradient $\\sim 0.01 s^{-1}$, the Hall growth time\nis 10 minute near the footpoint. Therefore, network fields are likely to be\nunstable in the photosphere, whereas internetwork fields could be unstable in\nthe entire photosphere-chromosphere. Thus the Hall instability can play an\nimportant role in generating low frequency turbulence which can heat the\nchromosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 07:28:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2012 23:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2012 06:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-11"}

We therefore used an electrical training process to\nobtain ferroelectric control of the diode polarity where, by changing the\npolarization direction using an external bias, we could switch the transport\ncharacteristics between forward and reverse diodes.

Firstly, the\ndynamics of solar sail and the characteristics of the H-reversal trajectory are\nanalyzed. Then, the attitude of the solar sail is optimized to guide the sail\nto impact with the object asteroid along a H-reversal trajectory. The impact\nvelocity depends on two important parameters: the minimum solar distance along\nthe trajectory and lightness number. A larger lightness number and a smaller\nsolar distance lead to a higher impact velocity. Finally, the deflection\ncapability of a solar sail impacting with the asteroid along the H-reversal is\ndiscussed.

On cooling,\nthe modulus presents a narrow dip at the MIT followed by an abrupt stiffening\nof ~6%. The anomaly is reproducible between cooling and heating in\nNd0:65Eu0:35NiO3 but only appears as a slow stiffening during cooling in\nundoped NdNiO3, conformingly with the fact that the MIT in RNiO3 changes from\nstrongly first order to second order when the mean R size is decreased. The\nelastic anomaly seems not to be associated with the antiferromagnetic\ntransition, which is distinct from the MIT in Nd0.65Eu0.35NiO3. It is concluded\nthat the steplike stiffening is due to the disappearance or freezing of dynamic\nJahn- Teller (JT) distortions through the MIT, where the JT active Ni3+ is\ndisproportionated into alternating Ni3+d and Ni3-d. The fluctuating octahedral\nJT distortion necessary to justify the observed jump in the elastic modulus is\nestimated as ~3%, but does not have a role in determining the MIT, since the\notherwise expected precursor softening is not observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 09:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We present the newest results of our\nlaboratory experiment investigating \"rigid\" coronagraph with a binary shaped\ncheckerboard pupil mask, which should offer a highly stable solution for\ntelescopes without adaptive optics (AO) for wavefront correction in space\nmissions. The primary aim of this work was to study the stability of the\ncoronagraph, and to demonstrate its performance without adaptive wavefront\ncorrection. Estimation of both the raw contrast and the gain of the point\nspread function (PSF) subtraction were needed. The limiting factor of the\ncontrast was also important. A binary shaped pupil mask of a checkerboard type\nhas been designed. The mask, consisting of an aluminum film on a glass\nsubstrate, was manufactured using nano-fabrication techniques with electron\nbeam lithography. Careful evaluation of coronagraphic performance, including\nPSF subtraction, was carried out in air using the developed mask. A contrast of\n$6.7 \\times 10^{-8}$ was achieved for the raw coronagraphic image by areal\naveraging of all of the observed dark regions. Following PSF subtraction, the\ncontrast reached $6.8 \\times 10^{-9}$. Speckles were a major limiting factor\nthroughout the dark regions of both the raw image and the PSF subtracted image.\nA rigid coronagraph with PSF subtraction without AO is a useful method to\nachieve high contrast observations. Applications of a rigid coronagraph to a\nSpace Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) and other\nplatforms are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 09:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-17"}

We analyze our data together with the H_2 lines,\nCO(3-2), and IR continuum from the literature using a combined PDR/shock model.\nWe find that the mid-J CO originates almost entirely from shock-excited warm\nmolecular gas; contributions from PDRs are negligible. Also, almost all the H_2\nS(2) and half of the S(1) line is predicted to emerge from shocks. Shocks with\na pre-shock density of 2x10^4 cm^-3 and velocities of 10 km/s and 20 km/s for\nC-shocks and J-shocks, respectively, provide the best fit.

We also find\nthat, while the azimuthal current in the inner region is dominated by hot\nplasma pressure, as is generally held to be the case at Jupiter, the use of a\nrealistic plasma angular velocity profile actually results in the centrifugal\ncurrent becoming dominant in the outer magnetosphere. In addition, despite the\ndependence of the intensity of the azimuthal current on the\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system parameters, the location of\nthe peak field-aligned current in the equatorial plane also varies, such that\nthe ionospheric location remains roughly constant.

The spectral properties of the triplet strongly\ndepends on pump power and detuning of the excitation laser. The three closely\nspaced photon channels from the resonance fluorescence have different photon\nstatistical signatures.

The photon correlation measurements\ndemonstrate both 'single' and 'heralded' photon emission from the Mollow\ntriplet sidebands.

We identify active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\nin these infrared sources through their X-ray emission and quantify the\nfraction that host an AGN. We find that the fraction depends strongly on both\nthe mid-infrared color and rest-frame mid-infrared luminosity of the source,\nrising to ~ 50-70% at the warmest colors and highest mid-infrared luminosities\n(corresponding to ultraluminous infrared galaxies), similar to the trends found\nlocally. Additionally, we find that the AGN fraction depends strongly on the\nstar formation rate of the host galaxy (inferred from the observed 70 um\nluminosity after subtracting the estimated AGN contribution), particularly for\nmore luminous AGNs (L_X > 10^43 erg/s). At the highest star formation rates (~\n1000 M_sun/yr), the fraction of galaxies with an X-ray detected AGN rises to ~\n30%, roughly consistent with that found in high-redshift submillimeter\ngalaxies. Assuming that the AGN fraction is driven by the star formation rate\n(rather than stellar mass or redshift, for which our sample is largely\ndegenerate), this result implies that the duty cycle of luminous AGN activity\nincreases with the star formation rate of the host galaxy: specifically, we\nfind that luminous X-ray detected AGNs are at least ~ 5-10 times more common in\nsystems with high star formation rates (> 300 M_sun/yr) than in systems with\nlower star formation rates (< 30 M_sun/yr). Lastly, we investigate the ratio\nbetween the supermassive black hole accretion rate and the growth rate of the\nhost galaxy and find that, for sources with detected AGNs and star formation,\nthis ratio in distant starbursts agrees well with that expected from the local\nscaling relation assuming the black holes and bulges grew at the same epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 12:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

These techniques, however, do not address issues that arise for\nlow-level languages, i.e., stack-based imperative languages that lack strong\ntype systems and automatic memory management.\n  In this paper, we describe techniques for self-adjusting computation which\nare suitable for low-level languages. Necessarily, we take a different approach\nthan previous work: instead of starting with a high-level language with\nadditional primitives to support self-adjusting computation, we start with a\nlow-level intermediate language, whose semantics is given by a stack-based\nabstract machine. We prove that this semantics is sound: it always updates\ncomputations in a way that is consistent with full reevaluation. We give a\ncompiler and runtime system for the intermediate language used by our abstract\nmachine. We present an empirical evaluation that shows that our approach is\nefficient in practice, and performs favorably compared to prior proposals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 15:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-17"}

We include both target mass corrections and large x\nresummation effects. These effects are of order O(1/Q^2), and they improve the\nagreement with the Q^2 dependence of the data. Standard analyses require the\npresence of additional power corrections, or dynamical higher twists, to\nachieve a fully quantitative fit. Our analysis, however, is regulated by the\nvalue of the strong coupling in the infrared region that enters through large x\nresummation effects, and that can suppress, or absorb, higher twist effects.\nLarge x data therefore indirectly provide a measurement of this quantity that\ncan be compared to extractions from other observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 15:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The blind search was conducted within 3deg of the\nGalactic plane and at longitudes between 20 and 110deg. It takes 22073\npointings to cover this region, and 5487 different positions in the sky. The\nfirst targeted search was aimed at Galactic globular clusters, the second one\nat 24 bright polarized and pointlike radiosources with steep spectra, and the\nthird at 65 faint polarized and pointlike radiosources. The observations were\nconducted at the large radiotelescope of Nancay Observatory, at a frequency\nnear 1400 MHz. Two successive backends were used, first a VLBI S2 system,\nsecond a digital acquisition board and a PC with large storage capacity\nsampling the signal at 50 Mb/s on one bit, over a 24-MHz band and in one\npolarization. The bandwidth of acquisition of the second backend was later\nincreased to 48 MHz and the sampling rate to 100 Mb/s. The survey used the\nthree successive setups, with respective sensitivities of 3.5, 2.2, and 1.7\nmJy. The targeted-search data were obtained with the third setup and reduced\nwith a method based on the Hough transform, yielding a sensitivity of 0.9 mJy.\nThe processing of the data was done in slightly differed time by\nsoft-correlation in all cases. No new short-period millisecond pulsars were\ndiscovered in the different searches. To better understand the null result of\nthe blind survey, we estimate the probability of detecting one or more\nshort-period pulsars among a given Galactic population of synthetic pulsars\nwith our setup: 25% for the actual incomplete survey and 79% if we had\ncompleted the whole survey with a uniform nominal sensitivity of 1.7 mJy.
