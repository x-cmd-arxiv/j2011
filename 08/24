Although resting\nbrain has been extensively investigated for low frequency synchrony between\nbrain regions, namely Functional Connectivity (FC), the other main stream of\nbrain connectivity analysis that seeks causal interactions between brain\nregions, Effective Connectivity (EC), has been little explored in spontaneous\nbrain oscillations. Inherent complexity of brain activities in resting-state,\nas is observed in BOLD (Blood Oxygenation-Level Dependant) fluctuations, call\nfor exploratory methods for characterizing these causal networks. On the other\nhand, the inevitable effects that hemodynamic system imposes on causal\ninferences based on fMRI data, lead us toward the methods in which causal\ninferences can take place in latent neuronal level, rather than observed BOLD\ntime-series. To simultaneously satisfy these two concerns, in this paper, we\nintroduce a novel state-space system identification approach for studying\ncausal interactions among brain regions in the absence of explicit cognitive\ntask. Using extensive simulations, we study the effects of network size and\nsignal to noise ratio (SNR) on the accuracy of our proposed method in EC\ndetection. Our simulations demonstrate that Subspace-based Identification\nAlgorithm (SIA) is sufficiently robust against above-mentioned factors, and can\nreliably unravel the underlying causal interactions of resting-state BOLD fMRI\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 16:03:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2011 08:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

This study investigates quasi-circular frozen\norbits and examines their basic nature analytically using two different\nmethods. First, an analytical method based on Lagrangian formulations is\napplied to obtain constraint conditions for Martian frozen orbits. Second, Lie\ntransforms are employed to locate these orbits accurately, and draw the\ncontours of the Hamiltonian to show evolutions of the equilibria. Both methods\nare verified by numerical integrations in an 80\\times80 Mars gravity field. The\nsimulations demonstrate that these two analytical methods can provide accurate\nenough results. By comparison, the two methods are found well consistent with\neach other, and both discover four families of Martian frozen orbits: three\nfamilies with small eccentricities and one family near the critical\ninclination. The results also show some valuable conclusions: for the majority\nof Martian frozen orbits, argument of pericentre are kept at 270 degrees\nbecause J3 has the same sign with J2; while for a minority of ones with low\naltitude and low inclination, argument of pericentre are possible to be kept at\n90 degrees because of the effect of the higher degree odd zonals; for the\ncritical inclinations cases, argument of pericentre can also be kept at 90\ndegrees. It is worthwhile to note that there exist some special frozen orbits\nwith extremely small eccentricity, which could provide much convenience for\nreconnaissance. Finally, the stability of Martian frozen orbits is estimated\nbased on the trace of the monodromy matrix. The analytical investigations can\nprovide good initial conditions for numerical correction methods in the more\ncomplex models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 16:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

The construction\nof sparse universal graphs for various families F has received a considerable\namount of attention. One is particularly interested in tight F-universal\ngraphs, i.e., graphs whose number of vertices is equal to the largest number of\nvertices in a graph from F. Arguably, the most studied case is that when F is\nsome class of trees.\n  Given integers n and \\Delta, we denote by T(n,\\Delta) the class of all\nn-vertex trees with maximum degree at most \\Delta. In this work, we show that\nevery n-vertex graph satisfying certain natural expansion properties is\nT(n,\\Delta)-universal or, in other words, contains every spanning tree of\nmaximum degree at most \\Delta. Our methods also apply to the case when \\Delta\nis some function of n. The result has a few very interesting implications. Most\nimportantly, we obtain that the random graph G(n,p) is asymptotically almost\nsurely (a.a.s.) universal for the class of all bounded degree spanning (i.e.,\nn-vertex) trees provided that p \\geq c n^{-1/3} \\log^2n where c > 0 is a\nconstant.

For constant \\Delta,\nwe show that one can (randomly) construct n-vertex T(n,\\Delta)-universal graphs\nwith clique number at most five. Finally, we show robustness of random graphs\nwith respect to being universal for T(n,\\Delta) in the context of the\nMaker-Breaker tree-universality game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 16:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-24"}

The purpose of this paper is to address both questions. The theory of\nthe deuteron stripping is developed, which is based on the post continuum\ndiscretized coupled channels (CDCC) formalism going beyond of the DWBA and\nsurface integral formulation of the reaction theory [A. S. Kadyrov et al., Ann.\nPhys. {\\bf 324}, 1516 (2009)]. First, the formalism is developed for the DWBA\nand then extended to the CDCC formalism, which is ultimate goal of this work.\nThe CDCC wave function takes into account not only the initial elastic $d+ A$\nchannel but also its coupling to the deuteron breakup channel $p + n + A$\nmissing in the DWBA. Stripping to both bound states and resonances are\nincluded. The convergence problem for stripping to resonance states is solved\nin the post CDCC formalism. The reaction amplitude is parametrized in terms of\nthe reduced width amplitudes (ANCs), inverse level matrix, boundary condition\nand channel radius, that is the same parameters which are used in the\nconventional $R$-matrix method. For stripping to resonance states many-level,\none and two-channel cases are considered. The theory provides a consistent tool\nto analyze both binary resonant reactions and deuteron stripping in terms of\nthe same parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 18:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 02:30:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 03:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 19:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 17:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The\nclosest of these, the T6 dwarf WISE 1506+7027, is believed to fall at a\ndistance of roughly 4.9 pc. WISE multi-epoch positions supplemented with\npositional info primarily from Spitzer/IRAC allow us to calculate proper\nmotions and tangential velocities for roughly one half of the new discoveries.\nThis work represents the first step by WISE to complete a full-sky,\nvolume-limited census of late-T and Y dwarfs. Using early results from this\ncensus, we present preliminary, lower limits to the space density of these\nobjects and discuss constraints on both the functional form of the mass\nfunction and the low-mass limit of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 19:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The Milky Way's dwarf satellites contain a large fraction (~30%) of\nthe known most metal-poor stars that have chemical abundances that closely\nresemble those of equivalent halo stars. This suggests that chemical evolution\nmay be universal, at least at early times, and that it is driven by massive,\nenergetic SNe.

We also find that there is no strong correlation between\nthe mass-normalized total specific star formation rate and cluster mass,\nindicating that the mass of the host cluster does not strongly influence the\ntotal star formation rate of cluster members.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 20:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We propose\nnovel ARQ protocol designs that optimize these tradeoffs. We first derive the\ndiversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoff (DMDT) in the high SNR regime, where the\ndelay is caused only by retransmissions. This asymptotic DMDT shows that the\nperformance of an N node network is limited by the weakest three-node\nsub-network, and the performance of a three-node sub-network is determined by\nits weakest link, and, hence, the optimal ARQ protocol needs to equalize the\nperformance on each link by allocating ARQ window sizes optimally. This\nequalization is captured through a novel Variable Block-Length (VBL) ARQ\nprotocol that we propose, which achieves the optimal DMDT.\n  We then consider the DMDT in the finite SNR regime, where the delay is caused\nby both the ARQ retransmissions and queueing. We characterize the finite SNR\nDMDT of the fixed ARQ protocol, when an end-to-end delay constraint is imposed,\nby deriving the probability of message error using an approach that couples the\ninformation outage analysis with the queueing network analysis. The exponent of\nthe probability of deadline violation demonstrates that the system performance\nis again limited by the weakest three-node sub-network. The queueing delay\nchanges the consideration for optimal ARQ design: more retransmissions reduce\ndecoding error by lowering the information outage probability, but may also\nincrease message drop rate due to delay deadline violations. Hence, the optimal\nARQ should balance link performance while avoiding significant delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 21:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Using data on the relationship between\ntransmission and viral load we show that transmission saturates at high viral\nloads. We fit a power-law model and an exponential converging to an asymptote.\nUsing data on the viral load in HIV-positive people we show that ART is likely\nto reduce transmission by 91.6% (81.7%-96.2%) under the first and 99.5%\n(98.5%-99.8%) under the second model.\n  The role of the acute phase in HIV transmission is still debated. High levels\nof transmission during the acute phase have been used to argue that failure to\nidentify people in the acute phase of HIV may compromise the impact of\ntreatment on preventing new infections and that having concurrent sexual\npartners during the acute phase is an important driver of the epidemic. We show\nthat the acute phase probably accounts for less than 1% of overall\ntransmission. We also show that even if a significant proportion of infections\nare transmitted during the acute phase, this will not compromise the impact of\ntreatment on population levels of transmission given the constraint implied by\nthe doubling time of the epidemic.\n  This analysis leads to other relevant conclusions. First, it is likely that\ndiscordant-couple studies significantly underestimate the risk of infection.\nSecond, attention should be paid to the variability in set point viral load\nwhich determines both the infectiousness of HIV-positive people and the\nvariability in the susceptibility of HIV-negative people. Third, if ART drugs\nare in short supply those with the highest viral load should be given priority,\nothers things including age, gender and opportunistic infections being equal,\nbut to reduce transmission ART should be offered to all those with a viral load\nabove about 10k/mm.3\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 22:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

Pinpointing the critical value with arbitrary accuracy is even\nmore challenging. In this work, we adopt the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)\nmethod to determine the critical values and the mean solutions around such\nvalues. First, we consider the critical value associated with the strength of\nthe singular potential for the Klein-Gordon equation. We expand the solution in\nthe random variable associated with the parameter. The obtained partial\ndifferential equations are solved using the Chebyshev collocation method. Due\nto the existence of the singularity, the Gibbs phenomenon appears in the\nsolution, yielding a slow convergence of the numerically computed critical\nvalue. To deal with the singularity, we adopt the consistent spectral\ncollocation method. The gPC method, along with the consistent Chebyshev method,\ndetermines the critical value and the mean solution highly efficiently. We then\nconsider the sine-Gordon equation, for which the critical value is associated\nwith the initial velocity of the kink soliton solution. The critical behavior\nin this case is that the solution passes through (particle-pass), is trapped by\n(particle-capture), or is reflected by (particle-reflection) the singular\npotential if the initial velocity of the soliton solution is greater than,\nequal to, or less than the critical value, respectively. We use the gPC mean\nvalue rather than reconstructing the solution to find the critical parameter.\nNumerical results show that the critical value can be determined efficiently\nand accurately by using the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 23:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

Mars' gravity field is much more complicated,\nwith relatively smaller J2, compared to Earth's, which makes the behaviors of\nthese Martian orbits different from those of Earth.

Employing this convenient form of the vertex \\emph{ansatz} into the\nSchwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) for the fermion propagator, we observe that it\nrenders the critical coupling in qQED4 markedly gauge independent in contrast\nwith the bare vertex and improves on the well-known Curtis-Pennington\nconstruction.

The progress towards exploring this size regime,\nhowever, has been hindered by the lack of a systematic approach to scaling down\nthe mode as the structures shrink in size and by the high threshold power\nrequired for lasing in small cavities. Here we present a new family of\nmetamaterial-like nano-cavities consisting of metallic coaxial nanostructures\nthat solves both of these problems. The proposed nanoscale coaxial cavities can\noperate as thresholdless lasers, and their size is not restricted by the mode\ncut-off. Using these new nano-cavities we have succeeded to demonstrate for the\nfirst time thresholdless lasing in a broadband gain medium, and the smallest\nroom temperature, continuous wave, telecom laser to date. The nanoscale coaxial\ncavities are the first systematic step towards unveiling the potentials of\nultra small quantum electrodynamical objects in which atom-field interactions\ngenerate new functionalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 05:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

It is possible for such an NEO to be temporarily\ncaptured by Earth; its orbit would thereby be changed and it would become an\nEarth-orbiting object after a small increase in its velocity. From the point of\nview of the Sun-Earth-NEO restricted three-body system, it is possible for an\nNEO whose Jacobian constant is slightly lower than C1 and higher than C3 to be\ntemporarily captured by Earth. When such an NEO approaches Earth, it is\npossible to change its orbit energy to close up the zero velocity surface of\nthe three-body system at point L1 and make the NEO become a small satellite of\nthe Earth.

NEAT will operate at\nL2 for 5 years, the telescope satellite moving around the focal plane one to\npoint different targets and allowing whole sky coverage in less than 20 days.\nThe payload is made of 3 subsystems: primary mirror and its dynamic support,\nthe focal plane with the detectors, and the metrology. The principle is to\nmeasure the angles between the target star, usually bright (R \\leq 6), and\nfainter reference stars (R \\leq 11) using a metrology system that projects\ndynamical Young's fringes onto the focal plane. The proposed architecture\nrelies on two satellites of about 700 kg, offering a capability of more than\n20,000 reconfigurations. The two satellites are launched in a stacked\nconfiguration using a Soyuz ST launch, and are deployed after launch to\nindividually perform cruise to their operational Lissajous orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 08:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Methods:\nThe GALPROP programme for cosmic-ray propagation, gamma-ray and synchrotron\nradiation is used. Secondary electrons and positrons are included. Propagation\nmodels based on cosmic-ray and gamma-ray data are tested against synchrotron\ndata from 22 MHz to 94 GHz. Results: The synchrotron data confirm the need for\na low-energy break in the cosmic-ray electron injection spectrum. The\ninterstellar spectrum below a few GeV has to be lower than standard models\npredict, and this suggests less solar modulation than usually assumed.\nReacceleration models are more difficult to reconcile with the synchrotron\nconstraints. We show that secondary leptons are important for the\ninterpretation of synchrotron emission. We also consider a cosmic-ray\npropagation origin for the low-energy break.

The measurement of the energy\nspectrum of boron also extends into the TeV amu$^{-1}$ region. The relative\nabundances of the primary nuclei, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, above\n$\\sim10$ GeV amu$^{-1}$ are independent of energy, while the boron abundance,\ni.e. the B/C abundance ratio, decreases with energy as expected. However, there\nis an indication that the previously reported $E^{-0.6}$ dependence of the B/C\nratio does not continue to the highest energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 13:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-04"}

The successful and surprising discovery of the SinCm\nBucky-diamond structure at the specific composition of n=68 and m=79 is the\nresult of the relaxation of the truncated bulk 3C-SiC network to yield a SinCm\ncluster with m +n=147. It highlights the important role played by the\ncomposition in determining the structure and hence other properties of\nSiC-based nano-structures. We have also shed light on the mechanism behind the\nformation of the Bucky-diamond structure. The formation process is initiated by\nthe induced bonds between pairs of surface carbon atoms of the initial\nconfiguration of the Si68C79 cluster obtained by truncating bulk 3C-SiC\nnetwork. This action then continuously incorporates atoms in the six outer\nshells of the Si68C79 clusters to form the 112-atom Fullerene shell through\nnearest neighbor Si-C interactions. Because the 35-atom inner core with five\ncompletely filled shells only interacts weakly with the Fullerene shell through\nthe six atoms on its \"surface\", the diamond-like inner core is barely perturbed\nand is suspended inside the Fullerene shell. We have also suggested a likely\nroute of synthesizing the SiC Bucky-diamond structure based on the result of\nour simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 13:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

The sp3d5s*-spin-orbit-coupled atomistic tight-binding (TB) model is\nused for the electronic structure calculation. Linearized Boltzmann transport\ntheory is applied, including carrier scattering by phonons, surface roughness\n(SRS), and impurities. We present a comprehensive investigation of the\nlow-field mobility in silicon NWs considering: i) n- and p-type NWs, ii) [100],\n[110], and [111] transport orientations, and iii) diameters from D=12nm\n(electronically almost bulk-like) down to D=3nm (ultra-scaled). The simulation\nresults display strong variations in the characteristics of the different NW\ntypes. For n-type NWs, phonon scattering and SRS become stronger as the\ndiameter is reduced and drastically degrade the mobility by up to an order of\nmagnitude depending on the orientation. For the [111] and [110] p-type NWs, on\nthe other hand, large mobility enhancements (of the order of ~4X) can be\nachieved as the diameter scales down to D=3nm. This enhancement originates from\nthe increase in the subband curvatures as the diameter is scaled. It\novercompensates for the mobility reduction caused by SRS in narrow NWs and\noffers an advantage with diameter scaling. Our results may provide\nunderstanding of recent experimental measurements, as well as guidance in the\ndesign of NW channel devices with improved transport properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 15:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}
