Differences are primarily due to filtering, a fundamental\nintrinsic feature of LES. Filtering the fluid velocity field yields approximate\ncomputation of the forces acting on particles and, in turn, trajectories that\nare inaccurate when compared to those of DNS. In this paper, we focus precisely\non the filtering error for which we quantify a lower bound. To this aim, we use\na DNS database of inertial particle dispersion in turbulent channel flow and we\nperform a-priori tests in which the error purely due to filtering is singled\nout removing error accumulation effects, which would otherwise lead to\nprogressive divergence between DNS and LES particle trajectories. By applying\nfilters of different type and width at varying particle inertia, we\ncharacterize the statistical properties of the filtering error as a function of\nthe wall distance. Results show that filtering error is stochastic and has a\nnon-Gaussian distribution. In addition, the distribution of the filtering error\ndepends strongly on the wall-normal coordinate being maximum in the buffer\nregion. Our findings provide insight on the effect of subgrid-scale velocity\nfield on the force driving the particles, and establish the requirements which\na LES model must satisfy to predict correctly the velocity and the trajectory\nof inertial particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 16:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-04"}

We used a two-parameter function to determine, for\neach test star and QSO, the maximum of the diffraction pattern and to calculate\nthe Strehl ratio.\n  Results: Our results go far beyond those already present in the literature.\nBy adopting the most conservative approach where the correction terms, that\ndescribe the possibility for space-time fluctuations cumulating across long\ndistances and partially compensate for the effects of the phase variations, are\ntaken into account.

The Erdos-Szekely bijection specializes to a\nbijection between phylogenetic trees and set partitions with classes of size\n\\geq 2. We consider modified Stirling numbers of the second kind that enumerate\npartitions of a fixed set into a given number of classes of size \\geq 2, and\nobtain their asymptotic normality as the number of classes varies. The Erdos-\nSzekely bijection translates this result into the asymptotic normality of the\nnumber of phylogenetic trees with given number of vertices, when the number of\nleaves varies. We also obtain asymptotic normality of the number of\nphylogenetic trees with given number of leaves and varying number of internal\nvertices, which make more sense to students of phylogeny. By the Erdos-Szekely\nbijection this means the asymptotic normality of the number of partitions of n\n+ m elements into m classes of size \\geq 2, when n is fixed and m varies. The\nproofs are adaptations of the techniques of L.H. Harper [ibid.]. We provide\nasymptotics for the relevant expectations and variances with error term O(1/n).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 17:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

The column density in these objects is less than 10^24 cm-2, which\nimplies that the Swift/BAT data allow us to study the \"true\" variability of the\ncentral source. Results: All objects show significant variations, with an\namplitude which is similar to the AGN variability amplitude at energies below\n10 keV. We found evidence for an anti-correlation between variability amplitude\nand black hole mass. The light curves in both bands are well correlated, with\nno significant delays on time scales as short as 2 days. NGC 4151 and NGC 2110\ndo not show spectral variability, but we found a significant anti-correlation\nbetween hardness ratios and source flux in NGC 4388 (and NGC 4945, IC 4329, to\na lesser extent). This \"softer when brighter\" behaviour is similar to what has\nbeen observed at energies below 10 keV, and cannot be explained if the\ncontinuum varies only in flux; the intrinsic shape should also steepen with\nincreasing flux. Conclusions: The presence of significant flux variations\nindicate that the central source in these objects is intrinsically variable on\ntime scales as short as 1-2 days. The intrinsic slope of the continuum varies\nwith the flux (at least in NGC 4388). The positive \"spectral slope-flux\"\ncorrelation can be explained if the temperature of the hot corona decreases\nwith increasing flux. The lack of spectral variations in two objects, could be\ndue to the fact that they may operate in a different \"state\", as their\naccretion rate is less than 1% of the Eddington limit (significantly smaller\nthan the rate of the other three objects in the sample).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 17:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2011 14:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

HAWC will consist of 300 large water tanks instrumented with\n4 photomultipliers each. HAWC has two data acquisition (DAQ) systems. The main\nDAQ system reads out coincident signals in the tanks and reconstructs the\ndirection and energy of individual atmospheric showers.

Here we present the first measurement of\nsulphur in the metal poor globular cluster (GC) NGC 6397, as detected in a\nMIKE/Magellan high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectrum of one red giant\nstar. While abundance ratios of sulphur are available for a larger number of\nGalactic stars down to an [Fe/H] of ~ -3.5 dex, no measurements in globular\nclusters more metal poor than -1.5 dex have been reported so far.

The [S/Mg] and [S/Ca] ratios in\nthis star are compatible with a Solar value to within the (large)\nuncertainties. Despite the very large scatter in these ratios across Galactic\nstars between literature samples, this indicates that sulphur traces the\nchemical imprints of the other alpha-elements in metal poor GCs. Combined with\nits moderate sodium abundance ([S/Na]_NLTE=0.48), the [S/Fe] ratio in this GC\nextends a global, positive S-Na correlation that is not seen in field stars and\nmight indicate that proton-capture reactions contributed to the production of\nsulphur in the (metal poor) early GC environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

From observations, most volatile species are\nfound in H2O-dominated ices. The aim of this study is first to experimentally\ndetermine how entrapment of volatiles in H2O ice depends on ice thickness,\nmixture ratio and heating rate, and second, to introduce an extended\nthree-phase model (gas, ice surface and ice mantle) to describe ice mixture\ndesorption with a minimum number of free parameters. Thermal H2O:CO2 ice\ndesorption is investigated in temperature programmed desorption experiments of\nthin (10 - 40 ML) ice mixtures under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Desorption\nis simultaneously monitored by mass spectrometry and reflection-absorption\ninfrared spectroscopy. The H2O:CO2 experiments are complemented with selected\nH2O:CO, and H2O:CO2:CO experiments. The results are modeled with rate equations\nthat connect the gas, ice surface and ice mantle phases through surface\ndesorption and mantle-surface diffusion. The fraction of trapped CO2 increases\nwith ice thickness (10 - 32 ML) and H2O:CO2 mixing ratio (5:1 - 10:1), but not\nwith one order of magnitude different heating rates. The fraction of trapped\nCO2 is 44 - 84 % with respect to the initial CO2 content for the investigated\nexperimental conditions. This is reproduced quantitatively by the extended\nthree-phase model that is introduced here. The H2O:CO and H2O:CO2:CO\nexperiments are consistent with the H2O:CO2 desorption trends, suggesting that\nthe model can be used for other ice species found in the interstellar medium to\nsignificantly improve the parameterization of ice desorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-01"}

However, there is as yet no consensus over\nthe typical M* of SMGs. Specifically, even for the same set of SMGs, the\nreported average M* have ranged over an order of magnitude, from ~5x10^10 Mo to\n~5x10^11 Mo. Here we study how different methods of analysis can lead to such\nwidely varying results. We find that, contrary to recent claims in the\nliterature, potential contamination of IRAC 3-8 um photometry from hot dust\nassociated with an active nucleus is not the origin of the published\ndiscrepancies in derived M*. Instead, we expose in detail how inferred M*\ndepends on assumptions made in the photometric fitting, and quantify the\nindividual and cumulative effects of different choices of initial mass\nfunction, different brands of evolutionary synthesis models, and different\nforms of assumed star-formation history. We review current observational\nevidence for and against these alternatives as well as clues from the\nhydrodynamical simulations, and conclude that, for the most justifiable choices\nof these model inputs, the average M* of SMGs is ~2x10^11 Mo. We also confirm\nthat this number is perfectly reasonable in the light of the latest\nmeasurements of their dynamical masses, and the evolving M* function of the\noverall galaxy population. M* of this order imply that the average sSFR of SMGs\nis comparable to that of other star-forming galaxies at z>2, at 2-3 Gyr^-1.\nThis supports the view that, while rare outliers may be found at any M*, most\nSMGs simply form the top end of the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies at\nthese redshifts. Conversely, this argues strongly against the viewpoint that\nSMGs are extreme pathological objects, of little relevance in the cosmic\nhistory of star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 13:39:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 12:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-04"}

We carry out a new comparison of\nthis sort for the magnetic field growth from forced isotropic helical\nturbulence in a periodic box. Previous comparisons be- tween analytic theory\nand simulations of this problem have shown that a two-scale model compares well\nwith the simulations in agreeing that the driver of large scale field growth is\nthe difference between kinetic and current helicities associated with the small\nscale field, and that the backreaction that slows the growth of the large scale\nfield as the small scale current helicity grows. However, the two-scale model\nartificially re- stricts the small scale current helicity to reside at the same\nscale as the driving kinetic helicity. In addition, previous comparisons have\nfocused on the late time saturation regime, and less on the early-time growth\nregime. Here we address these issues by comparing a three scale model to new\nsimulations for both early and late time growth regimes. We find that the\nminimalist extension to three scales provides a better model for the field\nevolution than the two-scale model because the simulations show that the small\nscale current helicity does not reside at the same scale as that of the driving\nkinetic helicity. The simulations also show that the peak of the small scale\ncurrent helicity migrates toward lower wave numbers as the growth evolves from\nthe fast to saturated growth regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 20:50:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 20:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

However, traditional methods of estimating continua in noisy and\nmoderate-resolution spectra (S/N < 10 pixel^-1 and R ~ 2000, respectively, such\nas SDSS) using power-law extrapolation or the mean spectrum, achieve no better\nthan ~ 10-15% RMS accuracy. To improve on this, we introduce mean-flux\nregulated/principal component analysis (MF-PCA) continuum fitting. In this\ntechnique, PCA fitting is carried out redwards of the quasar Lyman-alpha line\nin order to provide a prediction for the shape of the Lyman-alpha forest\ncontinuum. The slope and amplitude of this continuum prediction is then\ncorrected using external constraints for the Lyman-alpha forest mean-flux. From\ntests on mock spectra, we find that MF-PCA reduces the errors to 8% RMS in S/N\n~ 2 spectra, and < 5% RMS in spectra with S/N > 5. The residual Fourier power\nin the continuum is decreased by a factor of a few in comparison with dividing\nby the mean continuum, enabling Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum measurements to\nbe extended to ~2x larger scales. Using this new technique, we make available\ncontinuum fits for 12,069 z>2.3 Lyman-alpha forest spectra from SDSS DR7 for\nuse by the community. This technique is also applicable to future releases of\nthe ongoing BOSS survey, which is obtaining spectra for ~ 150,000 Lyman-alpha\nforest spectra at low signal-to-noise (S/N ~ 2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 20:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

The\ninferred intrinsic shape distribution of these early-type galaxies is strongly\nmass dependent: the typical short-to-long intrinsic axis-ratio of high-mass\nearly-type galaxies (>1e11 M_sun) is 2:3, where as at masses below 1e11 M_sun\nthis ratio narrows to 1:3, or more flattened galaxies.

The\nisomorphism is between the Lie algebra cohomology of a bicrossed sum Lie\nalgebra and the Hopf cyclic cohomology of its Hopf algebra. We first prove a\none to one correspondence between stable-anti-Yetter-Drinfeld (SAYD) modules\nover the total Lie algebra and SAYD modules over the associated Hopf algebra.\nIn contrast to the non-general case done in our previous work, here the van Est\nisomorphism is found at the first level of a natural spectral sequence, rather\nthan at the level of complexes. It is proved that the Connes-Moscovici Hopf\nalgebras do not admit any finite dimensional SAYD modules except the unique\none-dimensional one found by Connes- Moscovici in 1998. This is done by\nextending our techniques to work with the infinite dimensional Lie algebra of\nformal vector fields.

Under either a Neyman-Pearson or a Bayesian\nformulation, we show that the asymptotically optimal (in the limit of a large\nnumber of sensors) detection performance (as quantified by error exponents)\ndoes not benefit from the feedback messages, if the fusion center remembers all\nsensor messages. However, feedback can improve the Bayesian detection\nperformance in the one-message feedback architecture if the fusion center has\nlimited memory; for that case, we determine the corresponding optimal error\nexponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 03:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-01"}

The proposed MAC protocol is based on the carrier sense\nmultiple access (CSMA) strategy and can be regarded as an extension to the IEEE\n802.11 MAC protocol. In the proposed protocol, each node collects information\non the queue status of its neighboring nodes. When a node finds that there is\nan opportunity for some of its neighbors to perform PNC, it notifies its\ncorresponding neighboring nodes and initiates the process of packet exchange\nusing PNC, with the node itself as a relay. During the packet exchange process,\nthe relay also works as a coordinator which coordinates the transmission of\nsource nodes. Meanwhile, the proposed protocol is compatible with conventional\nnetwork coding and conventional transmission schemes. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed protocol is advantageous in various scenarios of wireless\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 06:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 18:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 19:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-15"}

This might be due to a deficit of attractive force from a scalar\nfield or two-pion exchange in the D4/D8/\\textoverline {D8} model. Then, we\nconsider D4/D6 type models with different number of quark flavors, $N_f=1,2,3$.\nThough the mass and radius of a holographic star is larger than those of normal\nneutron stars, the D4/D6 type EoS renders a stable compact star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 07:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This allows for a\nconceptual decoupling between the correlation properties of the process, which\nare imposed by the whitening operator L, and its sparsity pattern which is\ndetermined by the type of noise excitation. The latter is fully specified by a\nLevy measure. We show that the range of admissible innovation behavior varies\nbetween the purely Gaussian and super-sparse extremes.

The difference between the spatial\ndistributions of C-rich and oxygen-rich (O-rich) AGB stars is essential for the\nstudy of the Galactic structure and the chemical evolution of the interstellar\nmedium (ISM). Aims: We quantitatively investigate the spatial distributions of\nC-rich and O-rich AGB stars in our Galaxy. We discuss the difference between\nthem and its origin. Methods: We classify a large number of AGB stars newly\ndetected by the AKARI id-infrared all-sky survey. In the color-color diagrams,\nwe define their occupation zones based on the locations of known objects. We\nthen obtain the spatial distributions of C-rich and O-rich AGB stars, assuming\nthat they have the same luminosity for a given mass-loss rate. Results: We find\nthat O-rich AGB stars are concentrated toward the Galactic center and that the\ndensity decreases with Galactocentric distance, whereas C-rich AGB stars show a\nrelatively uniform distribution within about 8kpc of Sun.

Numerical simulations\ndemonstrate the emergence of a moist turbulent state consisting of ordered\nstructures with a clear power-law type spectral scaling from initially\nspatially uncorrelated conditions. An asymptotic analysis in the limit of rapid\ncondensation and strong stratification shows that, for initial conditions with\nenough water substance to saturate the domain, the equations support a\nstraightforward state of moist balance characterized by a hydrostatic,\nsaturated, vertically sheared horizontal flow (VSHF). For such initial\nconditions, by means of long time numerical simulations, the emergence of moist\nbalance is verified. Specifically, starting from uncorrelated data, subsequent\nto the development of a moist turbulent state, the system experiences a rather\nabrupt transition to a regime which is close to saturation and dominated by a\nstrong VSHF. On the other hand, initial conditions which do not have enough\nwater substance to saturate the domain, do not attain moist balance. Rather,\nthe system remains in a turbulent state and oscillates about moist balance.\nEven though balance is not achieved with these general initial conditions, the\ntime scale of oscillation about moist balance is much larger than the imposed\ntime scale of condensation and evaporation, thus indicating a distinct dominant\nslow component in the moist stratified two-dimensional turbulent system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 11:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

However, the magnetic properties\nof pristine GNRs are not predicted to be particularly robust in the presence of\nedge disorder. In this work, we examine the magnetic properties of GNRs doped\nwith transition-metal atoms using a combination of mean-field Hubbard and\nDensity Functional Theory techniques. The effect of impurity location on the\nmagnetic moment of such dopants in GNRs is investigated for the two principal\nGNR edge geometries - armchair and zigzag. Moment profiles are calculated\nacross the width of the ribbon for both substitutional and adsorbed impurities\nand regular features are observed for zigzag-edged GNRs in particular. Unlike\nthe case of edge-state induced magnetisation, the moments of magnetic\nimpurities embedded in GNRs are found to be particularly stable in the presence\nof edge disorder. Our results suggest that the magnetic properties of\ntransition-metal doped GNRs are far more robust than those with moments arising\nintrinsically due to edge geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 12:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In particular, the\ngoal is to encompass, in a self-consistent scheme, problems like Inflation,\nDark Energy, Dark Matter, Large Scale Structure and, first of all, to give at\nleast an effective description of Quantum Gravity. We review the basic\nprinciples that any gravitational theory has to follow. The geometrical\ninterpretation is discussed in a broad perspective in order to highlight the\nbasic assumptions of General Relativity and its possible extensions in the\ngeneral framework of gauge theories. Principles of such modifications are\npresented, focusing on specific classes of theories like f (R)-gravity and\nscalar-tensor gravity in the metric and Palatini approaches. The special role\nof torsion is also discussed. The conceptual features of these theories are\nfully explored and attention is payed to the issues of dynamical and conformal\nequivalence between them considering also the initial value problem. A number\nof viability criteria are presented considering the post-Newtonian and the\npost-Minkowskian limits.

By\ncomparing the bulge cluster CMDs to our previous analysis of the M54/Sgr core,\nwe estimate distances to these background features. The combined data from four\nSgr member clusters and five Sgr background features provides nine independent\nmeasures of the Sgr distance and, as a group, provide uniformly measured and\ncalibrated probes of different parts of the inner regions of Sgr spanning\ntwenty degrees over the face of the disrupting dwarf. This allows us, for the\nfirst time, to constrain the three dimensional orientation of Sgr's disrupting\ncore and globular cluster system and compare that orientation to the\npredictions of an N-body model of tidal disruption. The density and distance of\nSgr debris is consistent with models that favor a relatively high Sgr core mass\nand a slightly greater distance (28-30 kpc, with a mean of 29.4 kpc). Our\nanalysis also suggests that M54 is in the foreground of Sgr by ~2 kpc,\nprojected on the center of the Sgr dSph. While this would imply a remarkable\nalignment of the cluster and the Sgr nucleus along the line of sight, we can\nnot identify any systematic effect in our analysis that would falsely create\nthe measured 2 kpc separation. Finally, we find that the cluster Terzan 7 has\nthe most discrepant distance (25 kpc) among the four Sgr core clusters, which\nmay suggest a different dynamical history than the other Sgr core clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 15:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The determination\nof the companion star radial velocity would make it possible to fully resolve\nthe system and to accurately measure the mass of the neutron star based on\ndynamical measurements. Unfortunately, no optical/NIR counterpart has been\nidentified to date for this system, either in outburst or in quiescence.

The\nsource direction lies on the Galactic plane, making any search for its\noptical/NIR counterpart challenging. To minimize the effects of field crowding\nand interstellar extinction, we carried out our observations using the adaptive\noptics near-infrared imager NACO mounted at the ESO Very Large Telescope. From\nthe analysis of Swift X-ray data obtained during outburst, we derived the most\nprecise (1.6\" radius) position for this source. Due to the extreme stellar\ncrowding of the field, 41 sources are detected in our VLT images within the\nX-ray error circle, with some of them possibly showing variability consistent\nwith the expectations.

The transition and storing of\ncompressed multimedia data is much faster and more efficient than original\nuncompressed multimedia data. There are various techniques and standards for\nmultimedia data compression, especially for image compression such as the JPEG\nand JPEG2000 standards. These standards consist of different functions such as\ncolor space conversion and entropy coding. Arithmetic and Huffman coding are\nnormally used in the entropy coding phase. In this paper we try to answer the\nfollowing question. Which entropy coding, arithmetic or Huffman, is more\nsuitable compared to other from the compression ratio, performance, and\nimplementation points of view? We have implemented and tested Huffman and\narithmetic algorithms. Our implemented results show that compression ratio of\narithmetic coding is better than Huffman coding, while the performance of the\nHuffman coding is higher than Arithmetic coding. In addition, implementation of\nHuffman coding is much easier than the Arithmetic coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 15:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-02"}
