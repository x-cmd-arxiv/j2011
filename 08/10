We present here an easy to learn query language for a particular\nkind of annotation framework based on 'threaded trees', which are somewhere\nbetween the complete order of a tree and the anarchy of a graph. Through\n'typed' threads, they can allow multiple levels of annotation in the same\ndocument. Our language has a simple, intuitive and concise syntax and high\nexpressive power. It allows not only to search for complicated patterns with\nshort queries but also allows data manipulation and specification of arbitrary\nreturn values. Many of the commonly used tasks that otherwise require writing\nprograms, can be performed with one or more queries. We compare the language\nwith some others and try to evaluate it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 16:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-10"}

We apply this formalism to\nsimplicial gravity and (Euclidean) Regge calculus, in particular. A discrete\nforward/backward evolution is realized by gluing/removing single simplices step\nby step to/from a bulk triangulation and amounts to Pachner moves in the\ntriangulated hypersurfaces. As a result, the hypersurfaces evolve in a discrete\n`multi-fingered' time through the full Regge solution. Pachner moves are an\nelementary and ergodic class of homeomorphisms and generically change the\nnumber of variables, but can be implemented as canonical transformations on\nnaturally extended phase spaces. Some moves introduce a priori free data which,\nhowever, may become fixed a posteriori by constraints arising in subsequent\nmoves. The end result is a general and fully consistent formulation of\ncanonical Regge calculus, thereby removing a longstanding obstacle in\nconnecting covariant simplicial gravity models to canonical frameworks. The\npresent scheme is, therefore, interesting in view of many approaches to quantum\ngravity, but may also prove useful for numerical implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 16:35:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2012 22:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

So\nfar, the standard approach of distributed cross-layer design is based on dual\ndecomposition and the subgradient algorithm, which is a first-order method that\nhas a slow convergence rate. In this paper, we focus on solving a joint\nmulti-path routing and flow control (MRFC) problem by designing a new\ndistributed Newton's method, which is a second-order method and enjoys a\nquadratic rate of convergence. The major challenges in developing a distributed\nNewton's method lie in decentralizing the computation of the Hessian matrix and\nits inverse for both the primal Newton direction and dual variable updates. By\nappropriately reformulating, rearranging, and exploiting the special problem\nstructures, we show that it is possible to decompose such computations into\nsource nodes and links in the network, thus eliminating the need for global\ninformation. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for both the primal\nNewton direction and dual variable updates, thus significantly reducing the\ncomputational complexity. The most attractive feature of our proposed\ndistributed Newton's method is that it requires almost the same scale of\ninformation exchange as in first-order methods, while achieving a quadratic\nrate of convergence as in centralized Newton methods. We provide extensive\nnumerical results to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm. Our\nwork contributes to the advanced paradigm shift in cross-layer network design\nthat is evolving from first-order to second-order methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 17:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-11"}

Both the choice of the\n(non-orthogonal) reference frame and the conserved quantities are rather\nnon-standard, yet at the same time quite intuitive to the problem at hand. Two\nsuch problems are discussed in detail with two alternative approaches. The\nfirst approach does not even require knowledge of calculus.

One of\nthe most promising candidates to explain this excess of emission is electric\ndipole radiation from rapidly rotating very small dust grains, commonly\nreferred to as spinning dust. Photometric data obtained with the Spitzer Space\nTelescope have been reprocessed and used in conjunction with the dust emission\nmodel DUSTEM to characterise the properties of the dust within the cloud. This\nanalysis has allowed us to constrain spatial variations in the strength of the\ninterstellar radiation field ($\\chi_\\mathrm{ISRF}$), the mass abundances of the\nPAHs and VSGs relative to the BGs (Y$_\\mathrm{PAH}$ and Y$_\\mathrm{VSG}$), the\ncolumn density of hydrogen (N$_\\mathrm{H}$) and the equilibrium dust\ntemperature (T$_\\mathrm{dust}$). The parameter maps of Y$_\\mathrm{PAH}$,\nY$_\\mathrm{VSG}$ and $\\chi_\\mathrm{ISRF}$ are the first of their kind to be\nproduced for the Perseus cloud, and we used these maps to investigate the\nphysical conditions in which anomalous emission is observed. We find that in\nregions of anomalous emission the strength of the ISRF, and consequently the\nequilibrium temperature of the dust, is enhanced while there is no significant\nvariation in the abundances of the PAHs and the VSGs or the column density of\nhydrogen. We interpret these results as an indication that the enhancement in\n$\\chi_\\mathrm{ISRF}$ might be affecting the properties of the small\nstochastically heated dust grains resulting in an increase in the spinning dust\nemission observed at 33 GHz.

Among these phenomena are\nphotospheric turbulence, line profile variability (LPV), non-thermal emission,\nnon-radial pulsations, discrete absorption components (DACs) and wind clumping.\nCantiello et al. (2009) argued that a convection zone close to the stellar\nsurface could be responsible for some of these phenomena. This convective zone\nis caused by a peak in the opacity associated with iron-group elements and is\nreferred to as the \"iron convection zone\" (FeCZ). Assuming dynamo action\nproducing magnetic fields at equipartition in the FeCZ, we investigate the\noccurrence of subsurface magnetism in OB stars. Then we study the surface\nemergence of these magnetic fields and discuss possible observational\nsignatures of magnetic spots. Simple estimates are made using the subsurface\nproperties of massive stars, as calculated in 1D stellar evolution models. We\nfind that magnetic fields of sufficient amplitude to affect the wind could\nemerge at the surface via magnetic buoyancy. While at this stage it is\ndifficult to predict the geometry of these features, we show that magnetic\nspots of size comparable to the local pressure scale height can manifest\nthemselves as hot, bright spots. Localized magnetic fields could be widespread\nin those early type stars that have subsurface convection. This type of surface\nmagnetism could be responsible for photometric variability and play a role in\nX-ray emission and wind clumping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In the scenario where most stars are born with circumstellar\ndiscs, and that disc signatures decay monotonically (on average) over\ntimescales of only a few Myr, then any such age spread should lead to clear\ndifferences in the age distributions of stars with and without discs. We have\ninvestigated large samples of stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) using\nthree methods to diagnose disc presence from infrared measurements. We find no\nsignificant difference in the mean ages or age distributions of stars with and\nwithout discs, consistent with expectations for a coeval population. Using a\nsimple quantitative model we show that any real age spread must be smaller than\nthe median disc lifetime. For a log-normal age distribution, there is an upper\nlimit of <0.14 dex (at 99% confidence) to any real age dispersion, compared to\nthe ~=0.4 dex implied by the H-R diagram. If the mean age of the ONC is 2.5\nMyr, this would mean at least 95% of its low-mass stellar population has ages\nbetween 1.3--4.8 Myr. We suggest that the observed luminosity dispersion is\ncaused by a combination of observational uncertainties and physical mechanisms\nthat disorder the conventional relationship between luminosity and age for pre\nmain-sequence stars. This means that individual stellar ages from the H-R\ndiagram are unreliable and cannot be used to directly infer a star formation\nhistory.

The\nnearest neighbor class of a test object is the class that maximizes the\nprobability of providing its nearest neighbor.

The network deforms\neasily with increase in electrical and thermal conductivities suggestive of\nfloppy yet highly reconfigurable network. Insight from atomistically informed\ncoarse-grained simulations uncover an interplay between the extent of lateral\nassembly of the bundles, modulated by surface zipping/unzipping, and the\nelastic energy associated with the bent conformations of the nanotubes/bundles.\nDuring densification, the network becomes highly interconnected yet we observe\na modest increase in bundling primarily due to the reduced spacing between the\nSWCNTs. The stretching, on the other hand, is characterized by an initial\ndebundling regime as the strain accommodation occurs via unzipping of the\nbranched interconnects, followed by rapid re-bundling as the strain transfers\nto the increasingly aligned bundles. In both cases, the increase in the\nelectrical and thermal conductivity is primarily due to the increase in bundle\nsize; the changes in network connectivity have a minor effect on the transport.\nOur results have broad implications for filamentous networks of inorganic\nnanoassemblies composed of interacting tubes, wires and ribbons/belts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 22:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-11"}

A Byzantine node may introduce junk packets in the network\n(thus polluting downstream packets and causing the sinks to receive the wrong\ndata) or may choose coding coefficients in a way that significantly reduces the\nthroughput of the network.\n  Most prior work focused on the problem of Byzantine nodes polluting packets.\nHowever, even if a Byzantine node does not pollute packets, he can still affect\nsignificantly the throughput of the network by not coding correctly. No\nprevious work attempted to verify if a certain node \\emph{coded correctly using\nrandom coefficients} over \\emph{all} of the packets he was supposed to code\nover.\n  We provide two novel protocols (which we call PIP and Log-PIP) for detecting\nwhether a node coded correctly over all the packets received (i.e., according\nto a random linear network coding algorithm). Our protocols enable any node in\nthe network to examine a packet received from another node by running a\n\"verification test\". With our protocols, the worst an adversary can do and\nstill pass the packet verification test is in fact equivalent to random linear\nnetwork coding, which has been shown to be optimal in multicast networks. Our\nprotocols resist collusion among nodes and are applicable to a variety of\nsettings.\n  Our topology simulations show that the throughput in the worst case for our\nprotocol is two to three times larger than the throughput in various\nadversarial strategies allowed by prior work.

Answers, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and\netc.) emerged in recent years that allow requesters from all around the world\nto post tasks and seek help from an equally global pool of workers. However,\nintrinsic incentive problems reside in crowdsourcing applications as workers\nand requester are selfish and aim to strategically maximize their own benefit.\nIn this paper, we propose to provide incentives for workers to exert effort\nusing a novel game-theoretic model based on repeated games. As there is always\na gap in the social welfare between the non-cooperative equilibria emerging\nwhen workers pursue their self-interests and the desirable Pareto efficient\noutcome, we propose a novel class of incentive protocols based on social norms\nwhich integrates reputation mechanisms into the existing pricing schemes\ncurrently implemented on crowdsourcing websites, in order to improve the\nperformance of the non-cooperative equilibria emerging in such applications. We\nfirst formulate the exchanges on a crowdsourcing website as a two-sided market\nwhere requesters and workers are matched and play gift-giving games repeatedly.\nSubsequently, we study the protocol designer's problem of finding an optimal\nand sustainable (equilibrium) protocol which achieves the highest social\nwelfare for that website. We prove that the proposed incentives protocol can\nmake the website operate close to Pareto efficiency. Moreover, we also examine\nan alternative scenario, where the protocol designer aims at maximizing the\nrevenue of the website and evaluate the performance of the optimal protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 04:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-11"}

Any Bayesian inference depends on a likelihood and a\nprior. Ideally one would like to elicit a prior from related sources of\ninformation or past data. However, in its absence, Bayesian methods need to\nrely on some \"objective\" or \"default\" priors, and the resulting posterior\ninference can still be quite valuable. Not surprisingly, over the years, the\ncatalog of objective priors also has become prohibitively large, and one has to\nset some specific criteria for the selection of such priors. Our aim is to\nreview some of these criteria, compare their performance, and illustrate them\nwith some simple examples. While for very large sample sizes, it does not\npossibly matter what objective prior one uses, the selection of such a prior\ndoes influence inference for small or moderate samples. For regular models\nwhere asymptotic normality holds, Jeffreys' general rule prior, the positive\nsquare root of the determinant of the Fisher information matrix, enjoys many\noptimality properties in the absence of nuisance parameters. In the presence of\nnuisance parameters, however, there are many other priors which emerge as\noptimal depending on the criterion selected. One new feature in this article is\nthat a prior different from Jeffreys' is shown to be optimal under the\nchi-square divergence criterion even in the absence of nuisance parameters.

Nine of our\nsample clusters are located in the halo of M31 and the most remote one is out\nto a projected radius of 78.75 kpc from the galactic center. For all our sample\nclusters, we measured the Lick absorption-line indices and the radial\nvelocities. It is noted that most GCs of our sample are distinct from the HI\nrotation curve of M31 galaxy, especially for B514, MCGC5, H12 and B517,\nsuggesting that most of our sample clusters do not have kinematic association\nwith the star forming young disk of the galaxy.

Since the acceleration of particles and the\nproduction of radiation requires the presence of an electric field component\nparallel to the magnetic field, ${\\bf E}_\\parallel$, the structure of non-Ideal\npulsar magnetospheres is intimately related to the production of pulsar\nradiation. Therefore, knowledge of the structure of non-Ideal pulsar\nmagnetospheres is important because their comparison (including models for the\nproduction of radiation) with observations will delineate the physics and the\nparameters underlying the pulsar radiation problem.

With increased proximity to the uniform distribution the rate can\nbe arbitrarly slow, and in the limit, local uniqueness is lost.

The case-study is the\ncooperative relayed transmission from fixed indoor nodes to a common outdoor\naccess point. A stochastic bivariate model for the spatial distribution of the\nfading parameters that govern the link performance, namely the Rician K-factor\nand the path-loss, is proposed and validated by means of real channel\nmeasurements. The partner selection protocol is based on the real-time\nestimation of a function of these fading parameters, i.e., the coding gain. To\nreduce the complexity of the link quality assessment, a Bayesian approach is\nproposed that uses the site-specific bivariate model as a-priori information\nfor the coding gain estimation. This link quality estimator allows network\nlifetime gains almost as if all K-factor values were known. Furthermore, it\nsuits IEEE 802.15.4 compliant networks as it efficiently exploits the\ninformation acquired from the receiver signal strength indicator. Extensive\nnumerical results highlight the trade-off between complexity, robustness to\nmodel mismatches and network lifetime performance. We show for instance that\ninfrequent updates of the site-specific model through K-factor estimation over\na subset of links are sufficient to at least double the network lifetime with\nrespect to existing algorithms based on path loss information only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 12:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Researchers have developed elaborate \"value-added\nmodels\" of these longitudinal data to estimate the effects of educational\ninputs (e.g., teachers or schools) on student achievement while using prior\nachievement to adjust for nonrandom assignment of students to schools and\nclasses. A challenge to such modeling efforts is the extensive numbers of\nstudents with incomplete records and the tendency for those students to be\nlower achieving. These conditions create the potential for results to be\nsensitive to violations of the assumption that data are missing at random,\nwhich is commonly used when estimating model parameters. The current study\nextends recent value-added modeling approaches for longitudinal student\nachievement data Lockwood et al. [J. Educ. Behav.

We show that there is an empirical linear correlation between\nthe disk radius and the black hole mass. We demonstrate that such disks are\nnaturally formed by the partial capture of molecular clouds passing through the\ngalactic nucleus and temporarily engulfing the central supermassive black hole.\nImperfect cancellation of the angular momenta of the cloud material colliding\nafter passing on opposite sides of the hole leads to the formation of a compact\ndisk. The radial extent of the disk is determined by the efficiency of this\nprocess and the Bondi-Hoyle capture radius of the black hole, and naturally\nproduces the empirical linear correlation of the radial extent of the maser\ndistribution with black hole mass. The disk has sufficient column density to\nallow X-ray irradiation from the central source to generate physical and\nchemical conditions conducive to the formation of 22 GHz H2O masers. For\ninitial cloud column densities less than ~10^{23.5} cm^-2 the disk is non-self\ngravitating, consistent with the ordered kinematics of the edge-on megamaser\ndisks; for higher cloud columns the disk would fragment and produce a compact\nstellar disk similar to that observed around Sgr A* at the galactic centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 13:23:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 21:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Several such analyses have, however, quoted expressions for the\nspatial derivatives of the lensing potential in triaxial models, which are open\nto misinterpretation. In this paper, we give a clear description of weak\nlensing by triaxial NFW galaxy clusters and also present an efficient and\nrobust method to model these clusters and obtain parameter estimates. By\nconsidering four highly triaxial NFW galaxy clusters, we re-examine the impact\nof simplifying spherical assumptions and found that while the concentration\nestimates are largely unbiased except in one of our traixial NFW simulated\nclusters, for which the concentration is only slightly biased, the masses are\nsignificantly biased, by up to 40%, for all the clusters we analysed. Moreover,\nwe find that such assumptions can lead to the erroneous conclusion that some\nsubstructure is present in the galaxy clusters or, even worse, that multiple\ngalaxy clusters are present in the field.

Specifically, it seeks to understand when a singular symplectic\nquotient V/G of a symplectic vector space V by a group G \\subseteq Sp_2n(R) is\nrealizable as a Poisson subspace of some Poisson manifold (R^n,{.,.}).\n  The local embedding problem is recast in the language of schemes and\nreinterpreted as a problem of extending the Poisson bracket to infinitesimal\nneighborhoods of an embedded singular space. Such extensions of a Poisson\nbracket near a singular point p of V/G are then related to the cohomology and\nrepresentation theory of the cotangent Lie algebra at p.\n  Using this framework, it is shown that the real 4-dimensional quotient\nV/\\ZZ_n (n odd) is not realizable as a Poisson subspace of any\n(R^{2n+6},{.,.}), even though the underlying variety algebraically embeds into\nR^{2n+6}.

Dithering, as a method of data compression, can be used to\nconvert an 8-bit gray level image into a 1-bit / binary image. Undithering is\nthe process of reconstruction of gray image from binary image obtained from\ndithering of gray image. In the present paper, I propose a method of\nundithering using linear filtering followed by anisotropic diffusion which\nbrings the advantage of smoothing and edge enhancement. First-order statistical\nparameters, second-order statistical parameters, mean-squared error (MSE)\nbetween reconstructed image and the original image before dithering, and peak\nsignal to noise ratio (PSNR) are evaluated at each step of diffusion. Results\nof the experiments show that the reconstructed image is not as sharp as the\nimage before dithering but a large number of gray values are reproduced with\nreference to those of the original image prior to dithering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 15:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-17"}
