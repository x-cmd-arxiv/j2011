In this paper,\nwe intend to build a solid mathematical foundation to help better understand\nthe stochastic energy constraint and the inherent correlation between QoS and\nthe uncertain energy supply. We utilize a calculus approach to model the\ncumulative amount of charged energy and the cumulative amount of consumed\nenergy. We derive upper and lower bounds on the remaining energy level based on\na stochastic energy charging rate and a stochastic energy discharging rate. By\nbuilding the bridge between energy consumption and task execution (i.e.,\nservice), we study the QoS guarantee under the constraint of uncertain energy\nsources.

In this paper, we study the system in depth and reveal that\nthe B component itself is a binary and that the five stars HD 155448 A, B1, B2,\nC, and D likely form a comoving stellar system. From a spectroscopic analysis\nwe derive the spectral types and find that all components are B dwarfs (A: B1V,\nB1: B6V, B2: B9V, C: B4Ve, D: B8V). Their stellar ages put them close to the\nZAMS, and their distance is estimated to be ~2 kpc. Of particular interest is\nthe C component, which shows strong hydrogen and forbidden emission lines at\noptical wavelengths. All emission lines are spatially extended in the eastern\ndirection and appear to have a similar velocity shift, except for the [OI]\nline. In the IR images, we see an arc-like shape to the northeast of HD 155448\nC. From the optical up to 10 micron, most circumstellar emission is located at\ndistances between ~1.0 arcsec and 3.0 arcsec from HD 155448 C, while in the Q\nband the arc-like structure appears to be in contact with HD 155448 C.

We consider several scenarios to explain the\nunusual, asymmetric, arc-shaped geometry of the circumstellar matter. The most\nlikely explanation is an outflow colliding with remnant matter from the star\nformation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2011 17:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The probability of settlement is one of the quantitative characteristic\nof the settlement process. The probability of larval contact with a substrate\nis the upper bound of the probability of settlement. This work addresses the\nproblem of contact probability and contact rate of marine invertebrate larvae\nwith an isolated protruding collector located in an unbounded sea current.\nThere are two common approaches to the problem of contact probability. In one,\na collector induces certain cues, which help a larvae find the collector. In\nsuch a case, the larva moves towards the collector deliberately, using its\nnavigation and propulsion devices. In the second approach, a larva moves\ntowards a collector as a passive small particle. In this case, the cause of\ncontact of a larva with a collector is a mechanical collision of a small moving\nbody with a large obstacle. We considered a larva which does not know the\nlocation of the collector, which does not use its navigation device yet uses\nits self-propulsion. We mimicked a larva by a tiny self-propelled underwater\nvehicle, moving in shear flow of a large obstacle. We illustrated our approach\nby studying contact of a larva of the Bryozoan Bugula neritina with a\ncylindrical collector. We observed the behavior of this larva in a laboratory\nflume, and according to the observations formulated a mathematical model of\nlarval motion in shear flow. The trajectories of a large number of larvae,\nstarting their motion far from a collector with random initial conditions are\ncalculated numerically, and the probability of their contact with a collector\nis estimated. The results of Monte-Carlo simulations illustrate that larval\nself-propulsion may increase the probability of their contact with a collector\nby orders of magnitude compared to passive particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2011 17:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

To\ncharacterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct\nnumerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that\nend up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like\ndisk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may\nbelong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show\nthat field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's\nextreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge\nsometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the\nchance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ~20-30%\nof the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find\nits median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained\nduring the Sun's orbital history. The inner edge also shows a similar\ndependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellar\nencounters. Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of\nmagnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that\nassumes a fixed galactic environment. In addition, the amount of material\ntrapped in outer Oort Cloud orbits can be extremely low and may present\ndifficulties for models of Oort Cloud formation and long-period comet\nproduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2011 20:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-09"}

The storage medium\nis an ensemble of electron spins, coupled to a stripline cavity and an\nancillary readout system. Theoretical studies suggest that the system should be\ncapable of storing numerous qubits within the ensemble, and an experimental\nproof-of-concept has already been performed. Here we show that this minimal\narchitecture is not limited to storage but is in fact capable of full quantum\nprocessing by employing measurement-based entanglement. The technique appears\nto be remarkably robust against the anticipated dominant error types. The key\nenabling component, namely a readout technology that non-destructively\ndetermines \"are there n photons in the cavity?\", has already been realised\nexperimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 00:12:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 14:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-02"}

In\norder to counter anti-phishing technology, phishers change their mode of\noperation; therefore a continuous evaluation of phishing only helps us combat\nphisher effectiveness. In our study, we collected seven hundred thousand spam\nfrom a corporate server for a period of 13 months from February 2008 to\nFebruary 2009.

We believe that this study will develop more efficient\nanti-phishing methodologies. Based on our analysis, we developed an\nanti-phishing methodology and implemented in our network. The results show that\nthis approach is highly effective to prevent phishing attacks.

From July to October 2010, Virgo performed its\nthird science run (VSR3) in coincidence with the LIGO detectors. Despite\nseveral techniques adopted to isolate the interferometer from the environment,\nseismic noise remains an important issue for Virgo. Vibrations produced by the\ndetector infrastructure (such as air conditioning units, water\nchillers/heaters, pumps) are found to affect Virgo's sensitivity, with the main\ncoupling mechanisms being through beam jitter and scattered light processes.\nThe Advanced Virgo (AdV) design seeks to reduce ITF couplings to environmental\nnoise by having most vibration-sensitive components suspended and in-vacuum, as\nwell as muffle and relocate loud machines. During the months of June and July\n2010, a Guralp-3TD seismometer was stationed at various locations around the\nVirgo site hosting major infrastructure machines. Seismic data were examined\nusing spectral and coherence analysis with seismic probes close to the\ndetector. The primary aim of this study was to identify noisy machines which\nseismically affect the ITF environment and thus require mitigation attention.\nAnalyzed machines are located at various distances from the experimental halls,\nranging from 10m to 100m. An attempt is made to measure the attenuation of\nemitted noise at the ITF and correlate it to the distance from the source and\nto seismic attenuation models in soil.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 02:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-09"}

As a sequel of the first paper (Wada &\nShibata 2007), we carried out a three dimensional particle simulation for the\naxisymmetric global magnetosphere. We present the results of additional\ncalculations, which are higher resolution model and higher pair creation rate\ncases, and a detailed analysis for the solution. We confined to demonstrate the\ncases of low pair creation rate, i.e., the magnetic field is fixed dipole. The\nradiation drag of the plasma is taken in a form with the curvature radius along\nthe dipole magnetic field. The electrostatic interactions are calculated by a\nprogrammable special purpose computer, GRAPE-DR (Makino et al 2007). Once pair\ncreation is onset in the outer gaps, the both signed particles begin to drift\nacross the closed magnetic field due to radiation drag, and they create\noutflow. Eventually, the steady magnetosphere has outer gaps, both signed\noutflow of plasma and a region in which the electric field is dominant\nextending from the equator. In the steady state, the magnetic field made by\nmagnetospheric current is comparable to the dipole magnetic field outside of\nseveral light radii from the star. In much more pair creation rate model, the\neffect of modification of the magnetic field will bring about modification of\nthe outflow of the plasma, requiring further study with higher pair creation\nrate model in a subsequent paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 03:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Since selection acts on individuals\nwhose fitness depends on many loci, different loci affect each other's\ndynamics. This leads to stochastic fluctuations of allele frequencies above and\nbeyond genetic drift - an effect known as genetic draft. Since recombination\ndisrupts associations between alleles, draft is strong when recombination is\nrare. Here, we study a facultatively outcrossing population in a regime where\nthe frequency of out-crossing and recombination, r, is small compared to the\ncharacteristic scale of fitness differences \\sigma. In this regime, fit\ngenotypes expand clonally, leading to large fluctuations in the number of\nrecombinant offspring genotypes. The power law tail in the distribution of the\nlatter makes it impossible to capture the dynamics of draft by an effective\nneutral model. Instead, we find that the fixation time of a neutral allele\nincreases only slowly with the population size but depends sensitively on the\nratio r/\\sigma. The efficacy of selection is reduced dramatically and alleles\nbehave \"quasi-neutrally\" even for Ns>> 1, provided that |s|< s_c, where s_c\ndepends strongly on r/\\sigma, but only weakly on population size N.

Multipolar\nscalar polarizabilities are determined for the singly ionized calcium (Ca$^+$)\nand strontium (Sr$^+$) ions using the relativistic coupled-cluster method;\nthough the theory can be exercised for any single ion clock proposal. The\nexpected energy shifts for the respective clock transitions are estimated to be\n$4.38(3) \\times 10^{-4}$ Hz for Ca$^+$ and $9.50(7) \\times 10^{-5}$ Hz for\nSr$^+$.

A single and natural step turns this LRM into a quantum model\npredicting the correct probabilities. Intriguingly, the crucial step does\nobviously not modify locality but instead reality: What before could have still\nbeen a direct realism turns into modal realism.

The behaviour of the crowd is considered from a twofold perspective. We\nexamine both the large scale behaviour of the crowd, and phenomena happening at\nthe individual pedestrian's level. We unify micro and macro in a single model,\nby working with general mass measures and their transport. We improve existing\nmodelling by coupling a measure-theoretical framework with basic ideas of\nmixture theory formulated in terms of measures. This strategy allows us to\ndefine several constituents of the crowd, each having its own partial velocity.\nWe can thus examine the interaction between subpopulations that have distinct\ncharacteristics. We give special features to those pedestrians that are\nrepresented by the microscopic (discrete) part. In real life they would play\nthe role of leaders, predators etc. Since we are interested in the global\nbehaviour of the rest of the crowd, we model this part as a continuum. By\nidentifying a suitable concept of entropy, we derive an entropy inequality and\nshow that our model agrees with a Clausius-Duhem-like inequality. From this\ninequality natural restrictions on the proposed velocity fields follow; obeying\nthese restrictions makes our model compatible with thermodynamics. We prove\nexistence and uniqueness of a solution to a time-discrete transport problem for\ngeneral mass measures. Moreover, we show properties like positivity of the\nsolution and conservation of mass. Our results are valid for mass measures in\ntheir most general appearance. We give a robust scheme to approximate the\nsolution and illustrate numerically two-scale micro-macro behaviour. We\nexperiment with a number of scenarios, in order to capture the emergent\nqualitative behaviour. Finally, we formulate open problems and basic research\nquestions, inspired by our modelling, analysis and simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 11:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-09"}

Building on the compute-and-forward (C&F)\nrelaying strategy of Nazer and Gastpar, who demonstrated its asymptotic gain\nusing information-theoretic tools, an algebraic approach is taken to show its\npotential in practical, non-asymptotic, settings. A general framework is\ndeveloped for studying nested-lattice-based PNC schemes---called lattice\nnetwork coding (LNC) schemes for short---by making a direct connection between\nC&F and module theory. In particular, a generic LNC scheme is presented that\nmakes no assumptions on the underlying nested lattice code. C&F is\nre-interpreted in this framework, and several generalized constructions of LNC\nschemes are given. The generic LNC scheme naturally leads to a linear network\ncoding channel over modules, based on which non-coherent network coding can be\nachieved. Next, performance/complexity tradeoffs of LNC schemes are studied,\nwith a particular focus on hypercube-shaped LNC schemes. The error probability\nof this class of LNC schemes is largely determined by the minimum inter-coset\ndistances of the underlying nested lattice code. Several illustrative\nhypercube-shaped LNC schemes are designed based on Construction A and D,\nshowing that nominal coding gains of 3 to 7.5 dB can be obtained with\nreasonable decoding complexity. Finally, the possibility of decoding multiple\nlinear combinations is considered and related to the shortest independent\nvectors problem. A notion of dominant solutions is developed together with a\nsuitable lattice-reduction-based algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 13:08:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 13:25:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 19:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Near the chiral\nlimit, the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of pions, kaons, and nucleons\nare determined in terms of a few well-known parameters. In this limit, hadrons\nbecome quantum mechanically diffuse as polarizabilities scale with the inverse\nsquare-root of the quark mass. In some cases, however, such predictions from\nchiral perturbation theory have not compared well with experimental data.\nUltimately we must turn to first principles numerical simulations of QCD to\ndetermine properties of hadrons, and confront the predictions of chiral\nperturbation theory. To address the electromagnetic polarizabilities, we\nutilize the background field technique. Restricting our attention to\ncalculations in background electric fields, we demonstrate new techniques to\ndetermine electric polarizabilities and baryon magnetic moments for both\ncharged and neutral states. As we can study the quark mass dependence of\nobservables with lattice QCD, the lattice will provide a crucial test of our\nunderstanding of low-energy QCD, which will be timely in light of ongoing\nexperiments, such as at COMPASS and HI\\gamma S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 13:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Our analysis shows two\ndistinct regions for which the integral characteristics of both the giant and\npygmy resonances behave rather differently. For neutron-rich nuclei, starting\nfrom $^{132}$Sn, we obtain a giant E1 resonance which significantly deviates\nfrom the widely-used systematics extrapolated from experimental data in the\n$\\beta$-stability valley. We show that the inclusion of the phonon coupling is\nnecessary for a proper description of the low-energy pygmy resonances and the\ncorresponding transition densities for $A<$132 nuclei, while in the $A>132$\nregion the influence of phonon coupling is significantly smaller. The radiative\nneutron capture cross sections leading to the stable $^{124}$Sn and unstable\n$^{132}$Sn and $^{150}$Sn nuclei are calculated with both the (Q)RPA and the\nbeyond-(Q)RPA strength functions and shown to be sensitive to both the\npredicted low-lying strength and the phonon coupling contribution. The\ncomparison with the widely-used phenomenological Generalized Lorentzian\napproach shows considerable differences both for the strength function and the\nradiative neutron capture cross section. In particular, for the neutron-rich\n$^{150}$Sn, the reaction cross section is found to be increased by a factor\ngreater than 20.

This allows us to\nintegrate the Einstein equations (eqs) in very general forms with generic\noff--diagonal metrics depending on all spacetime coordinates via generating and\nintegration functions containing (un--)broken symmetry parameters. We associate\nfamilies of off-diagonal Einstein manifolds to certain classes of covariant\ngravity theories which have a nice ultraviolet behavior and seem to be (super)\nrenormalizable in a sense of covariant modifications of Horava-Lifshits\ngravity. The apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance is present in some\n\"partner\" anisotropically induced theories due to nonlinear coupling with\neffective parametric interactions determined by nonholonomic constraints and\ngeneric off-diagonal gravitational and matter fields configurations. Finally,\nwe show how the constructions can be extended to include exact solutions for\nconjectured covariant reonormalizable models with Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 11:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 13:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-18"}
