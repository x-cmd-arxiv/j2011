In such system the s-wave order parameter is coupled\ndifferently with different s+- gaps and it typically aligns with one of these\ngaps. This forces the other s+- gap to be anti-aligned with the s-wave gap. In\nsuch situation the aligned band induces a peak in the s-wave density of states\n(DoS), while the anti-aligned band induces a dip.

This\ntrend probably reflects more than a single process, however such a dependence\non the WD's temperature again favors a CS origin for a very large fraction of\nthose ion absorptions, previously observed with IUE, HST-STIS, HST-GHRS, FUSE,\nand now COS, selecting objects for which absorption line radial velocities,\nstellar effective temperature and photospheric velocity can be found in the\nliterature.

This is consistent with ubiquitous evaporation of\norbiting dusty material. Together with the fact that the fraction of stars with\n(red-or blue-) shifted lines and the fraction of stars known to possess heavy\nspecies in their atmosphere are of the same order, such a velocity-temperature\nrelationship is consistent with quasi-continuous evaporation of orbiting CS\ndusty material, followed by accretion and settling down in the photosphere. In\nview of these results, ion measurements close to the photospheric or the IS\nvelocity should be interpreted with caution, especially for stars at\nintermediate temperatures.

Even less is known experimentally\nabout the formation of ordered phases from such a quantum critical 'soup'.\nHere, we report a study of the specific heat across the phase diagram of the\nmodel system Sr3Ru2O7, which features an anomalous phase whose transport\nproperties are consistent with those of an electronic nematic.

SparseAssembler1 can\nsave as much as 90% memory consumption in comparison with the state-of-art\nassemblers, but it requires rounds of denoising to accurately assemble genomes.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new general model for genome assembly that uses\nonly sparse k-mers. The new model replaces the idea of the de Bruijn graph from\nthe beginning, and achieves similar memory efficiency and much better\nrobustness compared with our previous SparseAssembler1. Results: We demonstrate\nthat the decomposition of reads of all overlapping k-mers, which is used in\nexisting de Bruijn graph genome assemblers, is overly cautious. We introduce a\nsparse k-mer graph structure for saving sparse k-mers, which greatly reduces\nmemory space requirements necessary for de novo genome assembly. In contrast\nwith the de Bruijn graph approach, we devise a simple but powerful strategy,\ni.e., finding links between the k-mers in the genome and traversing following\nthe links, which can be done by saving only a few k-mers. To implement the\nstrategy, we need to only select some k-mers that may not even be overlapping\nones, and build the links between these k-mers indicated by the reads. We can\ntraverse through this sparse k-mer graph to build the contigs, and ultimately\ncomplete the genome assembly. Since the new sparse k-mers graph shares almost\nall advantages of de Bruijn graph, we are able to adapt a Dijkstra-like\nbreadth-first search algorithm to circumvent sequencing errors and resolve\npolymorphisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 19:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 19:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-10"}

The 2MASS observations,\nin particular, imply a mean cluster reddening of E(B-V)=1.45+-0.07 and a\ndistance of 2.94+-0.12 kpc. The reddening agrees with the UBV results provided\nthat the local reddening slope is described by E(U-B)/E(B-V)=0.64+-0.01, but\nthe distance estimates in the 2MASS and UBV systems agree only if the ratio of\ntotal-to-selective extinction for the associated dust is R=Av/E(B-V)=4.0+-0.1.\nBoth results are similar to what has been obtained for adjacent clusters in the\nEta Carinae region by similar analyses, which suggests that `anomalous' dust\nextinction is widespread through the region, particularly for groups reddened\nby relatively nearby dust. Dust associated with the Eta Carinae complex itself\nappears to exhibit more `normal' qualities.

As shown by Pinsker, under the peak\nenergy constraint, the best error exponent for communicating an M-ary message,\nM >= 3, with noise-free feedback is strictly larger than the one without\nfeedback. This paper extends Pinsker's result and shows that if the noise power\nin the feedback link is sufficiently small, the best error exponent for\nconmmunicating an M-ary message can be strictly larger than the one without\nfeedback. The proof involves two feedback coding schemes. One is motivated by a\ntwo-stage noisy feedback coding scheme of Burnashev and Yamamoto for binary\nsymmetric channels, while the other is a linear noisy feedback coding scheme\nthat extends Pinsker's noise-free feedback coding scheme. When the feedback\nnoise power $\\alpha$ is sufficiently small, the linear coding scheme\noutperforms the two-stage (nonlinear) coding scheme, and is asymptotically\noptimal as $\\alpha$ tends to zero.

In this\npaper, we consider the notion of recurrence over infinite partial words, that\nis, we study whether all of the finite subwords of a given infinite partial\nword appear infinitely often, and we establish connections between subword\ncomplexity and recurrence in this more general framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 03:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-19"}

It is well-understood how mesh geometry impacts finite\nelement interpolant quality, and leads to the reasonable notion of shape\nregular simplex meshes. It is also well-known how to perform both mesh\ngeneration and simplex subdivision, in arbitrary space dimension, so as to\nguarantee the entire hierarchy of nested simplex meshes produced through\nsubdivision continue to satisfy shape regularity. However, much more\nrestrictive angle conditions are needed for basic a priori quasi-optimal error\nestimates, as well as for a priori pointwise estimates. These angle conditions,\nwhich are particularly difficult to satisfy in three dimensions in any type of\nunstructured or adaptive setting, are needed to gain pointwise control of the\nnonlinearity through discrete maximum principles. This represents a major gap\nin finite element approximation theory for nonlinear problems on unstructured\nmeshes, and in particular for adaptive methods. In this article, we close this\ngap in the case of semilinear problems with critical or sub-critical nonlinear\ngrowth, by deriving a priori estimates directly, without requiring the discrete\nmaximum principle, and hence eliminating the need for restrictive angle\nconditions. Our main result is a type of local Lipschitz property that relies\nonly on the continuous maximum principle, together with the growth condition.\nWe also show that under some additional smoothness assumptions, the a priori\nerror estimate itself is enough to give pointwise control the discrete\nsolution, without the need for restrictive angle conditions.

From the spectra,\nsignal-to-noise ratios were calculated for a telescope such as the planned\nJames Webb Space Telescope.

Surface temperatures could be inferred for\nmodel scenarios with optically thin spectral windows. Dense, CO2-rich scenarios\ndid not allow for the characterization of surface temperatures and to assess\nhabitability. Degeneracies between CO2 concentration and surface pressure\nfurther complicated the interpretation of the calculated spectra, hence the\ndetermination of atmospheric conditions.

This\nassumption is challenged by the growing evidence from optical and X-ray\nobservations that the total baryon mass fraction increases towards rich\nclusters. In this context, we investigate the dependence of stellar, and total\nbaryon mass fractions as a function of mass. To do so, we used a subsample of\nnineteen clusters extracted from the X-ray flux limited sample HIFLUGCS that\nhave available DR-7 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. From the optical\nanalysis we derived the stellar masses. Using XMM-Newton we derived the gas\nmasses. Then, adopting a scaling relation we estimate the total masses. Adding\nthe gas and the stellar mass fractions we obtain the total baryonic content\nthat we find to increase with cluster mass, reaching 7-year Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP-7) prediction for clusters with M_500 = 1.6 x 10^{15}\nM_sun. We observe a decrease of the stellar mass fraction (from 4.5% to ~1.0%)\nwith increasing total mass where our findings for the stellar mass fraction\nagree with previous studies. This result suggests a difference in the number of\nstars formed per unit of halo mass, though with a large scatter for low-mass\nsystems. That is, the efficiency of star formation varies on cluster scale that\nlower mass systems are likely to have higher star formation efficiencies. It\nfollows immediately that the dependence of the stellar mass fraction on total\nmass results in an increase of the mass-to-light ratio from lower to higher\nmass systems.

This outflow phenomenon plays an important role in\nthe regulation of star formation. Understanding the associated shocks and their\nenergetic effects is therefore essential to the study of star formation. We\npresent comparisons of shock models with observations of H$_2$ and SiO emission\nin the bipolar outflow BHR71, and predict water emission, under the basic\nassumption that the emission regions of the considered species coincide, at the\nresolution of currently available observations. New SiO observations from APEX\nare presented, and combined with \\textit{Spitzer} and ground-based observations\nof H$_2$ to constrain shock models. The shock regions associated with targeted\npositions in the molecular outflow are studied by means of a 1D code that\ngenerates models of the propagation of stationary shock waves, and\napproximations to non-stationary ones. The SiO emission in the inner part of\nthe outflow is concentrated near the apex of the corresponding bow-shock that\nis also seen in the pure rotational transitions of H$_2$. Simultaneous\nmodelling is possible for H$_2$ and SiO and leads to constraints on the silicon\npre-shock distribution on the grain mantles and/or cores. The best-fitting\nmodels are found to be of the non-stationary type, but the degeneracy of the\nsolutions is still large.

The steady state\nprobability distributions of protein levels and the mean first passage times\nare computed for different noise strengths and system parameters. In the region\nof bistability, the bimodal probability distribution is shown to be a linear\ncombination of a lognormal and a Gaussian distribution. The variances of the\nindividual distributions and the relative weights of the distributions are\nfurther calculated for varying noise strengths and system parameters. The\nexperimental relevance of the model results is also pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 11:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 09:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-22"}

Aims: To test the predictions of the Seyfert\nunification scheme, we make statistical comparison of the distributions of: (i)\nthe absorption-corrected 2.0 - 10 keV X-ray luminosities, (ii) the bolometric\nluminosities, (iii) the black hole masses and, (iv) the Eddington ratios, of\nSeyfert type 1s and type 2s.

A distinctive feature of DPQ is that it\nfacilitates a seamless transition between signal synthesis and quantization. A\ntheoretical analysis of DPQ leads to a distribution preserving rate-distortion\nfunction (DP-RDF), which serves as a lower bound on the rate of any DPQ scheme,\nunder a constraint on distortion. In general situations, the DP-RDF approaches\nthe classic rate-distortion function for the same source and distortion\nmeasure, in the limit of an increasing rate. A practical DPQ scheme based on a\nmultivariate transformation is also proposed. This scheme asymptotically\nachieves the DP-RDF for i.i.d.

We introduce a distributed channel state information (DCSI)\nmodel where each TX has its own local estimate of the overall multi-user MIMO\nchannel and must make a precoding decision solely based on the available local\nCSI. We refer to this channel as the DCSI-MIMO channel and the precoding\nproblem as distributed precoding. We extend to the DCSI setting the work from\nJindal for the conventional MIMO Broadcast Channel (BC) in which the number of\nDegrees of Freedom (DoFs) achieved by Zero Forcing (ZF) was derived as a\nfunction of the scaling in the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of\nthe number of quantizing bits. Particularly, we show the seemingly pessimistic\nresult that the number of DoFs at each user is limited by the worst CSI across\nall users and across all TXs. This is in contrast to the conventional MIMO BC\nwhere the number of DoFs at one user is solely dependent on the quality of the\nestimation of his own feedback. Consequently, we provide precoding schemes\nimproving on the achieved number of DoFs. For the two-user case, the derived\nnovel precoder achieves a number of DoFs limited by the best CSI accuracy\nacross the TXs instead of the worst with conventional ZF. We also advocate the\nuse of hierarchical quantization of the CSI, for which we show that\nconsiderable gains are possible.

The two dominant processes are; the photo-dissociation of H_2\nmolecules in the Werner and Lyman bands, and the emission of photo-electrons\nfrom dust grains when high energy photons are absorbed. Photo-electrons are an\nimportant source of gas heating. Dust grain charging when exposed to various\npossible UV fields in the YSOs environment is investigated. Numerical\nsimulation of the evolution of photo-electrons in the electric field created by\nthe charged dust grains are carried out to obtain a charging profile. From the\nsimulations it appears that the different spectra produce significant\nquantitative and qualitative different charging processes. Both the UV\nbackground and the Ae-Herbig star radiation field produce a relatively slow\ncharging of dust grains due to the low fraction of sufficiently energetic\nphotons. The radiation field of T Tauri Stars (TTSs) is harder due to the\nrelease of magnetic energy in the dense magnetospheric environment. These\nnumerical results have been used to propose a new simple analytical model for\ngrain charging in the atmosphere of protostellar disks around TTSs susceptible\nto be used in any disk modeling. It has been found that the yield decreases\nexponentially with the dust charge and that two populations of photoelectrons\nare produced. The high energy population is susceptible of dissociating the H_2\nand ionizing some low ionization potential species, such as the Mg. These\nresults add an additional role to dust on the chemistry of the layers just\nbelow the H_2 photoionization front.

Here, the designed activity emerges from\ncollective effects of singular components equipped with limited individual\nfunctionality. Top-down fabrication of plasmonic materials with a predesigned\noptical response in the visible range by conventional lithographic methods has\nremained challenging due to their limited resolution, the complexity of\nscaling, and the difficulty to extend these techniques to three-dimensional\narchitectures. Molecular self-assembly provides an alternative route to create\nsuch materials which is not bound by the above limitations. We demonstrate how\nthe DNA origami method can be used to produce plasmonic materials with a\ntailored optical response at visible wavelengths. Harnessing the assembly power\nof 3D DNA origami, we arranged metal nanoparticles with a spatial accuracy of 2\nnm into nanoscale helices. The helical structures assemble in solution in a\nmassively parallel fashion and with near quantitative yields. As a designed\noptical response, we generated giant circular dichroism and optical rotary\ndispersion in the visible range that originates from the collective\nplasmon-plasmon interactions within the nanohelices. We also show that the\noptical response can be tuned through the visible spectrum by changing the\ncomposition of the metal nanoparticles. The observed effects are independent of\nthe direction of the incident light and can be switched by design between left-\nand right-handed orientation.

It is well-known that the\nperformance of scheduling over fading channels relies heavily on the accuracy\nof the available Channel State Information (CSI), which is costly to acquire.\nThus, we consider the CSI acquisition via a practical ARQ-based feedback\nmechanism whereby channel states are revealed at the end of only scheduled\nusers' transmissions. In the assumed presence of temporally-correlated channel\nevolutions, the desired scheduler must optimally balance the\nexploitation-exploration trade-off, whereby it schedules transmissions both to\nexploit those channels with up-to-date CSI and to explore the current state of\nthose with outdated CSI.\n  In earlier works, Whittle's Index Policy had been suggested as a\nlow-complexity and high-performance solution to this problem. However,\nanalyzing its performance in the typical scenario of statistically\nheterogeneous channel state processes has remained elusive and challenging,\nmainly because of the highly-coupled and complex dynamics it possesses. In this\nwork, we overcome these difficulties to rigorously establish the asymptotic\noptimality properties of Whittle's Index Policy in the limiting regime of many\nusers. More specifically: (1) we prove the local optimality of Whittle's Index\nPolicy, provided that the initial state of the system is within a certain\nneighborhood of a carefully selected state; (2) we then establish the global\noptimality of Whittle's Index Policy under a recurrence assumption that is\nverified numerically for our problem.

The measured cross section is 150 +/- 9 (stat.) +/- 17\nsyst.) +/- 6 (lumi.) pb and is in agreement with higher-order QCD calculations.\nThe combination of this measurement with a previous CMS result based on\ndileptons gives 154 +/- 17 (stat.+syst.) +/- 6 (lumi.) pb.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 15:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

Though, it has been observed that Fearnley's example\nleaves open the possibility that PI behaves well in many particular cases, such\nas in problems that involve a fixed discount factor, or that are restricted to\ndeterministic actions. In this paper, we analyze a large class of MDPs and we\nargue that PI is efficient in that case.
