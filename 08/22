In this\npaper we study stability properties of a class of structurally stable\nheteroclinic cycles in R^n which we call heteroclinic cycles of type Z. It is\nwell-known that a heteroclinic cycle that is not asymptotically stable can\nattract nevertheless a positive measure set from its neighbourhood. We say that\nan invariant set X is fragmentarily asymptotically stable, if for any delta>0\nthe measure of its local basin of attraction B_delta(X) is positive. A local\nbasin of attraction B_delta(X) is the set of such points that trajectories\nstarting there remain in the delta-neighbourhood of X for all t>0, and are\nattracted by X as t\\to\\infty. Necessary and sufficient conditions for\nfragmentary asymptotic stability are expressed in terms of eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of transition matrices.

It is shown that, contrary to common intuition,\nrotation of the trap containing a spin-orbit condensate does not lead to an\nequilibrium state with static vortex structures, but gives rise instead to\nnon-equilibrium behavior described by an intrinsically time-dependent\nHamiltonian. We propose here the following alternative methods to induce\nthermodynamically stable static vortex configurations: (1) to rotate both the\nlasers and the anisotropic trap; and (2) to impose a synthetic Abelian field on\ntop of synthetic spin-orbit interactions. Effective Hamiltonians for spin-orbit\ncondensates under such perturbations are derived for most currently known\nrealistic laser schemes that induce synthetic spin-orbit couplings. The\nGross-Pitaevskii equation is solved for several experimentally relevant\nregimes. The new interesting effects include spatial separation of left- and\nright-moving spin-orbit condensates, the appearance of unusual vortex\narrangements, and parity effects in vortex nucleation where the topological\nexcitations are predicted to appear in pairs. All these phenomena are shown to\nbe highly non-universal and depend strongly on a specific laser scheme and\nsystem parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2011 20:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

At the first stage, the permissible intervals of primary nuclei\nfractions f_i are determined on the base of the EAS spectrum vs the total\nnumber of muons (E_mu > 235 GeV). At the second stage, the permissible\nintervals of f_i are narrowed by fitting procedure. We use the experimental\ndata on high multiplicity muon events (n_mu > 114) collected at the Baksan\nunderground scintillation telescope. Within the framework of three components\n(protons, helium and heavy nuclei), the mass composition in the region\n10^15-10^16 eV has been defined: f_p = 0.235 +- 0.02, f_He = 0.290 +- 0.02$,\nf_H = 0.475 +- 0.03.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 07:48:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 09:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We wish to quantify the respective\nrole of these two modes of accretion, which could determine the morphological\ntypes of galaxies observed today. Multi-zoom cosmological simulations are used\nto estimate as a function of time the evolution of mass in bound systems, for\ndark matter as well as baryons. The baryonic contents of dark matter haloes are\nstudied. Merger histories are followed as a function of external density, and\nthe different ways in which mass is assembled in galaxies and the stellar\ncomponent accumulated are quantified. We find that most galaxies assemble their\nmass through smooth accretion, and only the most massive galaxies also grow\nsignificantly through mergers. The mean fraction of mass assembled by accretion\nis 77 %, and by mergers 23 %. We present typical accretion histories of\nhundreds of galaxies: masses of the most massive galaxies increase\nmonotonically in time, mainly through accretion, many intermediate-mass objects\nalso experience mass-loss events such as tidal stripping and evaporation.\nHowever, our simulations suffer from the overcooling of massive galaxies caused\nby the neglect of active galaxy nuclei (AGN) feedback. The time by which half\nof the galay mass has assembled, both in dark matter and baryons, is a\ndecreasing function of mass, which is compatible with the observations of a\nso-called downsizing.

Among the resonances, the predominant contribution comes from\nthe $\\Delta(1232)$, which determines both the direct decay channel $R\n\\rightarrow N e^+ e^-$ and the pion decay channel. In the collisions $np\n\\rightarrow e^+ e^- X$, additional significant contributions arise from the\n$\\eta$-meson Dalitz decays, produced in the $np \\rightarrow np\\eta$ and $np\n\\rightarrow d\\eta$ reactions, the radiative capture $np \\rightarrow d e^+ e^-$,\nand the $np \\rightarrow np e^+ e^-$ bremsstrahlung. These mechanisms may partly\nexplain the strong excess of dileptons in the cross section for collisions of\n$np$ versus $pp$, which ranges from 7 to 100 times for the dilepton invariant\nmasses of 0.2 to 0.5 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 10:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

If the system comprises a massive\nstar and a young non-accreting pulsar, their winds will collide producing\nbroadband non-thermal emission, most likely originated in the shocked pulsar\nwind. Thermal X-ray emission is expected from the shocked stellar wind, but\nuntil now it has neither been detected nor studied in the context of gamma-ray\nbinaries. We present a semi-analytic model of the thermal X-ray emission from\nthe shocked stellar wind in pulsar gamma-ray binaries, and find that the\nthermal X-ray emission increases monotonically with the pulsar spin-down\nluminosity, reaching luminosities of the order of 10^33 erg/s. The lack of\nthermal features in the X-ray spectrum of gamma-ray binaries can then be used\nto constrain the properties of the pulsar and stellar winds. By fitting the\nobserved X-ray spectra of gamma-ray binaries with a source model composed of an\nabsorbed non-thermal power law and the computed thermal X-ray emission, we are\nable to derive upper limits on the spin-down luminosity of the putative pulsar.\nWe applied this method to LS 5039, the only gamma-ray binary with a radial,\npowerful wind, and obtain an upper limit on the pulsar spin-down luminosity of\n~6x10^36 erg/s. Given the energetic constraints from its high-energy gamma-ray\nemission, a non-thermal to spin-down luminosity ratio very close to unity may\nbe required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 10:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 13:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

The\nvalue of the topological Hausdorff dimension is always between the topological\ndimension and the Hausdorff dimension, in particular, this new dimension is a\nnon-trivial lower estimate for the Hausdorff dimension.\n  We examine the basic properties of this new notion of dimension, compare it\nto other well-known notions, determine its value for some classical fractals\nsuch as the Sierpinski carpet, the von Koch snowflake curve, Kakeya sets, the\ntrail of the Brownian motion, etc.\n  As our first application, we generalize the celebrated result of Chayes,\nChayes and Durrett about the phase transition of the connectedness of the limit\nset of Mandelbrot's fractal percolation process. They proved that certain\ncurves show up in the limit set when passing a critical probability, and we\nprove that actually `thick' families of curves show up, where roughly speaking\nthe word thick means that the curves can be parametrized in a natural way by a\nset of large Hausdorff dimension. The proof of this is basically a lower\nestimate of the topological Hausdorff dimension of the limit set. For the sake\nof completeness, we also give an upper estimate and conclude that in the\nnon-trivial cases the topological Hausdorff dimension is almost surely strictly\nbelow the Hausdorff dimension.\n  Finally, as our second application, we show that the topological Hausdorff\ndimension is precisely the right notion to describe the Hausdorff dimension of\nthe level sets of the generic continuous function (in the sense of Baire\ncategory) defined on a compact metric space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 12:41:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 13:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 02:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

The Halpha luminosity of the LBV star is by one\norder of magnitude higher than the one obtained for the LBV star in NGC\n2363=Mrk 71 which has a slightly higher metallicity 12+logO/H = 7.87.

Aims: We determine the\npresent-day mass function of the Quintuplet cluster, a young massive cluster in\nthe vicinity of the Galactic centre. Methods: We use two epochs of high\nresolution near infrared imaging data obtained with NAOS/CONICA at the ESO VLT\nto measure the individual proper motions of stars in the Quintuplet cluster in\nthe cluster reference frame. An unbiased sample of cluster members within a\nradius of 0.5 pc from the cluster centre was established based on their common\nmotion with respect to the field and a subsequent colour-cut. Initial stellar\nmasses were inferred from four isochrones covering ages from 3 to 5 Myr and two\nsets of stellar evolution models. For each isochrone the present-day mass\nfunction of stars was determined for the full sample of main sequence cluster\nmembers using an equal number binning scheme. Results: We find the slope of the\npresent-day mass function in the central part of the Quintuplet cluster to be\nalpha = -1.66+-0.14 for an approximate mass range from 5 to 40M_Sun, which is\nsignificantly flatter than the Salpeter slope of alpha = -2.35.

The 2H/4He and 3He/4He ratios probe a\ndifferent Z/A regime, therefore testing the `universality' of propagation. We\nrevisit the constraints on diffusion-model parameters set by the quartet (1H,\n2H, 3He, 4He), using the most recent data as well as updated formulae for the\ninelastic and production cross-sections. The analysis relies on the USINE\npropagation package and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to estimate the\nprobability density functions of the parameters. Simulated data are also used\nto validate analysis strategies. The fragmentation of CNO cosmic rays (resp.\nNeMgSiFe) on the ISM during their propagation contributes to 20% (resp. 20%) of\nthe 2H and 15% (resp. 10%) of the 3He flux at high energy. The C to Fe elements\nare also responsible for up to 10% of the 4He flux measured at 1 GeV/n. The\nanalysis of 3He/4He (and to a less extent 2H/4He) data shows that the transport\nparameters are consistent with those from the B/C analysis: the diffusion model\nwith delta~0.7 (diffusion slope), Vc~20 km/s (galactic wind), Va~40 km/s\n(reacceleration) is favoured, but the combination delta~0.2, Vc~0, and Va~80\nkm/s is a close second. The confidence intervals on the parameters show that\nthe constraints set by the quartet data are competitive with those brought by\nthe B/C data. These constraints are tighter when adding the 3He (or 2H) flux\nmeasurements, and the tightest when further adding the He flux. For the latter,\nthe analysis of simulated and real data show an increased sensitivity to\nbiases. Using secondary-to-primary ratio along with a loose prior on the source\nparameters is recommended to get the most robust constraints on the transport\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 15:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-01"}

Our results disagree with previous findings. While we also\nobserve that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower driving neutrino\nluminosity than spherically symmetric (1D) models, we do not find that\nexplosions in 3D occur easier and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that\nthe average entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the dimension\nand thus is no good diagnostic quantity for the readiness to explode. Instead,\nmass, integrated entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and nonradial kinetic\nenergy in the gain layer are higher when models are closer to explosion.\nCoherent, large-scale mass motions as typically associated with the standing\naccretion-shock instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for explosions\nbecause they drive strong shock expansion and thus enlarge the gain layer.\nWhile 2D models with better angular resolution explode clearly more easily, the\nopposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a consequence of the\nturbulent energy cascade, which transports energy from small to large spatial\nscales in 2D, thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow in 3D\nis in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation and vortex motions on\nsmaller scales and thus making the 3D evolution with finer grid resolution more\nsimilar to 1D. More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may therefore be\ntightly linked to efficient growth of low-order SASI modes including\nnonaxisymmetric ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 15:40:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 18:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This entails the exciting possibility of\ncontrolling the conductance of a device by direct manipulation of the electron\nwave function. Such control has been most clearly demonstrated in mesoscopic\nsemiconductor structures at low temperatures. Indeed, the Aharanov-Bohm effect,\nconductance quantization and universal conductance fluctuations are direct\nmanifestations of the electron wave nature. However, an extension of this\nconcept to more practical emperatures has not been achieved so far. As\nmolecules are nano-scale objects with typical energy level spacings (~eV) much\nlarger than the thermal energy at 300 K (~25 meV), they are natural candidates\nto enable such a break-through. Fascinating phenomena including giant\nmagnetoresistance, Kondo effects and conductance switching, have previously\nbeen demonstrated at the molecular level. Here, we report direct evidence for\ndestructive quantum interference in charge transport through two-terminal\nmolecular junctions at room temperature. Furthermore, we show that the degree\nof interference can be controlled by simple chemical modifications of the\nmolecule. Not only does this provide the experimental demonstration of a new\nphenomenon in quantum charge transport, it also opens the road for a new type\nof molecular devices based on chemical or electrostatic control of quantum\ninterference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 15:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
