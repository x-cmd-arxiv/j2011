While this can be attributed\nto the superposition of multiple typical flares, we explore the possibility\nthat the time-variable eclipsing of flares by their host stars may also be an\nimportant factor. We assume each flare is contained within a single, uniform\nplasma density magnetic loop and specify the intrinsic variation of the flare's\nemission measure with time. We consider rotational eclipse by the star itself,\nbut also by circumstellar discs and flare-associated prominences. Based on this\nsimple model, we generate a set of flares similar to those observed in the COUP\ndatabase. Many eclipses simply reduce the flare's maximum emission measure or\ndecay time. We conclude therefore that eclipses often pass undetected, but\nusually have only a modest influence on the flare emission measure profile and\nhence the derived loop lengths. We show that eclipsing can easily reproduce the\nobserved atypical flare morphologies. The number of atypical modelled flare\nmorphologies is however much less than that found in the COUP sample. The large\nnumber of observed atypical flare morphologies, therefore, must be attributed\nto other processes such as multiple flaring loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 16:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Such a transition is triggered by\nvortices crossing the thin film superconducting strip from one edge to another\ndue to the Lorentz force. Detector counts in SNSPDs may be caused by three\nprocesses: (a) a single incident photon with energy sufficient to break enough\nCooper pairs to create a normal-state belt across the entire width of the strip\n(direct photon count), (b) thermally induced single-vortex crossing in the\nabsence of photons (dark count), which at high bias currents releases the\nenergy sufficient to trigger the transition to the normal state in a belt\nacross the whole width of the strip, and (c) a single incident photon with\ninsufficient energy to create a normal-state belt but initiating a subsequent\nsingle-vortex crossing, which provides the rest of the energy needed to create\nthe normal-state belt (vortex-assisted single photon count). We derive the\ncurrent dependence of the rate of vortex-assisted photon counts. The resulting\nphoton count rate has a plateau at high currents close to the critical current\nand drops as a power-law with high exponent at lower currents. While the\nmagnetic field perpendicular to the film plane does not affect the formation of\nhot spots by photons, it causes the rate of vortex crossings (with or without\nphotons) to increase. We show that by applying a magnetic field one may\ncharacterize the energy barrier for vortex crossings and identify the origin of\ndark counts and vortex-assisted photon counts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 16:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 01:22:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 18:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The two\nabove conditions are the well known flat rotation curves and Tully-Fisher\nrelations of the galactic regime. Recently however, a similar phenomenology has\nbeen hinted at, at the outskirts of Galactic globular clusters, precisely in\nthe region where $a<a_{0}$. Radial profiles of the projected velocity\ndispersion have been observed to stop decreasing along Keplerian expectations,\nand to level off at constant values beyond the radii where $a<a_{0}$.

Since Newman's suggestion of using \\emph{modularity} as a\nmeasure to qualify the goodness of community structures, many efficient methods\nto maximize modularity have been proposed but without a guarantee of\noptimality.

After the dynamical phase of the\nmerger, magnetic stresses rapidly redistribute angular momentum, leading to\nnearly solid-body rotation on a viscous timescale of 1e-4 to 1 yr, long before\nsignificant cooling can occur. Due to heating during the dynamical and viscous\nphases, the less massive WD is transformed into a hot, slowly rotating, and\nradially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure.\n  Following the viscous phase of evolution, the maximum temperature near the\nenvelope base may already be high enough to begin off-center convective\ncarbon-burning. If not, Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the inner region of the\nenvelope on a thermal timescale of 1e3-1e4 yr compresses the base of the\nenvelope, again yielding off-center burning. As a result, the long-term\nevolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previous\ncalculations: the burning shell diffuses inwards over ~1e4 yr, eventually\nyielding a high-mass O/Ne WD or a collapse to a neutron star. During the\ncooling and shell-burning phases, the merger remnant radiates near the\nEddington limit. Given the double WD merger rate of a few per 1000 yr, tens of\nthese ~1e38 erg/s sources should exist in a Milky Way-type galaxy.\n  While the end result is similar to that of previous studies, the physical\npicture and the dynamical state of the matter in our model differ from previous\nwork. Furthermore, remaining uncertainties related to the convective structure\nnear the photosphere and mass loss during the thermal evolution may\nsignificantly affect our conclusions. Thus, future work within the context of\nthe physical model presented here is required to better address the eventual\nfate of double WD mergers, including those for which one or both of the\ncomponents is a He WD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 01:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This is\nparticularly of concern in intermittent encounter-based mobile networks which\nare already delay-limited due to the sparse and highly dynamic network\nconnectivity. While state of the art mechanisms for such networks have proposed\nthe use of redundant transmissions to improve delay, they do not work well when\nthe traffic load is high. We propose in this paper a novel hybrid approach that\nwe refer to as backpressure with adaptive redundancy (BWAR), which provides the\nbest of both worlds. This approach is highly robust and distributed and does\nnot require any prior knowledge of network load conditions. We evaluate BWAR\nthrough both mathematical analysis and simulations based on cell-partitioned\nmodel. We prove theoretically that BWAR does not perform worse than traditional\nbackpressure in terms of the maximum throughput, while yielding a better delay\nbound. The simulations confirm that BWAR outperforms traditional backpressure\nat low load, while outperforming a state of the art encounter-routing scheme\n(Spray and Wait) at high load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 22:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The visual psychophysics literature has demonstrated the importance\nof interdependence among parts of the scene. Yet, the majority of methods in\ncomputer vision remain local. Pictorial structures have arisen as a fundamental\nparts-based model for some vision problems, such as articulated object\ndetection. However, the form of classical pictorial structures limits their\napplicability for global problems, such as semantic pixel labeling. In this\npaper, we propose an extension of the pictorial structures approach, called\npixel-support parts-sparse pictorial structures, or PS3, to overcome this\nlimitation. Our model extends the classical form in two ways: first, it defines\nparts directly based on pixel-support rather than in a parametric form, and\nsecond, it specifies a space of plausible parts-based scene models and permits\none to be used for inference on any given image. PS3 makes strides toward\nunifying object-level and pixel-level modeling of scene elements. In this\nreport, we implement the first half of our model and rely upon external\nknowledge to provide an initial graph structure for a given image. Our\nexperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the capability of this\nnew parts-based view of scene modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2011 02:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-23"}

We use operator and functional integral methods\nfrom reaction-diffusion theory to solve for the phase structure, noise\nspectrum, and escape trajectories and first-passage times of a class of minimal\nmodels of switches, showing how all critical properties for switch behavior can\nbe computed within a unified framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2011 15:36:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 22:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Many different operator algebras exist for example for a theory of\nquantum mechanics. In Loop Quantum Gravity only two algebras have been\nintroduced until now. In the project about 'Algebras of Quantum Variables (AQV)\nfor LQG' the known holonomy-flux *-algebra and the Weyl C*-algebra will be\nmodified and a set of new algebras will be proposed and studied. The idea of\nthe construction of these algebras is to establish a finite set of operators,\nwhich generates (in the sense of Woronowicz, Schm\\\"udgen and Inoue) the\ndifferent O*- or C*-algebras of quantum gravity and to use inductive limits of\nthese algebras. In the Loop Quantum Gravity approach usually the basic\nclassical variables are connections and fluxes. Studying the three constraints\nappearing in the canonical quantisation of classical general relativity in the\nADM-formalism some other variables like curvature appear. Consequently the main\ndifficulty of a quantisation of gravity is to find a suitable replacement of\nthe set of elementary classical variables and constraints. The algebra of\nquantum gravity is supposed to be generated by a set of the operators\nassociated to holonomies, fluxes and in some cases even the curvature. There\nare two reasonable choices for this algebra: The set of constraints of Quantum\nGravity are contained in or at least the constraints are affilliated with this\nalgebra. Secondly, the algebra of quantum variables is said to be physical if\nit contains complete observables. In the project of 'Algebras of Quantum\nVariables for LQG' different algebras will be studied with respect to the\nproperty of being a physical algebra. Furthermore the existence of KMS-states\non these algebras will be argued.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 16:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-24"}
