The buffer is modeled as an M/M/1 queue, plus the consideration of\nbursty arrivals. When the buffer is empty, the service restarts after a certain\namount of packets are \\emph{prefetched}. With this goal, we propose two\napproaches to obtain the \\emph{exact distribution} of the number of buffer\nstarvations, one of which is based on \\emph{Ballot theorem}, and the other uses\nrecursive equations. The Ballot theorem approach gives an explicit result. We\nextend this approach to the scenario with a constant playback rate using\nT\\`{a}kacs Ballot theorem. The recursive approach, though not offering an\nexplicit result, can obtain the distribution of starvations with\nnon-independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) arrival process in which\nan ON/OFF bursty arrival process is considered in this work. We further compute\nthe starvation probability as a function of the amount of prefetched packets\nfor a large number of files via a fluid analysis. Among many potential\napplications of starvation analysis, we show how to apply it to optimize the\nobjective quality of experience (QoE) of media streaming, by exploiting the\ntradeoff between startup/rebuffering delay and starvations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2011 16:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2012 21:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 11:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 14:19:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 10:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Specifically, we give high-priority to the\nenergy-constrained source-destination pair, i.e., primary pair, and\nlow-priority to the pair which is free from such constraint, i.e., secondary\npair. In contrast to the traditional notion of cognitive radio, in which the\nsecondary transmitter is required to relinquish the channel as soon as the\nprimary is detected, the secondary transmitter not only utilizes the idle slots\nof primary pair but also transmits along with the primary transmitter with\nprobability $p$. This is possible because we consider the general multi-packet\nreception model.

While IGR J11215$-$5952,\nIGR J16465$-$4507, and IGR J18483$-$0311 may have magnetic fields (up to a few\n$10^{11}-10^{12}$ G) similar to those of normal X-ray pulsars, the magnetic\nfield of AX J1841.0$-$0536 is considerably low ($\\la 10^{10}$ G). The high-mass\ncompanion stars in SFXTs implies that the neutron stars are relatively young\nobjects, with age less than $\\sim 10^7$ yr. Analysis of the spin evolution\nshows that neutron stars like AX J1841.0$-$0536 should be born with relatively\nlong spin periods ($\\la 1$ s). Considering the fact that among the four SFXTs\nonly AX J1841.0$-$0536 is a \"proper\" one, and the other three are either\n\"intermediate\" SFXTs or have peculiar characteristics, we suggest that the\nneutron stars in some of SFXTs may have similar characteristics as several\nyoung central compact objects in supernova remnants called \"anti-magnetars\".\nThese features, combining with accretion from clumpy winds, could make them\ndistinct from standard supergiant X-ray binaries -- the low fields and\nrelatively long spin periods guarantee accretion at very low level, resulting\nin a large dynamic range ($10^4-10^5$) of X-ray luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 03:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Using as a starting point any linear\nEEG tomography that satisfies the EEG forward equation, it is shown that the\ngeneralized partial coherences for the cortical grey matter current density\ntime series are invariant to the selected tomography.

Both effects\ncontribute to spin relaxation limited by the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism. In\naddition, the random Rashba field also causes spin relaxation by spin-flip\nscattering, manifesting itself as an Elliott-Yafet--like mechanism.

One of the\nimportant parameters is the intrinsic, or local, velocity dispersion of a\ngalaxy, which allows one to quantify the degree of non-circular motions such as\npressure support. However, this is difficult to measure because the observed\ndispersion includes the effects of (often severe) beam smearing on the velocity\ngradient. Here we investigate four methods of measuring the dispersion that\nhave been used in the literature, to assess their effectiveness at recovering\nthe intrinsic dispersion. We discuss the biasses inherent in each method, and\napply them to model disk galaxies in order to determine which methods yield\nmeaningful quantities, and under what conditions. All the mean weighted\ndispersion estimators are affected by (residual) beam smearing. In contrast,\nthe dispersion recovered by fitting a spatially and spectrally convolved disk\nmodel to the data is unbiassed by the beam smearing it is trying to compensate.\nBecause of this, and because the bias it does exhibit depends only on the\nsignal-to-noise, it can be considered reliable. However, at very low\nsignal-to-noise, all methods should be used with caution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 11:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We\nfirst consider a collision between two test particles following the radial\ngeodesics in the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m naked singular geometry. An initially\nradially ingoing particle turns back due to the repulsive effect of gravity in\nthe vicinity of naked singularity. Such a particle then collides with an\nanother radially ingoing particle. We show that the center of mass energy of\ncollision taking place at $r \\approx M$ is unbound, in the limit where the\ncharge transcends the mass by arbitrarily small amount $0<1-M/Q\\ll1$.The\nacceleration process we described avoids fine tuning of the parameters of the\nparticle geodesics for the unbound center of mass energy of collisions and the\nproper time required for the process is also finite. We show that the\ncoordinate time required for the trans-Plankian collision to occur around one\nsolar mass naked singularity is around million years while it is many orders of\nmagnitude larger than Hubble time in the black hole case. We then study the\ncollision of the neutral spherically symmetric shells made up of dust\nparticles. In this case, it is possible to treat the situation by exactly\ntaking into account the gravity due to the shells using Israel`s thin shell\nformalism, and thus this treatment allows us to go beyond the test particle\napproximation. The center of mass energy of collision of the shells is then\ncalculated in a situation analogous to the test particle case and is shown to\nbe bounded above. However, we find thatthe energy of a collision between two of\nconstituent particles of the shells at the center of mass frame can exceed the\nPlanck energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 11:47:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 04:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-17"}

Beginning with a\nconvenience sample, each person sampled is given a small number of uniquely\nidentified coupons to distribute to other members of the target population,\nmaking them eligible for enrollment in the study. This can be an effective\nmeans to collect large diverse samples from many populations.\n  Inference from such data requires specialized techniques for two reasons.\nUnlike in standard sampling designs, the sampling process is both partially\nbeyond the control of the researcher, and partially implicitly defined.\nTherefore, it is not generally possible to directly compute the sampling\nweights necessary for traditional design-based inference. Any likelihood-based\ninference requires the modeling of the complex sampling process often beginning\nwith a convenience sample. We introduce a model-assisted approach, resulting in\na design-based estimator leveraging a working model for the structure of the\npopulation over which sampling is conducted.\n  We demonstrate that the new estimator has improved performance compared to\nexisting estimators and is able to adjust for the bias induced by the selection\nof the initial sample. We present sensitivity analyses for unknown population\nsizes and the misspecification of the working network model. We develop a\nbootstrap procedure to compute measures of uncertainty.

In\nthis paper we identify the causes for this lack of performance, and find that\nthey fall into two categories. In the first, the time step is considered a\nfunction of time alone, \\Delta=\\Delta(t). In this case, backwards error\nanalysis shows that while the algorithms remain symplectic, parametric\ninstabilities arise because of resonance between oscillations of \\Delta(t) and\nthe orbital motion. In the second category the time step is a function of phase\nspace variables \\Delta=\\Delta(q,p). In this case, the system of equations to be\nsolved is analyzed by introducing a new time variable \\tau with dt=\\Delta(q,p)\nd\\tau. The transformed equations are no longer in Hamiltonian form, and thus\nare not guaranteed to be stable even when integrated using a method which is\nsymplectic for constant \\Delta. We analyze two methods for integrating the\ntransformed equations which do, however, preserve the structure of the original\nequations. The first is an extended phase space method, which has been\nsuccessfully used in previous studies of adaptive time step symplectic\nintegrators. The second, novel, method is based on a non-canonical\nmixed-variable generating function. Numerical trials for both of these methods\nshow good results, without parametric instabilities or spurious growth or\ndamping. It is then shown how to adapt the time step to an error estimate found\nby backward error analysis, in order to optimize the time-stepping scheme.\nNumerical results are obtained using this formulation and compared with other\ntime-stepping schemes for the extended phase space symplectic method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 14:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Light curves phased with the\norbital ephemeris show evidence of relativistic beaming and weaker ellipsoidal\nvariations. The light curves also reveal secondary eclipses (depth ~ 8 mmag)\nwhile the primary eclipses appear partially compensated by the secondary\ngravitational deflection and are below detection limits. Photospheric abundance\nmeasurements show a nearly solar composition of Si, Ca, and Fe (0.1-1 solar),\nwhile the normal kinematics suggest a relatively recent formation history.\nClose binary evolutionary scenarios suggest that extremely low mass white\ndwarfs form via a common-envelope phase and possible Roche-lobe overflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 15:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-02"}

The presence of a copper layer\ncoated on the active material plays a beneficial role in increasing the cycling\nefficiency and the rate capability of silicon thin-film electrodes. Between 3C\nand C/8 discharge rates, the available cell energy decreased by 8% and 18% for\n40 nm copper-coated silicon and equivalent silicon thin-film electrodes,\nrespectively. Copper-coated silicon thin-film electrodes also show higher\ncycling efficiency, resulting in lower capacity fade, than equivalent silicon\nthin-film electrodes.

Among other things, it was proposed as a potentially viable\nexplanation of a part of the Pioneer anomaly. We study the impact that an\nanomalous Rindler-type term as large as |A_Rin| \\sim 10^-10 m s^-2 may have on\nthe the orbital dynamics of a typical object of the Oort cloud whose\nself-energy is quite smaller than its putative Rindler energy. By taking a\ntypical comet moving along a highly eccentric and inclined orbit throughout the\nexpected entire extension of the Oort cloud (0.02 pc-1 pc), it turns out that\nthe addition of an outward Rindler-like acceleration, i.e. for A_Rin > 0, does\nnot allow bound orbits. Instead, if A_Rin < 0, the resulting numerically\nintegrated trajectory is limited in space, but it radically differs from the\nstandard Keplerian ellipse. In particular, the heliocentric distance of the\ncomet gets markedly reduced and experiences high frequency oscillations, its\nspeed is increased, and the overall pattern of the trajectory is quite\nisotropic. As a consequence, the standard picture of the Oort cloud is\nradically altered since its modified orbits are much less sensitive to the\ndisturbing actions of the Galactic tide and nearby passing stars whose effects,\nin the standard scenario, are responsible for the phenomenology on which our\nconfidence in the existence of the cloud itself is based.
