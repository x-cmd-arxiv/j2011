The system consists of a (5+1)-dimensional model with a flux-stabilized\nsupersymmetric bulk coupled to non-supersymmetric matter localized on a\n(3+1)-dimensional positive-tension brane. We use recent techniques for\ncalculating how extra dimensions respond to changes in brane properties to show\n(at the classical level) that the low-energy 4D geometry is exactly flat,\nindependent of the value of the brane tensions. Its mechanism for doing so is\nthe transfer of stabilizing flux between the bulk and the branes. The UV\ncompletion of the model can arise at scales much larger than M, allowing the\ncalculation of quantum effects like the zero-point energy of very massive\nparticles in the vacuum. We find that brane-localized loops do not affect the\n4D curvature at all, but bulk loops can. These can be estimated on general\ngrounds and we show that supersymmetry dictates that they generate curvatures\nthat are generically of order m_KK^4/M_p^2. For realistic applications this\npoints to a world with two supersymmetric extra dimensions, with supersymmetry\nin the bulk broken at the sub-eV KK scale - as proposed in hep-th/0304256 -\nrequiring a 6D gravity scale somewhat higher than 10 TeV. Ordinary Standard\nModel particles are brane-localized and not at all supersymmetric (implying in\nparticular no superpartners or the MSSM). We discuss how the model evades\nvarious no-go theorems that would naively exclude it, and briefly outline\nseveral striking observational implications for tests of gravity and at the\nLHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 16:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

First, we show that a heavy-tailed\ntraffic flow is delay unstable under any scheduling policy. Then, we focus on\nthe celebrated Max-Weight scheduling policy, and show that a light-tailed flow\nthat conflicts with a heavy-tailed flow is also delay unstable. This is true\nirrespective of the rate or the tail distribution of the light-tailed flow, or\nother scheduling constraints in the network.

Finding optimal joint actions is especially challenging\nwhen each agent has only imperfect information about the state of its\nenvironment. Such problems can be modeled as collaborative Bayesian games in\nwhich each agent receives private information in the form of its type. However,\nrepresenting and solving such games requires space and computation time\nexponential in the number of agents. This article introduces collaborative\ngraphical Bayesian games (CGBGs), which facilitate more efficient collaborative\ndecision making by decomposing the global payoff function as the sum of local\npayoff functions that depend on only a few agents. We propose a framework for\nthe efficient solution of CGBGs based on the insight that they posses two\ndifferent types of independence, which we call agent independence and type\nindependence. In particular, we present a factor graph representation that\ncaptures both forms of independence and thus enables efficient solutions.

After the detection of a 321-days periodicity in X-rays, HESS\nJ0632+057 can be robustly considered a new member of the selected group of\ngamma-ray binaries. These sources are known to show extended radio structure at\nscales of milliarcseconds (mas). Aims. We present the expected extended radio\nemission on mas scales from HESS J0632+057. Methods. We observed HESS J0632+057\nwith the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.6 GHz in two epochs: during the\nJanuary/February 2011 X-ray outburst and 30 days later. Results. The VLBI image\nobtained during the outburst shows a compact ~0.4 mJy radio source, whereas 30\ndays later the source has faded and appears extended, with a projected size of\n~75 AU. The peak of the emission is displaced between runs 21+/-5 AU, which is\nbigger than the orbit size. The position of the radio source is compatible with\nthe Be star MWC 148, which sets the proper motion of the binary system below 3\nmas yr^-1 in each coordinate. The brightness temperature of the source is above\n2 \\times 10^6 K. We compare the multiwavelength properties of HESS J0632+057\nwith those of the previously known gamma-ray binaries. Conclusions. HESS\nJ0632+057 displays extended and variable non-thermal radio emission. Its\nmorphology, size, and displacement at AU scales are similar to those found in\nthe other gamma-ray binaries, PSR B1259-63, LS 5039 and LS I +61 303,\nsupporting a similar nature for HESS J0632+057.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 21:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2011 18:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-06"}

Many prior work have carried out empirical studies and proposed\ndiffusion models to understand the information diffusion process in online\nsocial networks. However, most of these studies focus on the information\ndiffusion in temporal dimension, that is, how the information propagates over\ntime. Little attempt has been given on understanding information diffusion over\nboth temporal and spatial dimensions. In this paper, we propose a Partial\nDifferential Equation (PDE), specifically, a Diffusive Logistic (DL) equation\nto model the temporal and spatial characteristics of information diffusion in\nonline social networks. To be more specific, we develop a PDE-based theoretical\nframework to measure and predict the density of influenced users at a given\ndistance from the original information source after a time period. The density\nof influenced users over time and distance provides valuable insight on the\nactual information diffusion process. We present the temporal and spatial\npatterns in a real dataset collected from Digg social news site, and validate\nthe proposed DL equation in terms of predicting the information diffusion\nprocess. Our experiment results show that the DL model is indeed able to\ncharacterize and predict the process of information propagation in online\nsocial networks. For example, for the most popular news with 24,099 votes in\nDigg, the average prediction accuracy of DL model over all distances during the\nfirst 6 hours is 92.08%. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first\nattempt to use PDE-based model to study the information diffusion process in\nboth temporal and spatial dimensions in online social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 22:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-20"}

Predictive process approximation provides an effective solution to\nthe cubic order computational complexity of Gaussian process models. This\napproximation crucially depends on a set of points, called knots, at which the\noriginal process is retained, while the rest is approximated via a\ndeterministic extrapolation. Knots should be few in number to keep the\ncomputational complexity low, but provide a good coverage of the process domain\nto limit approximation error. We present theoretical calculations to show that\ncoverage must be judged by the canonical metric of the Gaussian process. This\nnecessitates having in place a knots selection algorithm that automatically\nadapts to the changes in the canonical metric affected by changes in the\nparameter values controlling the Gaussian process covariance function. We\npresent an algorithm toward this by employing an incomplete Cholesky\nfactorization with pivoting and dynamic stopping. Although these concepts\nalready exist in the literature, our contribution lies in unifying them into a\nfast algorithm and in using computable error bounds to finesse implementation\nof the predictive process approximation.

We then study finer questions related to\ntheir distribution among the primes, and see that the $c$-Ramanujan primes\ndisplay striking behavior, deviating significantly from a probabilistic model\nbased on biased coin flipping; this was first observed by Sondow, Nicholson,\nand Noe in the case $c = 1/2$. This model is related to the Cramer model, which\ncorrectly predicts many properties of primes on large scales, but has been\nshown to fail in some instances on smaller scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 02:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 19:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 17:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 07:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

It can be used to increase\nefficiency and thus power, and to reduce possible bias. While most statistical\ntests in randomized clinical trials are nonparametric in nature, approaches for\ncovariate adjustment typically rely on specific regression models, such as the\nlinear model for a continuous outcome, the logistic regression model for a\ndichotomous outcome and the Cox model for survival time. Several recent efforts\nhave focused on model-free covariate adjustment. This paper makes use of the\nempirical likelihood method and proposes a nonparametric approach to covariate\nadjustment. A major advantage of the new approach is that it automatically\nutilizes covariate information in an optimal way without fitting nonparametric\nregression. The usual asymptotic properties, including the Wilks-type result of\nconvergence to a chi-square distribution for the empirical likelihood ratio\nbased test, and asymptotic normality for the corresponding maximum empirical\nlikelihood estimator, are established. It is also shown that the resulting test\nis asymptotically most powerful and that the estimator for the treatment effect\nachieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. The new method is applied to the\nGlobal Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO)-I trial.\nExtensive simulations are conducted, validating the theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 05:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-03"}

Moreover, we\nprove that if Q_1 and Q_2 are quadruplets of antennas of angle \\pi/2 and\nunbounded range, separated by a line, to which one applies the above\nconstruction, independently, then the induced SCG of Q_1 \\cup Q_2 is connected.\nThis latter result enables us to apply the construction locally, and to solve\nthe following two further problems.\n  In the first problem, we are given a connected unit disk graph (UDG),\ncorresponding to a set P of omni-directional antennas of range 1, and the goal\nis to replace these antennas by directional antennas of angle \\pi/2 and range\nr=O(1) and to orient them, such that the induced SCG is connected, and,\nmoreover, is an O(1)-spanner of the UDG, w.r.t. hop distance. In our solution r\n= 14\\sqrt{2} and the spanning ratio is 8. In the second problem, we are given a\nset P of directional antennas of angle \\pi/2 and adjustable range. The goal is\nto assign to each antenna p, an orientation and a range r_p, such that the\nresulting SCG is connected, and \\sum_{p \\in P} r_p^\\beta is minimized, where\n\\beta \\ge 1 is a constant. We present an O(1)-approximation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 06:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-03"}

Membrane computing\naims at defining parallel and non-deterministic computing models, called\nmembrane systems or P Systems, which abstract from the functioning and\nstructure of the cell. A membrane system consists of a spatial structure, a\nhierarchy of membranes which do not intersect, with a distinguishable membrane\ncalled skin surrounding all of them. A membrane without any other membranes\ninside is elementary, while a non-elementary membrane is a composite membrane.\nThe membranes define demarcations between regions; for each membrane there is a\nunique associated region. Since we have a one-to-one correspondence, we\nsometimes use membrane instead of region, and vice-versa. The space outside the\nskin membrane is called the environment.\n  In this thesis we define and investigate variants of systems of mobile\nmembranes as models for molecular computing and as modelling paradigms for\nbiological systems. On one hand, we follow the standard approach of research in\nmembrane computing: defining a notion of computation for systems of mobile\nmembranes, and investigating the computational power of such computing devices.\nSpecifically, we address issues concerning the power of operations for\nmodifying the membrane structure of a system of mobile membranes by mobility:\nendocytosis (moving a membrane inside a neighbouring membrane) and endocytosis\n(moving a membrane outside the membrane where it is placed). On the other hand,\nwe relate systems of mobile membranes to process algebra (mobile ambients,\ntimed mobile ambients, pi-calculus, brane calculus) by providing some encodings\nand adding some concepts inspired from process algebra in the framework of\nmobile membrane computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 07:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-11"}

Electron decay and positron\ncapture on $^{55}$Fe, on the other hand, also has a consequential role in\nincreasing the lepton ratio during the silicon burning phases of massive stars.\nThe neutrinos and antineutrinos produced, as a result of these weak-interaction\nreactions, are transparent to the stellar matter and assist in cooling the core\nthereby reducing the entropy. The structure of the presupernova star is altered\nboth by the changes in $Y_{e}$ and the entropy of the core material. The aim of\nthis paper is to report the improved microscopic calculation of Gamow-Teller\n(GT$_{\\pm}$) strength distributions of these key isotopes of iron using the\npn-QRPA theory. The main improvement comes from the incorporation of\nexperimental deformation values for these nuclei. Additionally six different\nweak-interaction rates, namely electron & positron capture, electron & positron\ndecay, and, neutrino & antineutrino cooling rates, were also calculated in\npresupernova matter. The calculated electron capture and neutrino cooling rates\ndue to isotopes of iron are in good agreement with the large-scale shell model\n(LSSM) results. The calculated beta decay rates, however, are suppressed by\nthree to five orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 08:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

The GTP cap model has been proposed to\ninterpret the stabilizing mechanism of microtubule growth from the view of\nhydrolysis effects. Besides, the microtubule growth involves the closure of a\ncurved sheet at its growing end. The curvature conversion also helps to\nstabilize the successive growth, and the curved sheet is referred to as the\nconformational cap. However, there still lacks theoretical investigation on the\nmechanical-chemical coupling growth process of microtubules. In this paper, we\nstudy the growth mechanisms of microtubules by using a coarse-grained molecular\nmethod. Firstly, the closure process involving a sheet-to-tube transition is\nsimulated. The results verify the stabilizing effect of the sheet structure,\nand the minimum conformational cap length that can stabilize the growth is\ndemonstrated to be two dimers. Then, we show that the conformational cap can\nfunction independently of the GTP cap, signifying the pivotal role of\nmechanical factors. Furthermore, based on our theoretical results, we describe\na Tetris-like growth style of microtubules: the stochastic tubulin assembly is\nregulated by energy and harmonized with the seam zipping such that the sheet\nkeeps a practically constant length during growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 10:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

These\ncorrelations are induced by realistic smoothing filters (as opposed to a filter\nthat is sharp in k-space), but have been ignored by many analyses to date. We\npresent analytical arguments -- building on existing results for Gaussian\ninitial conditions -- which suggest that the effect of the filter at large\nsmoothing scales is remarkably simple, and is in fact identical to what happens\nin the Gaussian case: the non-Gaussian walks behave as if they were smooth and\ndeterministic, or \"completely correlated\". As a result, the first crossing\ndistribution (which determines, e.g., halo abundances) follows from the\nsingle-scale statistics of the non-Gaussian density field -- the so-called\n\"cloud-in-cloud\" problem does not exist for completely correlated walks. Also,\nthe answer from single-scale statistics is simply one half that for sharp-k\nwalks. We explicitly test these arguments using Monte Carlo simulations of\nnon-Gaussian walks, showing that the resulting first crossing distributions,\nand in particular the factor 1/2 argument, are remarkably insensitive to\nvariations in the power spectrum and the defining non-Gaussian process.

A CCD survey of\nthe cluster on the UBVI and uvbyCaHbeta systems shows that the cluster is\nsuperposed upon a heavily reddened field of background stars with E(B-V) > 0.35\nmag, while the cluster has small and uniform reddening at E(b-y) = 0.075 +/-\n0.008 mag or E(B-V) = 0.103 +/- 0.011 mag, based upon 48 and 61 probable A and\nF dwarf single-star members, respectively. The errors quoted include both\ninternal photometric precision and external photometric uncertainties. The\nmetallicity derived from 61 probable single F-star members is [Fe/H] = -0.058\n+/- 0.027 (sem) from m_1 and 0.010 +/- 0.020 (sem) from hk, for a weighted\naverage of [Fe/H] = -0.019 +/- 0.023, where the errors refer to the internal\nerrors from the photometry alone. With reddening and metallicity fixed, the\ncluster age and apparent distance modulus are obtained through a comparison to\nappropriate isochrones in both VI and BV, producing 0.9 +/- 0.1 Gyr and 9.85\n+/- 0.15, respectively. The giant branch remains dominated by two distinct\nclumps of stars, though the brighter clump seems a better match to the\ncore-He-burning phase while the fainter clump straddles the first-ascent red\ngiant branch. Four potential new clump members have been identified, equally\nsplit between the two groups. Reanalysis of the UBV two-color data extending\nwell down the main sequence shows it to be optimally matched by reddening near\nE(B-V) = 0.10 rather than the older value of 0.15, leading to [Fe/H] between\n-0.16 and 0.00 from the ultraviolet excess of the unevolved dwarfs. The impact\nof the lower reddening and younger age of the cluster on previous analyses of\nthe cluster is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 14:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The intriguing occurrence of negative current patterns\nand the enhancement of the transport current flow along the center of the\nsuperconducting sample are reproduced as a straightforward consequence of the\nmagnetically induced internal anisotropy. Moreover, we show that related to a\nmaximal projection of the current density vector onto the local magnetic field,\na maximal transport current density occurs somewhere within the sample. The\nelusive measurement of the flux cutting threshold (critical value of such\nparallel component $J_{c ||}$) is suggested on the basis of local measurements\nof the transport current density. Finally, we show that a high correlation\nexists between the evolution of the transport current density and the\nappearance of paramagnetic peak structures in terms of the applied longitudinal\nmagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 09:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This theory has been successfully applied to describe the\nmorphology and kinematics of rings and spirals in external galaxies, and now,\nfor the first time, we apply it to the Milky Way. We compute the orbits\nconfined by the invariant manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits located at\nthe ends of the bar. We discuss whether the COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar\ncompose a single bar or two independent bars and perform a number of\ncomparisons which, taken together, argue strongly in favour of the former. More\nspecifically, we favour the possibility that the so-called COBE/DIRBE bar is\nthe boxy/peanut bulge of a bar whose outer thin parts are the so-called Long\nbar. This possibility is in good agreement both with observations of external\ngalaxies, with orbital structure theory and with simulations. We then analyse\nin detail the morphology and kinematics given by five representative Galactic\npotentials. Two have a Ferrers bar, two have a quadrupole bar and the last one\na composite bar. We first consider only the COBE/DIRBE bar and then extend it\nto include the effect of the Long bar. We find that the large-scale structure\ngiven by the manifolds describes an inner ring, whose size is similar to the\nnear and far 3-kpc arm, and an outer ring, whose properties resemble those of\nthe Galactic Molecular Ring. We also analyse the kinematics of these two\nstructures, under the different galactic potentials, and find they reproduce\nthe main over-densities found in the galactic longitude-velocity CO diagram.\nFinally, we consider for what model parameters, the global morphology of the\nmanifolds may reproduce the two outer spiral arms. We conclude that this would\nnecessitate either more massive and more rapidly rotating bars, or including in\nthe potential an extra component describing the spiral arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 11:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
