This integration,\nhowever, presents significant challenges. Conventionally, heteroepitaxial\ngrowth of complex multilayers on Si has been explored.

Attributing the dynamical friction force to stars moving more slowly\nthan the test body, as is commonly done, is likely to be a poor approximation\nin such a core since there are no stars moving more slowly than the local\ncircular velocity. We have tested this prediction using large-scale N-body\nexperiments. The rate of orbital decay never drops precisely to zero, because\nstars moving faster than the test body also contribute to the frictional force.\nWhen the contribution from the fast-moving stars is included in the expression\nfor the dynamical friction force, and the changes induced by the massive body\non the stellar distribution are taken into account, Chandrasekhar's theory is\nfound to reproduce the rate of orbital decay remarkably well. However, this\nrate is still substantially smaller than the rate predicted by Chandrasekhar's\nformula in its most widely-used forms, implying longer time scales for\ninspiral. Motivated by recent observations that suggest a parsec-scale core\naround the Galactic center SMBH, we investigate the evolution of a population\nof stellar-mass black holes (BHs) as they spiral in to the center of the\nGalaxy. After ~10Gyr, we find that the density of BHs can remain substantially\nless than the density in stars at all radii; we conclude that it would be\nunjustified to assume that the spatial distribution of BHs at the Galactic\ncenter is well described by steady-state models. One consequence is that rates\nof capture of BHs by the SMBH at the Galactic center (EMRIs) may be much lower\nthan in standard models.

Instead of a projection step, the\nlinearized problem defined by a current subgradient is solved, which gives a\nstep direction that will naturally stay in the domain. Our framework\ngeneralizes the sparse greedy algorithm of Frank & Wolfe and its primal-dual\nanalysis by Clarkson 2010 (and the low-rank SDP approach by Hazan 2008) to\narbitrary convex domains. We give a convergence proof guaranteeing\n{\\epsilon}-small duality gap after O(1/{\\epsilon}) iterations.\n  The method allows us to understand the sparsity of approximate solutions for\nany l1-regularized convex optimization problem (and for optimization over the\nsimplex), expressed as a function of the approximation quality.

For nuclear norm regularized\noptimization, such as matrix completion and low-rank recovery, we demonstrate\nthe practical efficiency and scalability of our algorithm for large matrix\nproblems, as e.g. the Netflix dataset.

This implies the first poly-logarithmic lower bound for the\nCap-SNDP. We next provide combinatorial algorithms for several special cases of\nthis problem. The Cap-SNDP is equivalent to its special case when every edge\nhas either zero cost or infinite capacity. We consider a special case, called\nConnected Cap-SNDP, where all infinite-capacity edges in the solution are\nrequired to form a connected component containing the sinks.

However,\nits impact on the susceptibility of the disc to fragmentation is less clear. We\nuse two-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of\nself-gravitating discs as a function of the local cooling time and strength of\nirradiation. In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local\nthermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be\nrepresented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at\nleast 240 dynamical times).

Except for\nsome simple toy models, it is, however, difficult to find all the vacua\nanalytically. Recently developed algorithmic methods based on symbolic computer\nalgebra can be of great help in the more realistic models. However, they suffer\nfrom serious algorithmic complexities and are limited to small system sizes. In\nthis article, we review a numerical method called the numerical polynomial\nhomotopy continuation (NPHC) method, first used in the areas of lattice field\ntheories, which by construction finds \\textit{all} of the vacua of a given\npotential that is known to have only isolated solutions. The NPHC method is\nknown to suffer from no major algorithmic complexities and is\n\\textit{embarrassingly parallelizable}, and hence its applicability goes way\nbeyond the existing symbolic methods. We first solve a simple toy model as a\nwarm up example to demonstrate the NPHC method at work and compare the results\nwith the available results from the symbolic methods. We then show that all the\nvacua of a more complicated model of M theory compactified on the coset\n$\\frac{SU(3)\\times U(1)}{U(1)\\times U(1)}$, which has an SU(3) structure, can\nbe obtained by the NPHC method using a desktop machine in just about one hour,\na feat which was reported to be prohibitively difficult by the existing\nsymbolic methods. Finally, we compare the various technicalities between the\ntwo methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 20:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-15"}

The goal is to use the orbital period change to measure the mass\nejected during each eruption as the key part of trying to measure whether the\nRNe white dwarfs are gaining or losing mass over an entire eruption cycle, and\nhence whether they can be progenitors for Type Ia supernovae. This program has\nnow been completed for two eclipsing RNe; CI Aquilae (CI Aql) across its\neruption in 2000 and U Scorpii (U Sco) across its eruption in 1999. For CI Aql,\nI present 78 eclipse times from 1991-2009 (including four during the tail of\nthe 2000 eruption) plus two eclipses from 1926 and 1935. For U Sco, I present\n67 eclipse times, including 46 times during quiescence from 1989-2009, plus 21\neclipse times in the tails of the 1945, 1999, and 2010 eruptions. The eclipse\ntimes during the tails of eruptions are systematically and substantially\nshifted with respect to the ephemerides from the eclipses in quiescence, with\nthis being caused by shifts of the center of light during the eruption. These\neclipse times are plotted on an O-C diagram and fitted to models with a steady\nperiod change (Pdot) between eruptions (caused by, for example, conservative\nmass transfer) plus an abrupt period change (DeltaP) at the time of eruption.\nFor CI Aql, the best fit is DeltaP=-3.7^{+9.2}_{-7.3} X 10^{-7}. For U Sco, the\nbest fit is DeltaP=(+43+-69) X 10^{-7} days.

Our approach consists of\nformulating the indexing problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. We\nbegin with a database, abstracted as a collection of strings. From this data\nset we generate a query workload. The input to the optimization problem is the\ndatabase and the workload. The output is a set of multigrams (substrings) which\ncan be used as keys to records which satisfy the query workload. The multigrams\ncan then be integrated with the data structure (like B+ trees) to provide\nindexing support for the queries. We provide a deterministic and a randomized\napproximation algorithm (with provable guarantees) to solve the optimization\nproblem. Extensive experiments on synthetic data sets demonstrate that our\napproach is accurate and efficient.\n  We also present a case study on PROSITE patterns - which are complex regular\nexpression signatures for classes of proteins. Again, we are able to\ndemonstrate the utility of our indexing approach in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency.

Narrow-band interference filters can be tuned toward shorter\nwavelengths by tilting them from the perpendicular to the optical axis. This\ncan be used as a cheap alternative to real tunable filters, such as\nFabry-P\\'erot interferometers and Lyot filters. At the Swedish 1-m Solar\nTelescope, such a setup is used to scan through the blue wing of the Ca II H\nline. Because the filter is mounted in a converging beam, the incident angle\nvaries over the pupil, which causes a variation of the transmission over the\npupil, different for each wavelength within the passband. This causes\nbroadening of the filter transmission profile and degradation of the image\nquality. Aims. We want to characterize the properties of our filter, at normal\nincidence as well as at different tilt angles. Knowing the broadened profile is\nimportant for the interpretation of the solar images.

We repeat the analysis with subsets which are\ndivided based on the criterion of which hemisphere is dominant for a given\nsolar cycle. Our primary findings are as follows: (1) COL is not monotonically\ndecreasing with time in each cycle. Small humps can be seen (or short plateaus)\naround every solar maxima. (2) The distribution of COL resulting from each\nhemisphere is bimodal, which can well be represented by the double Gaussian\nfunction. (3) As far as the primary component of the double Gaussian function\nis concerned, for a given data subset, the distributions due to the sunspots\nappearing in two different hemispheres are alike. Regardless of which\nhemisphere is magnetically dominant, the primary component of the double\nGaussian function seems relatively unchanged. (4) When the northern (southern)\nhemisphere is dominant the width of the secondary component of the double\nGaussian function in the northern (southern) hemisphere case is about twice as\nwide as that in the southern (northern) hemisphere. (5) For the distribution of\nthe COL averaged with signed latitude, whose distribution is basically\ndescribed by a single Gaussian function, it is shifted to the positive\n(negative) side when the northern (southern) hemisphere is dominant.

Acoustically tracked RAFOS floats released in the\nsouthward-flowing Western Boundary Current at the exit of the Labrador Sea\nreveal the formation of three of these eddies at the southern tip of the Grand\nBanks (42 N, 50 W). Using a recently developed method to detect eddies in float\ntrajectories and estimate their kinematic properties, it was found that the\neddies had average rotation periods of 5--7 days at radii of 1025 km, with mean\nrotation speeds of up to 0.3 m/s.

Admixture of strange-antistrange quark\npairs in the nucleon wave function enables the direct coupling to the phi-meson\nin the annihilation channel without violating the OZI rule. Three forms are\nconsidered in this work for the strangeness content of the proton wave\nfunction, namely, the uud cluster with a strange-antistrange sea quark\ncomponent, kaon-hyperon clusters based on a simple chiral quark model, and the\npentaquark picture. Nonrelativistic quark model calculations reveal that the\nstrangeness magnetic moment and the strangeness contribution to the proton spin\nfrom the first two models are consistent with recent experimental data. For the\nthird model, the uuds subsystem with the configurations FS[31]F[211]S[22] and\nFS[31]F[31]S[22] leads to negative values for the strangeness magnetic moment\nand the strangeness contribution to the proton spin.

In laboratory experiments\nwe study the growth of large aggregates of $\\sim$ 3 mm to 3 cm through\ncontinuous impacts of small dust agglomerates of 100 $\\mu$m size, consisting of\n$\\mu$m grains at different impact velocities. The experiments show that\nagglomerates grow by direct sticking as well as gravitational reaccretion.

For about four and a half decades, astrophysicists have recognised the\nimportance of the thermal instablity for the formation of clouds in the\ninterstellar medium. Even in the past several years, many papers have concerned\nthe role of the thermal instability in the production of molecular clouds.\nAbout three and a half decades ago, astrophysicists investigating radiative\nshocks noticed that for many cooling laws such shocks are unstable. Attempts to\naddress the effects of cosmic rays on the stablity of radiative media that are\ninitially uniform or that have just passed through shocks have been made. The\nsimplest approach to such studies involves the assumption that the cosmic rays\nbehave as a fluid. Work based on such an approach is described. Cosmic rays\nhave no effect on the stability of initially uniform, static media with respect\nto isobaric perturbations, though they do affect the stability of such media\nwith respect to isentropic perturbations. The effect of cosmic rays on the\nstability of radiative shocked media depends greatly on the efficiency of the\nconversion of energy in accelerated cosmic rays into thermal energy in the\nthermalized fluid. If that efficiency is low, radiative cooling makes weak\nshocks propagating into upstream media with low cosmic-ray pressures more\nlikely to be cosmic-ray dominated than adiabatic shocks of comparable strength.\nThe cosmic-ray dominated shocks do not display radiative overstability. Highly\nefficient conversion of cosmic-ray energy into thermal energy leads shocked\nmedia to behave as they do when cosmic rays are absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 09:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-08"}

Thanks to their\nimproved sensitivity, they promise to yield a number of detections and thus to\nopen a new observational windows for astronomy and astrophysics. Among the\nscientific goals that should be achieved, there is the independent measurement\nof the value of the cosmological parameters, hence an independent test of the\ncurrent cosmological paradigm. Due to the importance of such task, a number of\nstudies have evaluated the capabilities of GW telescopes in this respect.\nHowever, since GW do not yield information about the source redshift, different\ngroups have made different assumptions regarding the means through which the GW\nredshift can be obtained. These different assumptions imply also different\nmethodologies to solve this inference problem. This work presents a formalism\nbased on Bayesian inference developed to facilitate the inclusion of all\nassumptions and prior information about a GW source within a single data\nanalysis framework. This approach guarantees the minimisation of information\nloss and the possibility of including naturally event-specific knowledge (such\nas the sky position for a Gamma Ray Burst - GW coincident observation) in the\nanalysis. The workings of the method are applied to a specific example, loosely\ndesigned along the lines of the method proposed by Schutz in 1986, in which one\nuses information from wide-field galaxy surveys as prior information for the\nlocation of a GW source.

Both mass loss and turbulence have been invoked to slow\ndown atomic diffusion in order to match observed abundances. The fact that some\nsdB stars show pulsations gives upper limits on the amount of mass loss and\nturbulent mixing allowed. Consequently, non-adiabatic asteroseismology has the\npotential to decide which process is responsible for the abundance anomalies.\nWe compute for the first time seismic properties of sdB models with atomic\ndiffusion included consistently during the stellar evolution. The diffusion\nequations with radiative forces are solved for H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Fe and\nNi. We examine the effects of various mass-loss rates and mixed surface masses\non the abundances and mode stability. It is shown that the mass-loss rates\nneeded to simulate the observed He abundances (10^{-14}<=Mdot\n[Msun/yr]<=10^{-13}) are not consistent with observed pulsations. We find that\nfor pulsations to be driven the rates should be Mdot<=10^{-15} Msun/yr. On the\nother hand, weak turbulent mixing of the outer 10^{-6} Msun can explain the He\nabundance anomalies while still allowing pulsations to be driven. The origin of\nthe turbulence remains unknown but the presence of pulsations gives tight\nconstraints on the underlying turbulence model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 12:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

At the first stage, a load balancing breadth-first-search-based\nvertex coloring algorithm for multi-radio conflict graph is proposed to\nintelligently allocate multiple control channels.

In Green, a content provider (i.e., creator or sharer) publishes\nthe information of his shared contents to a group of content maintainers\nself-organized in a security overlay for providing the mechanisms of redundancy\nand reliability, so that a content requestor can obtain and filter the\ninformation of his requested content from the associated maintainers.

We\ndesign a novel adaptive and interaction-based computational puzzle scheme at\nthe Phagocytes to restrain external worms attacking the P2P overlay, without\ninfluencing legitimate hosts' experiences significantly. We implement a\nprototype system, and evaluate its performance based on realistic massive-scale\nP2P network traces. The evaluation results illustrate that our Phagocytes are\ncapable of achieving a total defense against active P2P worms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 15:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-08"}

Since k-means depends mainly on distance\ncalculation between all data points and the centers, the time cost will be high\nwhen the size of the dataset is large (for example more than 500millions of\npoints). We propose a two stage algorithm to reduce the time cost of distance\ncalculation for huge datasets. The first stage is a fast distance calculation\nusing only a small portion of the data to produce the best possible location of\nthe centers. The second stage is a slow distance calculation in which the\ninitial centers used are taken from the first stage. The fast and slow stages\nrepresent the speed of the movement of the centers. In the slow stage, the\nwhole dataset can be used to get the exact location of the centers. The time\ncost of the distance calculation for the fast stage is very low due to the\nsmall size of the training data chosen. The time cost of the distance\ncalculation for the slow stage is also minimized due to small number of\niterations. Different initial locations of the clusters have been used during\nthe test of the proposed algorithms. For large datasets, experiments show that\nthe 2-stage clustering method achieves better speed-up (1-9 times).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 15:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-08"}

Understanding the program is related to execution behaviour and\nrelationship of variable involved in the program. The task of finding all\nstatements in a program that directly or indirectly influence the value for an\noccurrence of a variable gives the set of statements that can affect the value\nof a variable at some point in a program is called a program slice. Program\nslicing is a technique for extracting parts of computer programs by tracing the\nprograms' control and data flow related to some data item. This technique is\napplicable in various areas such as debugging, program comprehension and\nunderstanding, program integration, cohesion measurement, re-engineering,\nmaintenance, testing where it is useful to be able to focus on relevant parts\nof large programs. This paper focuses on the various slicing techniques (not\nlimited to) like static slicing, quasi static slicing, dynamic slicing and\nconditional slicing. This paper also includes various methods in performing the\nslicing like forward slicing, backward slicing, syntactic slicing and semantic\nslicing. The slicing of a program is carried out using Java which is a object\noriented programming language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2011 15:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-08"}

To detect real time human face AdaBoost with Haar cascade is used and\na simple fast PCA and LDA is used to recognize the faces detected.
