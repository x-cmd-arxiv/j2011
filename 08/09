Three simple requirements make anharmonic\nwaves compatible with relativistic field theory and quantum physics.

The most general class of anharmonic waves allows for a zero\nfrequency term in the Fourier series, which corresponds to a quantum field with\na non-zero vacuum expectation value. Anharmonic quantum fields are defined by\ngeneralizing the expansion of a field operator into creation and annihilation\noperators.

In this article we show that in\nthe presence of a Chern-Simons coupling, a magnetically charged extended event\nemits an extended object, which geometrically is just like a Dirac string, but\nit is observable, obeys equations of motion, and may be electrically charged.\nWe write a complete action principle which accounts for this effect. The action\ninvolves two Chern-Simons terms, one integrated over spacetime and the other\nintegrated over the worldvolume of the submanifold that is the union of the\nDirac world-sheet and the history of the emitted physical object. By demanding\nthat the total charge emitted by a composite extended magnetic event be\nquantized according to Dirac's rule, we find a quantization condition for the\nChern-Simons coupling. For a 1-form electric potential in D=2n+1 spacetime\ndimensions, the composite event is formed by n elementary extended magnetic\nevents separated in time such that the product of their transverse spaces,\ntogether with the time axis, is the entire spacetime. We show that the emitted\nelectric charge is given by the integral of the (n-1)-th exterior power of the\nelectromagnetic field strength over the last elementary event, or,\nequivalently, over an appropriate closed surface. The extension to more general\np-form potentials and higher dimensions is also discussed. For the case D=11,\np=3, our result for the quantization of the Chern-Simons coupling was obtained\npreviously in the context of M-theory, a remarkable agreement that makes the\nexistence of events even more compelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 17:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The first direction is concerned with the characterization of\n\\emph{strategyproof} (SP) mechanisms; i.e., mechanisms that induce truthful\nreporting as a dominant strategy; and the second direction quantifies how well\nvarious objective functions can be approximated when restricted to SP\nmechanisms. The current paper provides contributions in both directions. First,\nwe construct a parameterized randomized SP mechanism, and show that all of the\npreviously proposed deterministic and randomized SP mechanisms for the current\nsettings can be formalized as special cases of this mechanism. Second, we give\ntight results for the approximation ratio of SP mechanisms with respect to the\nobjective of minimizing the sum of squares of distances to the agents\n(\\emph{miniSOS}). Holzman \\cite{Holzman1990} provided an axiomatic foundation\nfor this function, showing that it is the unique function that satisfies\nunanimity, continuity and invariance. We devise a randomized mechanism that\ngives a 1.5-approximation for the miniSOS function, and show that no other\nrandomized SP mechanism can provide a better approximation. This mechanism\nchooses the average location with probability 1/2 and a \\emph{random dictator}\nwith probability 1/2. For deterministic mechanisms, we show that the median\nmechanism provides a 2-approximation, and this is tight.

The network structure,\ndescribing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize\nthe behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not\ncontinuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email,\ntext messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or\npractically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for\nnon-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at\nhospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals\nis on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the\ntemporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems\ninteracting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of\npatients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we\npresent the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for\nanalyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their\nrelation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional\nnetwork theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when\nthings happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself.\nSince fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not\nnecessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite\ndifferent from those for static networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 18:51:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 02:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-10"}

The intuition that the\nedge distribution is roughly uniform at all times led to a folklore conjecture\nthat the final number of edges is $n^{3/2+o(1)}$ with high probability, whereas\nthe best known upper bound is $n^{7/4+o(1)}$. It is no coincidence that various\nmethods break precisely at the exponent 7/4 as it corresponds to the inherent\nbarrier where co-degrees become comparable to the variations in their values\nthat arose earlier in the process.\n  In this work we significantly improve upon the previous bounds by\nestablishing that w.h.p. the number of edges in the final graph is at most $\nn^{5/3+o(1)} $.

In particular,\nwhile increasing values of $p$ promote biodiversity, they may act detrimental\non spatial pattern formation. For random initial conditions, we observe a phase\ntransition from biodiversity to an absorbing phase, whereby the critical value\nof mobility grows linearly with increasing values of $p$ on a log-log scale,\nbut then saturates as $p$ becomes large. For prepared initial conditions, we\nobserve the formation of single-armed spirals, but only for values of $p$ that\nare below a critical value. Once above, the spirals break up and form\ndisordered spatial structures, mainly because of the percolation of vacant\nsites. Thus, there exists a critical value of the competition rate $p_{c}$ for\nstable single-armed spirals in finite populations. Importantly though, $p_{c}$\nincreases with increasing system size, because noise reinforces the\ndisintegration of ordered patterns. In addition, we also find that $p_{c}$\nincreases with the mobility. These phenomena are reproduced by a deterministic\nmodel that is based on nonlinear partial differential equations. Our findings\nindicate that competition is vital for the sustenance of biodiversity and\nemergence of pattern formation in ecosystems governed by cyclical interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 19:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-09"}

The\nemployed grid is defined as the Voronoi tessellation of a set of\nmesh-generating points which can move along with the flow, yielding an\nautomatic adaptivity of the mesh and a substantial reduction of advection\nerrors. Our scheme solves the MHD Riemann problem in the rest frame of the\nVoronoi interfaces using the HLLD Riemann solver. To satisfy the divergence\nconstraint of the magnetic field in multiple dimensions, the Dedner divergence\ncleaning method is applied. In a set of standard test problems we show that the\nnew code produces accurate results, and that the divergence of the magnetic\nfield is kept sufficiently small to closely preserve the correct physical\nsolution. We also apply the code to two first application problems, namely\nsupersonic MHD turbulence and the spherical collapse of a magnetized cloud. We\nverify that the code is able to handle both problems well, demonstrating the\napplicability of this MHD version of AREPO to a wide range of problems in\nastrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In a previous\nstudy, in which we included only cold gas in the disk, we showed that the\npresence of cold gas decreased the thickening by a minor merger relative to the\nno-gas case.

In this scenario, the thick disc is the old stellar disc that has\nbeen thickened in a minor merger at z>1, while the thin disc is the new stellar\ndisc that reforms after this merger. In addition, we study the evolution of the\nscale height during a 1:5 merger and find that a thin disc can be present even\nafter this merger, provided enough hot gas is available.

The peak of this\nemission crosses the mm/submm range during the first hours to days, making\ntheir study in this range crucial for constraining the models. Observations\nhave been limited until now due to the low sensitivity of the observatories in\nthis range. We present observations of 10 GRB afterglows obtained from APEX and\nSMA, as well as the first detection of a GRB with ALMA, and put them into\ncontext with all the observations that have been published until now in the\nspectral range that will be covered by ALMA. The catalogue of mm/submm\nobservations collected here is the largest to date and is composed of 102 GRBs,\nof which 88 had afterglow observations, whereas the rest are host galaxy\nsearches. With our programmes, we contributed with data of 11 GRBs and the\ndiscovery of 2 submm counterparts. In total, the full sample, including data\nfrom the literature, has 22 afterglow detections with redshift ranging from\n0.168 to 8.2. GRBs have been detected in mm/submm wavelengths with peak\nluminosities spanning 2.5 orders of magnitude, the most luminous reaching\n10^33erg s^-1 Hz^-1. We observe a correlation between the X-ray brightness at\n0.5 days and the mm/submm peak brightness. Finally we give a rough estimate of\nthe distribution of peak flux densities of GRB afterglows, based on the current\nmm/submm sample. Observations in the mm/submm bands have been shown to be\ncrucial for our understanding of the physics of GRBs, but have until now been\nlimited by the sensitivity of the observatories. With the start of the\noperations at ALMA, the sensitivity will be increased by more than an order of\nmagnitude.

The present\npseudo-spins arise from a spin-orbital locking and are different from the jeff\n= 1/2 moments that are obtained when the spin-orbit coupling dominates and\ntrigonal distortions are neglected. The resulting spin Hamiltonian is\nanisotropic and frustrated by further neighbour interactions. Mean field theory\nsuggests a ground state with 4-sublattice zig-zag magnetic order in a parameter\nregime that can be relevant to the honeycomb iridate compound Na2IrO3, where\nsimilar magnetic ground state has recently been observed. Various properties of\nthe phase, the spin-wave spectrum and experimental consequences are discussed.\nThe present approach contrasts with the recent proposals to understand iridate\ncompounds starting from the strong spin-orbit coupling limit and neglecting\nnon-cubic lattice distortions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 20:07:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 03:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 17:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-10"}

They develop \"tails,\" traveling at all\nspeeds equal to and less than unity. If sizeable, this off-the-null-cone effect\ncould mean objects at cosmological distances, such as supernovae, appear dimmer\nthan they really are. Their light curves may be distorted relative to their\nflat spacetime counterparts. These in turn could affect how we infer the\nproperties and evolution of the universe or the objects it contains. Within the\ngravitational context, the tail effect induces a self-force that causes a\ncompact object orbiting a massive black hole to deviate from an otherwise\ngeodesic path. This needs to be taken into account when modeling the\ngravitational waves expected from such sources. Motivated by these\nconsiderations, we develop perturbation theory for solving the massless scalar,\nphoton and graviton retarded Green's functions in perturbed spacetimes,\nassuming these Green's functions are known in the background spacetime. In\nparticular, we elaborate on the theory in perturbed Minkowski spacetime in\nsignificant detail; and apply our techniques to compute the retarded Green's\nfunctions in the weak field limit of the Kerr spacetime to first order in the\nblack hole's mass and angular momentum. Our methods build on and generalizes\nwork appearing in the literature on this topic to date, and lays the foundation\nfor a thorough, first principles based, investigation of how light propagates\nover cosmological distances, within a spatially flat inhomogeneous\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. This perturbative\nscheme applied to the graviton Green's function, when pushed to higher orders,\nmay provide approximate analytic (or semi-analytic) results for the self-force\nproblem in the weak field limits of the Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole\ngeometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 23:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 22:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 17:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We consider a D-dimensional lattice\nas information graph, of which the 1-D platoon is a special case. The stability\nmargin is measured by the real part of the least stable eigenvalue of the\nclosed-loop state matrix, which quantifies the rate of decay of initial errors.\nIn [1], it was shown that with symmetric control, in which two neighbors put\nequal weight on information received from each other, the stability margin of a\n1-D vehicular platoon decays to 0 as O(1/N^2), where N is the number of\nvehicles. Moreover, a perturbation analysis was used to show that with\nvanishingly small amount of asymmetry in the control gains, the stability\nmargin scaling can be improved to O(1/N). In this paper, we show that, with\njudicious choice of non-vanishing asymmetry in control, the stability margin of\nthe closed loop can be bounded away from zero uniformly in N. Asymmetry in\ncontrol gains thus makes the control architecture highly scalable.

Each channel is a binary relation that imposes\nsynchronization and data constraints on input and output messages. Furthermore,\nchannels are composed together to realize arbitrarily complex behavioral\nprotocols. During this process, a designer may introduce errors into the\nconnector model or the code for their execution, and thus affect the behavior\nof a composed service. In this paper, we present an approach for model-based\ntesting of coordination protocols designed in Reo. Our approach is based on the\ninput-output conformance (ioco) testing theory and exploits the mapping of\nautomata-based semantic models for Reo to equivalent process algebra\nspecifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 06:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-10"}

In 2009, it is estimated that more than 150,000\ndeaths will result from lung cancer alone. Genetic information is an extremely\nvaluable data source in characterizing the personal nature of cancer. Over the\npast several years, investigators have conducted numerous association studies\nwhere intensive genetic data is collected on relatively few patients compared\nto the numbers of gene predictors, with one scientific goal being to identify\ngenetic features associated with cancer recurrence or survival. In this note,\nwe propose high-dimensional survival analysis through a new application of\nboosting, a powerful tool in machine learning. Our approach is based on an\naccelerated lifetime model and minimizing the sum of pairwise differences in\nresiduals. We apply our method to a recent microarray study of lung\nadenocarcinoma and find that our ensemble is composed of 19 genes, while a\nproportional hazards (PH) ensemble is composed of nine genes, a proper subset\nof the 19-gene panel. In one of our simulation scenarios, we demonstrate that\nPH boosting in a misspecified model tends to underfit and ignore\nmoderately-sized covariate effects, on average. Diagnostic analyses suggest\nthat the PH assumption is not satisfied in the microarray data and may explain,\nin part, the discrepancy in the sets of active coefficients. Our simulation\nstudies and comparative data analyses demonstrate how statistical learning by\nPH models alone is insufficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 08:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-10"}

The average values <A_{ij}>=0 and\ndispersion <A_{ij}^2>=V^2 for all non-zero elements. The density of vibrational\nstates g(w) of the matrix M for N,n >> 1 is given by the Wigner quarter circle\nlaw with radius independent of N.

With the motivation of developing a\npacket forwarding mechanism that is tolerant to node density, an alternative\nposition-based protocol is proposed in this paper. In contrast to existing\nbeaconless protocols, the proposed protocol is designed such that it eliminates\nthe need for potential relays to undergo a relay selection process. Rather, any\neligible relay may decide to forward the packet ahead, thus significantly\nreducing the underlying overhead. The operation of the proposed protocol is\nempowered by exploiting favorable features of orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) at the physical layer. The end-to-end performance of the\nproposed protocol is evaluated against existing beaconless position-based\nprotocols analytically and as well by means of simulations.

By developing models to simulate\nfull-body reaching movements in 3D space we can begin to explore cost functions\nthat may be used by the central nervous system to plan and execute these\nmovements. Methods A robust simulation model was developed using 1)\ngraphic-based modeling tools to generate an inverse dynamics controller\n(SimMechanics), 2) controller parameterization methods, and 3) cost function\ncriteria. An adaptive weight coefficient based on the final motor task error\n(i.e. distance between end-effector and target at the end of movement) was\nproposed to balance motor task error and physiological cost terms (e.g. joint\npower). The output of the simulation models using different cost controller\nfunctions based on motor task error or motor task error and various\nphysiological cost terms (e.g. joint power, center of mass displacement) were\ncompared to experimental data from 15 healthy participants performing full body\nreaching movements.

Second, the Hall magnetic field is characterized by a two-scale\nstructure in presence of O+ ions: it reaches sharp peak values in a small area\nin proximity of the neutral line, and then decreases slowly over a large\nregion.

Our approach\nmaps terms in a document corpus to a new term space in order to reduce the\nnumber of non-zero elements in the term-document matrix, resulting in a more\ncompact inverted index.

If its pseudodistance is nondegenerate, all of\nits null geodesics must be incomplete. Thus an Einstein manifold (M,g) has no\ncomplete null geodesic if there is a \"physical metric\" in the conformal class\nof g satisfying the null convergence and null generic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 15:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-10"}
