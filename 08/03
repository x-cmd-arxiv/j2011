At 70 {\\deg}C,\nsequential hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure and electrochemical oxidation\nexperiments indicate that as much as 6% of total Pt sites are deactivated per\nmonolayer sulfur adsorption at open circuit potential of a PEM fuel cell\nfollowed by its removal. The extent of such deactivation is much higher when\nthe electrode is exposed to H2S when the fuel cell is operating at a finite\nload, and is dependent on the local overpotential and the duration of exposure.\nRegardless of this deactivation, the H2/O2 polarization curves obtained on\npost-recovery electrodes do not show performance losses suggesting that such\nperformance curves alone cannot be used to assess the extent of recovery due to\nsulfur poisoning. A concise mechanism for the adsorption and electro-oxidation\nof H2S on Pt anode is presented. H2S dissociatively adsorbs onto Pt as two\ndifferent sulfur species and at intermediate oxidation potentials, undergoes\nelectro-oxidation to sulfur and then to sulfur dioxide (SO2). This mechanism is\nvalidated by charge balances between hydrogen desorption and sulfur\nelectro-oxidation on Pt. The ignition potential for sulfur oxidation decreases\nwith increase in temperature, which coupled with faster electro-oxidation\nkinetics result in the easier removal of adsorbed sulfur at higher\ntemperatures. Furthermore, the adsorption potential is found to influence\nsulfur coverage of an electrode exposed to H2S. As an implication, the local\npotential of a PEM fuel cell anode exposed to H2S contaminated fuel should be\nkept below the equilibrium potential for sulfur oxidation to prevent\nirreversible loss of Pt sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 16:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-03"}

As such, ordinary DFT is neither able to treat\ntime-dependent (TD) problems nor describe excited electronic states. In 1984,\nRunge and Gross proved a theorem making TD-DFT formally exact. Information\nabout electronic excited states may be obtained from this theory through the\nlinear response (LR) theory formalism. Begin- ning in the mid-1990s, LR-TD-DFT\nbecame increasingly popular for calculating absorption and other spectra of\nmedium- and large-sized molecules. Its ease of use and relatively good accuracy\nhas now brought LR-TD-DFT to the forefront for this type of application.

Since doubly-excited\nstates have a particularly important role to play in bond dissociation and\nformation in both thermal and photochemistry, particular emphasis will be\nplaced upon the problem of going beyond or around the TD-DFT adiabatic\napproximation which limits TD-DFT calculations to nominally singly-excited\nstates.

Abundance anomalies observed in a fraction of A and B stars of both\nPop I and II are apparently related to internal particle transport. Aims. Using\navailable constraints from Sirius A, we wish to determine how well evolutionary\nmodels including atomic diffusion can explain observed abundance anomalies when\neither turbulence or mass loss is used as the main competitor to atomic\ndiffusion. Methods. Complete stellar evolution models, including the effects of\natomic diffusion and radiative accelerations, have been computed from the zero\nage main-sequence of 2.1M\\odot stars for metallicities of Z0 = 0.01 \\pm 0.001\nand shown to agree with the observed parameters of Sirius A. Surface abundances\nwere predicted for three values of the mass loss rate and for four values of\nthe mixed surface zone. Results. A mixed mass of ~ 10^-6 M\\odot or a mass loss\nrate of 10^-13 M\\odot/yr were determined through comparison with observations.\nOf the 17 abundances determined observationally which are included in our\ncalculations, up to 15 can be predicted within 2 sigmas and 3 of the 4\ndetermined upper limits are compatible. Conclusions. While the abundance\nanomalies can be reproduced slightly better using turbulence as the process\ncompeting with atomic diffusion, mass loss probably ought to be preferred since\nthe mass loss rate required to fit abundance anomalies is compatible with the\nobservationally determined rate. A mass loss rate within a factor of 2 of\n10^-13 M\\odot/yr is preferred. This restricts the range of the directly\nobserved mass loss rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 19:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Upon lithiation, due to substrate\nconstraint, the silicon electrode initially undergoes elastic deformation,\nresulting in rapid rise of compressive stress. The electrode begins to deform\nplastically at a compressive stress of ca. -1.75 GPa; subsequent lithiation\nresults in continued plastic strain, dissipating mechanical energy. Upon\ndelithiation, the electrode first undergoes elastic straining in the opposite\ndirection, leading to a tensile stress of ca. 1 GPa; subsequently, it deforms\nplastically during the rest of delithiation. The plastic flow stress evolves\ncontinuously with lithium concentration. Thus, mechanical energy is dissipated\nin plastic deformation during both lithiation and delithiation, and it can be\ncalculated from the stress measurements; we show that it is comparable to the\npolarization loss. Upon current interrupt, both the film stress and the\nelectrode potential relax with similar time-constants, suggesting that stress\ncontributes significantly to the chemical potential of lithiated-silicon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 19:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-03"}

Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field The-\nory, one way of connecting gravity dual models to gauge theories, is a\ncorrespon- dence between a ten-dimensional Type IIB superstring theory in AdS5\n\\times S 5 and a N = 4 super Yang Mills theory. To describe systems that are\nexperimentally ac- cessible, however, the formal correspondence is modified\ninto a phenomenological duality between a five-dimensional gravity model and a\nstrongly coupled QCD-like gauge theory. This duality is referred to as AdS/QCD.\nThis work explores aspects of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model. The phrase 'soft\nwall' refers to the means of breaking the conformal symmetry and introducing a\nmass scale to the gauge side of the duality. We add higher-order terms to the\nsoft-wall Lagrangian and calculate the effect on physical observables. Meson\nmass spectra gain a more complex structure, exhibiting a better match with the\nexperimental values than previous models. The Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner rela- tion\nnaturally emerges from the model. We calculate the form factor F{\\pi} and the\ncoupling g{\\rho}{\\pi}{\\pi} as a non-trivial test on the limits of our soft-wall\nmodel. Introducing a black brane into the gravity dual metric allows us to\nderive thermodynamic quantities in the gauge theory. As expected at high\ntemperatures, the entropy scales as the cube of the temperature, and the speed\nof sound reaches its conformal limit of one-third. Thermal condensates\ncontribute leading-order terms, modifying the temperature, entropy, and free\nenergy behavior.

We present a new analytic method of quantifying the frequency of\nencounters involving single, binary and triple stars. With this technique, we\nhave shown that dynamical encounters involving triple stars occur commonly in\nat least some SCs, and that they are likely to be an important dynamical\nchannel for stellar mergers to occur. We have also used our techniques to\nanalyze observational data for a large sample of SCs taken from the ACS Survey\nfor Globular Clusters. The results of this analysis are as follows: (1) We have\ncompiled a homogeneous catalogue of stellar populations for every cluster in\nour sample, including main-sequence (MS), red giant branch, horizontal branch\nand blue straggler (BS) stars. (2) With this catalogue, we have quantified the\neffects of the cluster dynamics in determining the relative sizes and spatial\ndistributions of these stellar populations. (3) These results are particularly\ninteresting for BSs since they provide compelling evidence that they are\ndescended from binary stars. (4) Our analysis of the MS populations is\nconsistent with a remarkably universal initial stellar mass function in old\nmassive SCs in the Milky Way. This is a new result with important implications\nfor our understanding of star formation in the early Universe and, more\ngenerally, the history of our Galaxy.

This facilitates an investigation of the\nproperties, geometry and location of the absorbing dust of these\npoorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts from\noptically-selected samples. The hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse in\ntheir properties, but on average redder, more luminous and massive than the\nhosts of optically-bright events. We hence probe a different galaxy population,\nsuggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive,\nchemically-evolved and metal-rich members. This also indicates that the dust\nalong the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probably\nlocated in the diffuse ISM or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate GRB\nenvironment.

This suggests that GRBs trace the global\nstar-formation rate better than studies based on optically-selected host\nsamples indicate, and the previously-claimed deficiency of high-mass host\ngalaxies was at least partially a selection effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 20:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

For many of these systems, the exact nature of the evolutionary\nchannels by which they form remains uncertain. The canonical explanation calls\nfor the progenitor binary system to undergo two subsequent mass-transfer\nevents, both of which are unstable and lead to a common envelope (CE) phase.\nHowever, it has been shown that if both CE events obey the standard alpha\nprescription, it is not possible to reproduce all of the observed systems. As\nan alternative prescription, the gamma-formalism was proposed, which\nparametrizes the fraction of angular momentum carried away with mass loss, in\ncontrast to the alpha prescription, which parametrizes energy loss. We\ndemonstrate that the gamma-prescription is also inadequate in describing the\nevolution of an arbitrary DWD binary; clearly we require a deeper understanding\nof the physical mechanisms underlying their formation. We then present a\ndetailed model for the evolution of Red Giant -- Main Sequence binaries during\nthe first episode of mass transfer, and demonstrate that their evolution into\nDWDs need not arise through two phases of dynamical mass loss. Instead, the\nfirst episode of dramatic mass loss may be stable, non-conservative mass\ntransfer. The second phase is then well described by the alpha prescription. We\nfind that the considered progenitors can reproduce the properties of the\nobserved helium DWDs in which the younger component is the more massive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 20:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

Among luminous clusters there is a\ncorrelation in the sense that the oldest clusters are slightly more metal\ndeficient than are younger clusters. However, no such clear-cut relationship is\nfound among the faintest globular clusters. The central concentration index C\nof globular clusters is seen to be independent of metallicity. The dependence\nof the half-light radii of globular clusters on their Galactocentric distances\ncan be approximated by the relation $R_h \\alpha R^{2/3}_{gc}$. Clusters with\ncollapsed cores are mostly situated close to the Galactic nucleus. For $R_{gc}\n< 10$ kpc the luminosities and the radii of clusters appear to be uncorrelated.\nThe Galaxy differs from the LMC and the SMC in that it appears to lack highly\nflattened luminous clusters. Galactic globular clusters with ages $\\geq$ 13.0\nGyr are all of Oosterhoff type II, whereas almost all of those with ages $<$\n13.0 Gyr have been assigned to Oosterhoff type I. Globular clusters with ages\n$<$11.5 Gyr are all located in the outer Galactic halo, have below-average\nluminosities and above-average radii. On the other hand the very old globular\ncluster NGC 6522 is situated close to the Galactic nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 22:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

For all SSRQs studied,\nwe detect variations in r band flux of overall amplitude between 0.22 mag and\n0.92 mag in different sources. Eight of 18 SSRQs display a bluer-when-brighter\n(BWB) trend.

We find that a test particle\nmoves in the bulk and is not restricted on a 3-brane (to be taken as our\nuniverse). On the 3-brane, the test particle moves with uniform velocity,\ngiving the appearance that it is not subject to a force. But computing the\nparticle's energy using the energy-momentum tensor yields a time-dependent\nenergy that suggests a time-dependent mass. Thus, the extra force, which is the\neffect of the warped extra dimension on the particle's motion on the 3-brane,\ndoes not change the velocity but the mass of the particle. The particle's\nmotion in the bulk also results in a time-dependent modification of the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle as viewed on the 3-brane. These two results\nshow that the classical physics along the extra dimension results in the\ntime-dependence of particle masses and the uncertainty principle. If the\nparticle masses are time-independent and the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle\nis to remain unchanged, then there must be a non-gravitational force that will\nrestrict all particles on the 3-brane. Finally, we just note that although\nclassically, these time-dependent corrections on the 3-brane can be removed,\nquantum mechanical corrections along the extra dimension will restore back the\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 06:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

We have\nalso measured the bulge stellar velocity dispersions using the Ca II Triplet\nlines and plotted these galaxies on the M-sigma plot. We find that all the\nthree galaxies UGC 6614, UGC 6968 and F568-6 lie below the M-sigma relation for\nnearby galaxies. Thus we find that although the bulges of LSB galaxies may be\nwell evolved, their nuclear black hole masses are lower than those found in\nbright galaxies and lie offset from the M-sigma correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 07:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Extending our previous works, we\ndeveloped further a method to reconstruct for the first time the full\nthree-dimensional structure (triaxial shape and principal axis orientation) of\nboth DM and intracluster (IC) gas, and the level of non-thermal pressure of the\nIC gas.

The Power Spectral\nDensity (PSD) of this is typically fit by a phenomenological model of multiple\nLorentzians for both the broad band noise and Quasi-Periodic Oscillations\n(QPOs). Our previous paper (Ingram & Done 2011) developed the first physical\nmodel for the PSD and fit this to observational data. This was based on the\nsame truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry which can explain the correlated\nproperties of the energy spectra. This assumes that the broad band noise is\nfrom propagating fluctuations in mass accretion rate within the hot flow, while\nthe QPO is produced by global Lense-Thirring precession of the same hot flow.\n  Here we develop this model, making some significant improvements. Firstly we\nspecify that the viscous frequency (equivalently, surface density) in the hot\nflow has the same form as that measured from numerical simulations of\nprecessing, tilted accretion flows. Secondly, we refine the statistical\ntechniques which we use to fit the model to the data. We re-analyse the PSD\nfrom the 1998 rise to outburst of XTE J1550-564 with our new model in order to\nassess the impact of these changes. We find that the derived outer radii of the\nhot flow (set by the inner radius of the truncated disc) are rather similar,\nchanging from ~68-13 Rg throughout the outburst rise. However, the more\nphysical assumptions of our new model also allow us to constrain the scale\nheight of the flow. This decreases as the outer radius of the flow decreases,\nas expected from the spectral evolution. The spectrum steepens in response to\nthe increased cooling as the as the truncation radius sweeps in, so gas\npressure support for the flow decreases.\n  The new model, propfluc, is publically available within the xspec spectral\nfitting package.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 08:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Small\nsub-mm size dust aggregates consisting of micron-size SiO$_2$ particles\nrandomly interacted with dust targets of varying initial conditions in a\ncontinuous sequence of independent collisions. Impact velocities were 7.7 m/s\non average and in the range expected for collisions with decimetre bodies in\nprotoplanetary discs.

All initially porous parts of the\nsurface, i.e. built from the slowly returning fragments, are compacted and\nfirmly attached to the underlying dust layers by the subsequent impacts. Growth\nis possible at impact angles from 0$^{\\circ}$ (central collision) to\n70$^{\\circ}$. No growth occurs at steeper dust surfaces. We measured the\nvelocity, angle, and size distribution of collision fragments. The average\nrestitution coefficient is 3.8% or 0.29 m/s ejection velocity. Ejecta sizes are\ncomparable to the projectile sizes. The high filling factor is close to the\nmost compact configuration of dust aggregates by local compression ($\\sim\n33$%). This implies that the history of the surface formation and target growth\nis completely erased. In view of this, the filling factor of 31% seems to be a\nuniversal value in the collision experiments of all self-consistently evolving\ntargets at the given impact velocities.

The\nvibrational frequency of the CO molecule was found to be very different for two\nnearly degenerate stable adsorption configurations of Au(5, 3), implying the\npossibility of distinguishing these two configurations via measuring the\nvibrational frequency of CO in experiments.

That is, as the peak\nflux of the pulsar approaches that of the system equivalent flux density,\nneither greater antenna gain nor increased instrumental bandwidth will improve\ntiming precision. These conclusions proceed from an analysis of the covariance\nmatrix used to characterise residual pulse profile fluctuations following the\ntemplate matching procedure for arrival time estimation. We perform such an\nanalysis on 25 hours of high-precision timing observations of the closest and\nbrightest millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715. In these data, the standard\ndeviation of the post-fit arrival time residuals is approximately four times\ngreater than that predicted by considering the system equivalent flux density,\nmean pulsar flux and the effective width of the pulsed emission. We develop a\ntechnique based on principal component analysis to mitigate the effects of\nshape variations on arrival time estimation and demonstrate its validity using\na number of illustrative simulations. When applied to our observations, the\nmethod reduces arrival time residual noise by approximately 20%. We conclude\nthat, owing primarily to the intrinsic variability of the radio emission from\nPSR J0437-4715 at 20 cm, timing precision in this observing band better than 30\n- 40 ns in one hour is highly unlikely, regardless of future improvements in\nantenna gain or instrumental bandwidth.

In addition to nuclear structure, GT transitions in nuclei\ndirectly affect the early phases of Type Ia and Type-II supernovae core\ncollapse since the electron capture rates are partly determined by these GT\ntransitions. In astrophysics, GT transitions provide an important input for\nmodel calculations and element formation during the explosive phase of a\nmassive star at the end of its life-time. Recent nucleosynthesis calculations\nshow that odd-odd and odd-A nuclei cause the largest contribution in the rate\nof change of lepton-to-baryon ratio. In the present manuscript, we have\ncalculated the GT strength distributions and electron capture rates for odd-odd\nnucleus 50V by using the pn-QRPA theory. At present 50V is the first\nexperimentally available odd-odd nucleus in fp-shell nuclei. We also compare\nour GT strength distribution with the recently measured results of a\n50V(d,2He)50Ti experiment, with the earlier work of Fuller, Fowler, and Newman\n(referred to as FFN) and subsequently with the large-scale shell model\ncalculations. One curious finding of the paper is that the Brink's hypothesis,\nusually employed in large-scale shell model calculations, is not a good\napproximation to use at least in the case of 50V. SNe Ia model calculations\nperformed using FFN rates result in overproduction of 50Ti, and were brought to\na much acceptable value by employing shell model results. It might be\ninteresting to study how the composition of the ejecta using presently reported\nQRPA rates compare with the observed abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 11:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

The systematic comparison\nshows that the model description of inhomogeneous nuclear matter is as\nimportant as the parameterization of the nuclear interactions for the supernova\ndynamics and the neutrino signal. Furthermore, several new aspects of nuclear\nphysics are investigated: the HS EOS contains distributions of nuclei,\nincluding nuclear shell effects. The appearance of light nuclei, e.g.,\ndeuterium and tritium is also explored, which can become as abundant as alphas\nand free protons. In addition, we investigate the black hole formation in\nfailed core-collapse supernovae, which is mainly determined by the high-density\nEOS. We find that temperature effects lead to a systematically faster collapse\nfor the non-relativistic LS EOS in comparison to the RMF EOS. We deduce a new\ncorrelation for the time until black hole formation, which allows to determine\nthe maximum mass of proto-neutron stars, if the neutrino signal from such a\nfailed supernova would be measured in the future.

In this\npaper we show that the asymptotic conditional distribution of exceedance counts\n(ACDEC) $p_k=\\lim_{s\\nearrow}P(N_s=k\\mid N_s>0)$, $1\\le k\\le d$, exists, if the\ncopula of $\\bm X$ is in the domain of attraction of a multivariate extreme\nvalue distribution, and if\n$\\lim_{s\\nearrow}(1-F_i(s))/(1-F_\\kappa(s))=\\gamma_i\\in[0,\\infty)$ exists for\n$1\\le i\\le d$ and some $\\kappa\\in{1,...,d}$. This enables the computation of\nthe FI corresponding to $\\bm X$ and of the extended FI as well as of the\nasymptotic distribution of the exceedance cluster length also in that case,\nwhere the components of $\\bm X$ are not identically distributed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 14:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-09"}

This is closely related to\nthe fact that correlation functions can only depend on the de Sitter invariant\ndistances. These properties follow from the isometries of the inflationary de\nSitter space and are thus completely independent of the dynamics. The 3-point\nfunction is fixed in terms of two constants, while the 4-point function is a\nfunction of two parameters (instead of five as in the absence of conformal\ninvariance). The conformal invariance of correlators can be directly checked in\nFourier space, as we show in an explicit example. A detection of a\nnon-conformal correlation function, for example an equilateral 3-point\nfunction, would imply that the source of perturbations is not decoupled from\nthe inflaton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 15:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 09:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}
