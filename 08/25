Rev. B {\\bf 84}, 014512 (2011)]. The BEC\nthat is obtained at large gauge coupling strengths is a condensate of tightly\nbound bosonic fermion-pairs whose properties are solely determined by the\nRashba gauge field -- hence called rashbons. In this paper, we conduct a\nsystematic study of the properties of rashbons and their dispersion. This study\nreveals a new qualitative aspect of the problem of interacting fermions in\nnon-Abelian gauge fields, i.e., that the rashbon state induced by the gauge\nfield for small centre of mass momenta of the fermions ceases to exist when\nthis momentum exceeds a critical value which is of the order of the gauge\ncoupling strength. The study allows us to estimate the transition temperature\nof the rashbon BEC, and suggests a route to enhance the exponentially small\ntransition temperature of the system with a fixed weak attraction to the order\nof the Fermi temperature by tuning the strength of the non-Abelian gauge field.\nThe nature of the rashbon dispersion, and in particular the absence of the\nrashbon states at large momenta, suggests a regime of parameter space where the\nnormal state of the system will be a dynamical mixture of uncondensed rashbons\nand unpaired helical fermions. Such a state should show many novel features\nincluding pseudogap physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 16:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-02"}

We address this problem by introducing\nGrid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST), which discretizes the equations of\nInhomogeneous Solvation Theory on a 3D grid in a volume of interest. Here, the\nsolvent volume is divided into small grid boxes and localized thermodynamic\nentropies, energies and free energies are defined for each grid box.\nThermodynamic solvation quantities are defined in such a manner that summing\nthe quantities over all the grid boxes yields the desired total quantity for\nthe system. This approach smoothly accounts for the thermodynamics of not only\nhighly occupied water sites but also partly occupied and water depleted regions\nof the solvent, without the need for ad hoc terms drawn from other theories.\nThe GIST method has the further advantage of allowing a rigorous end-states\nanalysis that, for example in the problem of molecular recognition, can account\nfor not only the thermodynamics of displacing water from the surface but also\nfor the thermodynamics of solvent reorganization around the bound complex. As a\npreliminary application, we present GIST calculations at the 1-body level for\nthe host cucurbit[7]uril, a low molecular weight receptor molecule which\nrepresents a tractable model for biomolecular recognition. One of the most\nstriking results is the observation of a toroidal region of water density, at\nthe center of the host's nonpolar cavity, which is significantly disfavored\nentropically, and hence may contribute to the ability of this small receptor to\nbind guest molecules with unusually high affinities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 16:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

In\nlight of the increasing interest in uncertainty quantification and robust\ndesign applications in aerospace engineering, the calculation of expected\nvalues of such functions (e.g. performance measures) becomes important.\nHowever, MC techniques often suffer from high variance and slow convergence as\nthe number of samples increases. In this paper we present Stacked Monte Carlo\n(StackMC), a new method for post-processing an existing set of MC samples to\nimprove the associated integral estimate. StackMC is based on the supervised\nlearning techniques of fitting functions and cross validation. It should reduce\nthe variance of any type of Monte Carlo integral estimate (simple sampling,\nimportance sampling, quasi-Monte Carlo, MCMC, etc.) without adding bias. We\nreport on an extensive set of experiments confirming that the StackMC estimate\nof an integral is more accurate than both the associated unprocessed Monte\nCarlo estimate and an estimate based on a functional fit to the MC samples.\nThese experiments run over a wide variety of integration spaces, numbers of\nsample points, dimensions, and fitting functions. In particular, we apply\nStackMC in estimating the expected value of the fuel burn metric of future\ncommercial aircraft and in estimating sonic boom loudness measures. We compare\nthe efficiency of StackMC with that of more standard methods and show that for\nnegligible additional computational cost significant increases in accuracy are\ngained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 16:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

To provide an empirical basis for\nmodeling the coevolution of dust and MRI, we perform three-dimensional,\nohmic-resistive MHD simulations of a vertically stratified shearing box with an\nMRI-inactive \"dead zone\" of various sizes and with a net vertical magnetic flux\nof various strengths. We find that the vertical structure of turbulence is well\ncharacterized by the vertical magnetic flux and three critical heights derived\nfrom the linear analysis of MRI in a stratified disk. In particular, the\nturbulent structure depends on the resistivity profile only through the\ncritical heights and is insensitive to the details of the resistivity profile.\nWe discover scaling relations between the amplitudes of various turbulent\nquantities (velocity dispersion, density fluctuation, vertical diffusion\ncoefficient, and outflow mass flux) and vertically integrated accretion\nstresses. We also obtain empirical formulae for the integrated accretion\nstresses as a function of the vertical magnetic flux and the critical heights.\nThese empirical relations allow to predict the vertical turbulent structure of\na protoplanetary disk for a given strength of the magnetic flux and a given\nresistivity profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 17:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Traveling-wave solutions to these PDEs are typically\nconcentrated on velocities and their dependence on the various parameters. Most\nof the investigations into the dynamical interaction of virus and defective\ninterfering particles (DIP), which are incomplete forms of the virus that\nreplicate through co-infection, have followed the same lines. In this work we\npresent an agent based model of viral infection with consideration of DIP and\nthe negative feedback loop introduced by interferon production as part of the\nhost innate immune response. The model is based high resolution microscopic\nimages of plaques of dead cells we took from mammalian cells infected with\nSendai virus with low and high DIP. In order to investigate the effects of the\ndiscrete stochastic microscopic mechanisms, which are responsible for virus\nspreading, have on the macroscopic growth of viral plaques, we generate an\nagent-based model of viral infection. The two main aims of this work are to (i)\ninvestigate the effects of discrete microscopic randomness on the macroscopic\ngrowth of viral plaques; and (ii) examine the dynamic interactions between the\nfull length virus, DIP and interferon, and interpret what may be the function\nof DIP. We find that we can explain the qualitative differences between our\nstochastic model and deterministic models in terms of the fractal geometry of\nthe resulting plaques, and that DIP have a delaying effect while the\ninteraction between interferon and DIP has a slowing effect on the growth of\nviral plaques, potentially contributing to viral latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 18:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

As a result, it would enhance optical phase estimation with\nthese states as well as distinguishability of \"macroscopic\" qubits. We propose\nan optical scheme, which is a relatively simple, albeit non-ideal, operational\nimplementation of such a filter. It uses tapping of the original polarization\ntwo-mode field, with a polarization neutral beam splitter of low reflectivity.\nNext, the reflected beams are suitably interfered on a polarizing beam\nsplitter. It is oriented such that it selects unbiased polarization modes with\nrespect to the original ones.

This effect is especially pronounced for highly populated\nstates. Additionally, for such states we expect strong population correlations\nbetween the original fields and the tapped one. Thus, after a photon-number\nmeasurement of the polarizing beam splitter outputs, a feed-forward loop can be\nused to let through a shutter the field, which was transmitted by the tapping\nbeam splitter.

We calculate the amplitude of the\ntidally excited gravity waves as a function of the tidal forcing frequency\n\\omega=2(\\Omega-\\Omega_s) (where \\Omega is the orbital frequency and \\Omega_s\nis the spin frequency) for several realistic carbon-oxygen WD models, assuming\nthat the waves are efficiently dissipated in the outer layer of the star by\nnonlinear effects or radiative damping. The mechanism of wave excitation in WDs\nis complex due to the sharp features associated with composition changes inside\nthe WD, and in our WD models gravity waves are launched just below the\nhelium-carbon boundary. We find that the tidal torque on the WD and the related\ntidal energy transfer rate, \\dot E_{\\rm tide}, depend on \\omega in an erratic\nway. On average, \\dot E_{\\rm tide} scales approximately as \\Omega^5\\omega^5 for\na large range of tidal frequencies. We also study the effects of dynamical\ntides on the long-term evolution of WD binaries. Above a critical orbital\nfrequency \\Omega_c, corresponding to an orbital period of order one hour\n(depending on WD models), dynamical tides efficiently drive \\Omega_s toward\n\\Omega, although a small, almost constant degree of asynchronization\n(\\Omega-\\Omega_s\\sim {\\rm constant}) is maintained even at the smallest binary\nperiods. While the orbital decay is always dominated by gravitational\nradiation, the tidal energy transfer can induce significant phase error in the\nlow-frequency gravitational waveforms, detectable by the planned LISA project.\nTidal dissipation may also lead to significant heating of the WD envelope and\nbrightening of the system long before binary merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 18:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 17:18:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 03:19:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 18:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 17:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The density, a macroscopic variable, needs\nto be mapped to the distribution functions, mesoscopic variables, of the\nlattice Boltzmann model. Several methods proposed as lifting operators have\nbeen tested and discussed in the literature. The most famous methods are an\nanalytically found lifting operator, like the Chapman-Enskog expansion, and a\nnumerical method, like the Constrained Runs algorithm, to arrive at an implicit\nexpression for the unknown distribution functions with the help of the density.\nThis paper proposes a lifting operator that alleviates several drawbacks of\nthese existing methods. In particular, we focus on the computational expense\nand the analytical work that needs to be done. The proposed lifting operator, a\nnumerical Chapman-Enskog expansion, obtains the coefficients of the\nChapman-Enskog expansion numerically. Another important feature of the use of\nlifting operators is found in hybrid models. There the lattice Boltzmann model\nis spatially coupled with a model based on a more macroscopic description, for\nexample an advection-diffusion-reaction equation. In one part of the domain,\nthe lattice Boltzmann model is used, while in another part, the more\nmacroscopic model.

However, if we accept that the\naccelerated expansion led the universe into an essentially homogeneous and\nisotropic space-time, with the state of all the matter fields in their vacuum\n(except for the zero mode of the inflaton field), we can not escape the\nconclusion that the state of the universe as a whole would remain always\nhomogeneous and isotropic.

The present work takes an analytical approach to account for\ndiscrete molecular forces in the nanopore fluid and proposes two related\nmechanisms that can explain the hysteresis at low vapor pressure without\nassuming any change in the nanopore structure. The first mechanism, presented\nin Part I, consists of a series of snap-through instabilities during the\nfilling or emptying of non-uniform nanopores or nanoscale asperities. The\ninstabilities are caused by non-uniqueness in the misfit disjoining pressures\nengendered by a difference between the nanopore width and an integer multiple\nof the thickness of a monomolecular adsorption layer. The second mechanism,\npresented in Part II, consists of molecular coalescence within a partially\nfilled surface, nanopore or nanopore network. This general thermodynamic\ninstability is driven by attractive intermolecular forces within the adsorbate\nand forms the basis to develop a unified theory of both mechanisms. The\nultimate goals of the theory are to predict the fluid transport in nanoporous\nsolids from microscopic first principles, and to determine the pore size\ndistribution and internal surface area from sorption tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 20:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We show that this model\nis not related to QRC by a naive Wick rotation; this serves as another\ndemonstration that the sum over Lorentzian geometries is not simply related to\nthe sum over Euclidean geometries. By removing the triangle inequality\nconstraints, there is more freedom to perform analytical calculations, and in\naddition numerical simulations are more computationally efficient.\n  We first formulate the model in 1+1 dimensions, and derive scaling relations\nfor the pure gravity path integral on the torus using two different measures.\nIt appears relatively easy to generate \"large\" universes, both in spatial and\ntemporal extent. In addition, loop-to-loop amplitudes are discussed, and a\ntransfer matrix is derived. We then also discuss the model in higher\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 23:02:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 22:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-18"}

Through these processes, this work\nexplored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which\nthe interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected\nreactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An\nimportant prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel\nconsistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that\nunlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the\ninteraction. For such models both channels should have the same strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 00:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-26"}

Chain conformations are found to have\na sensitive dependence on salt concentration $C_s$. As $C_s$ is increased, the\nchains first shrink to a globular structure and subsequently reexpand above a\ncritical concentration $C_s^*$. An external electric field can further alter\nthe chain conformation. If the field strength $E$ is larger than a critical\nvalue $E^*$, the chains are elongated. $E^*$ is shown to be a function of $C_s$\nby using two estimators $E_{I}^*$ and $E_{II}^*$ through the study of the\npolarization energy and the onset point of chain unfolding, respectively. The\nelectrophoretic mobility of the chains depends strongly on $C_s$, and the\nmagnitude increases significantly, accompanying the chain unfolding, when $E>\nE_{II}^*$. We study the condensed ion distributions modified by electric fields\nand discuss the connection of the modification with the change of chain\nmorphology and mobility. Finally, $E^*$ is studied by varying the chain length\n$N$. The inflection point is used as a third estimator $E_{III}^*$. $E_{III}^*$\nscales as $N^{-0.63(4)}$ and $N^{-0.76(2)}$ at $C_s=0.0$ and $C_s^*$,\nrespectively. $E_{II}^*$ follows a similar scaling law to $E_{III}^*$ but a\ncrossover appears at $C_s=C_s^*$ when $N$ is small. The $E_{I}^*$ estimator\nfails to predict the critical field, which is due to oversimplifying the\ncritical polarization energy to the thermal energy. Our results provide\nvaluable information to understand the electrokinetics of PE solutions at the\nmolecular level and could be helpful in micro/nano-fluidics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 05:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-26"}

Here\nwe develop a method to study the CSFR from a purely theoretical point of view.\nStarting from detailed models of chemical evolution, which best fit the\nproperties of local galaxies, we obtain the histories of star formation of\ngalaxies of different morphological types (ellipticals, spirals, irregulars).\nThese histories are then used to determine the photometric evolution of\ngalaxies by means of a spectro-photometric code. The next step in computing the\nCSFR is the calculation of the luminosity density for which we need to know how\ngalaxies are distributed in the Universe at any redshift. This is possible\nthanks to the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies. At this point we calculate\nthe CSFR under different evolutionary scenarios. First, we study the hypothesis\nof a pure luminosity evolution scenario, in which galaxies are supposed to form\nall at the same redshift and then evolve only in luminosity without any merging\nor interaction. In other words, we assume no number density evolution. Then we\ndefine scenarios in which the number density and the slope of the LF are\nassumed to vary with redshift.

On the other hand, a variation in the\nnumber density for ellipticals and spirals as a function of redshift can\nprovide a better fit to the observed CSFR, although the data at very high\nredshift are still quite uncertain and this solution predicts that most of the\nmetals in the Universe have been produced by spirals, a prediction which still\nneeds to be tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 08:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-26"}

Particular attention is paid to the erosion and\ndeposition of the substrate particles, including application of an active layer\nmodel. Multiple flows are modeled from a lock release that can show the\ndevelopment of sediment waves (SW).

We find the positions of the main periodic orbits as functions of\nLz and E, and their bifurcations. Around the main periodic orbit of the outer\nregion there are islands of stability that do not appear in the Kerr metric. In\na realistic binary system, because of the gravitational radiation, the energy E\nand the angular momentum Lz of an inspiraling compact object decrease and\ntherefore the orbit of the object is non-geodesic. In fact in an EMRI system\nthe energy E and the angular momentum Lz decrease adiabatically and therefore\nthe motion of the inspiraling object is characterized by the fundamental\nfrequencies which are drifting slowly in time. In the Kerr metric the ratio of\nthe fundamental frequencies changes strictly monotonically in time. However, in\nthe MN metric when an orbit is trapped inside an island the ratio of the\nfundamental frequencies remains constant for some time.

The resulting category is shown\nto be a fixpoint category, i.e. a cartesian category which is traced wrt the\nmonoidal structure given by the product, and interestingly this structure\ncharacterizes the category: we show that it is the free fixpoint category\ncontaining a given set of morphisms, thus providing a complete axiomatics that\nmodels of process networks should satisfy. We then use these tools to build a\nmodel of networks in which data vary over a continuous time, in order to\nelaborate on the idea that process networks should also be able to encompass\ncomputational models such as hybrid systems or electric circuits. We relate\nthis model to Kahn's semantics by introducing a third model of networks based\non non-standard analysis, whose elements form an internal complete partial\norder for which many properties of standard domains can be reformulated. The\nuse of hyperreals in this model allows it to formally consider the notion of\ninfinitesimal, and thus to make a bridge between discrete and continuous time:\ntime is \"discrete\", but the duration between two instants is infinitesimal.\nFinally, we give some examples of uses of the model by describing some networks\nimplementing common constructions in analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 11:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-07"}

Such operations describe discrete time evolution of an open quantum\nsystem interacting with an environment. The thesis contains an analysis of\nproperties of quantum channels and different entropies used to quantify the\ndecoherence introduced into the system by a given operation. Part I of the\nthesis provides a general introduction to the subject. In Part II, the action\nof a quantum channel is treated as a process of preparation of a quantum\nensemble. The Holevo information associated with this ensemble is shown to be\nbounded by the entropy exchanged during the preparation process between the\ninitial state and the environment. A relation between the Holevo information\nand the entropy of an auxiliary matrix consisting of square root fidelities\nbetween the elements of the ensemble is proved in some special cases. Weaker\nbounds on the Holevo information are also established. The entropy of a\nchannel, also called the map entropy, is defined as the entropy of the state\ncorresponding to the channel by the Jamiolkowski isomorphism. In Part III of\nthe thesis, the additivity of the entropy of a channel is proved. The minimal\noutput entropy, which is difficult to compute, is estimated by an entropy of a\nchannel which is much easier to obtain. A class of quantum channels is\nspecified, for which additivity of channel capacity is conjectured. The last\npart of the thesis contains characterization of Davies channels, which\ncorrespond to an interaction of a state with a thermal reservoir in the week\ncoupling limit, under the condition of quantum detailed balance and\nindependence of rotational and dissipative evolutions.

This is in contrast to the acoustic gravity\nemerging in Bose-Einstein condensates, where the \"value of this constant cannot\nbe easily predicted by just looking at the ground state energy of the\nmicroscopic system from which spacetime and its dynamics should emerge\" (S.\nFinazzi, S.

The advantage\nof topological matter is that the relativistic fermions and gauge bosons\nemerging near the Weyl point obey the same effective metric and thus the\neffective gravity is more closely related to real gravity. We study this\nconnection in the bi-metric gravity emerging in 3He-A, and its relation to the\ngraviton masses, by comparison with a fully relativistic bi-metric theory of\ngravity. This shows that the parameter \\lambda, which in 3He-A is the bi-metric\ngeneralization of the cosmological constant, coincides with the difference in\nthe proper energy of the vacuum in two states (the nonequilibrium state without\ngravity and the equilibrium state in which gravity emerges) and is on the order\nof the characteristic Planck energy scale of the system. Although the\ncosmological constant \\lambda\\ is huge, the cosmological term itself is\nnaturally non-constant and vanishes in the equilibrium vacuum, as dictated by\nthermodynamics.

As a matter of fact, recent investigations of transport\nthrough quantum chaotic systems have demonstrated the exponential suppression\nof the weak localization corrections to the conductance and of the Fano factor\nfor shot-noise when the Ehrenfest time exceeds the electronic dwell time. On\nthe other hand, conductance fluctuations, an effect of quantum coherence,\nretain their universal value in the limit of the ratio of Ehrenfest time over\ndwell time to infinity, when the system is ideally coupled to external leads.\nMotivated by this intriguing result we investigate conductance fluctuations\nthrough quantum chaotic cavities coupled to external leads via (tunnel)\nbarriers of arbitrary transparency. Using the trajectory-based semiclassical\ntheory of transport, we find a linear Ehrenfest time-dependence of the\nconductance variance showing a nonmonotonous, sinusoidal behavior as a function\nof the transperancy. Most notably, we find an increase of the conductance\nfluctuations with the Ehrenfest time, above their universal value, for the\ntransparency less than 0.5.

We implement Elliott-Yafet type\nspin-flip scattering, mediated by electron-electron and electron-phonon\ncollisions, into the framework of a spin-resolved Boltzmann equation.\nConsidering three mutually coupled reservoirs, (i) spin-up electrons, (ii)\nspin-down electrons and (iii) phonons, we trace non-equilibrium electron\ndistributions during and after laser excitation. We identify the driving force\nfor ultrafast magnetization dynamics as the equilibration of temperatures and\nchemical potentials between the electronic subsystems. This principle can be\nused to easily predict the maximum quenching of magnetization upon ultrashort\nlaser irradiation in any material, as we show for the example of\n3d-ferromagnetic nickel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 12:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-29"}

In particular the fine granularity of the location\ndata, with GPS accuracy down to 10 meters, and the worldwide scale of\nFoursquare adoption are unprecedented. In this paper we study urban mobility\npatterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing\na large set of Foursquare users. Surprisingly, while there are variations in\nhuman movement in different cities, our analysis shows that those are\npredominantly due to different distributions of places across different urban\nenvironments. Moreover, a universal law for human mobility is identified, which\nisolates as a key component the rank-distance, factoring in the number of\nplaces between origin and destination, rather than pure physical distance, as\nconsidered in some previous works. Building on our findings, we also show how a\nrank-based movement model accurately captures real human movements in different\ncities. Our results shed new light on the driving factors of urban human\nmobility, with potential applications for urban planning, location-based\nadvertisement and even social studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 19:49:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 14:37:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 20:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 07:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
