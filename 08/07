In this\npaper, we propose a model for longitudinal data which is based on a mixture of\nAR(1) processes with different means and correlation coefficients, but with\nequal variances. This model belongs to the class of models based on a\ncontinuous latent process, and then it has a natural interpretation in many\ncontexts of application, but it is more flexible than other models in this\nclass, reaching a goodness-of-fit similar to that of a discrete latent process\nmodel, with a reduced number of parameters. We show how to perform maximum\nlikelihood estimation of the proposed model by the joint use of an\nExpectation-Maximisation algorithm and a Newton-Raphson algorithm, implemented\nby means of recursions developed in the hidden Markov literature.

We introduce a macroscopic-frame vector\n(MFV) to specify the local rest frame (LRF) on which the macroscopic dynamics\nis described. The five hydrodynamic modes are identified with the same number\nof the zero modes of the linearized collision operator, i.e., the collision\ninvariants. After defining the inner product in the function space spanned by\nthe distribution function, the higher-order terms, which give rise to the\ndissipative effects, are constructed so that they are orthogonal to the zero\nmodes in terms of the inner product: Here, any ansatz's, such as the so-called\nconditions of fit used in the standard methods in an ad-hoc way, are not\nnecessary. We elucidate that the Burnett term dose not affect the RDHEs owing\nto the very nature of the hydrodynamic modes as the zero modes. Applying the RG\nequation, we obtain the RDHE in a generic LRF specified by the MFV, as the\ncoarse-grained and covariant equation. Our generic RDHE reduces to RDHEs in\nvarious LRFs, including the energy and particle LRFs with a choice of the MFV.\nWe find that our RDHE in the energy LRF coincides with that of Landau and\nLifshitz, while the derived RDHE in the particle LRF is slightly different from\nthat of Eckart, owing to the presence of the dissipative internal energy. We\nprove that the Eckart equation can not be compatible with the underlying RBE.\nThe proof is made on the basis of the observation that the orthogonality\ncondition to the zero modes coincides with the ansatz's posed on the\ndissipative parts of the energy-momentum tensor and the particle current in the\nphenomenological RDHEs. We also present an analytic proof that all of our RDHEs\nhave a stable equilibrium state owing to the positive definiteness of the inner\nproduct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2011 00:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-03"}

These issues that put severe constraints on the\ndevice applications of MMs could be overcome if semiconductors are used as\nplasmonic materials instead of metals. Heavily doped, wide bandgap oxide\nsemiconductors could exhibit both a small negative real permittivity and\nrelatively small losses in the NIR. Heavily doped oxides of zinc and indium\nwere already reported to be good, low loss alternatives to metals in the NIR\nrange. Here, we consider these transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) as\nalternative plasmonic materials for many specific applications ranging from\nsurface-plasmon-polariton waveguides to MMs with hyperbolic dispersion and\nepsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. We show that TCOs outperform conventional\nmetals for ENZ and other MM-applications in the NIR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2011 07:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-08"}

Real examples of SGS in the universe are globular clusters\nand galaxies. The idea is to represent an interaction by which a particle of\nthe system is affected from the others by a special random force. That is, we\nwill use a special Langevin equation, just as the normal Langevin equation can\nunveil the dynamics toward the steady state described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribution. However, we cannot introduce the randomness into the system\nwithout any evidence. Then, we must confirm that each orbit is random indeed.\nOf course, it is impossible to understand orbits of stars in globular clusters\nfrom observations. Thus we use numerical simulations. From the numerical\nsimulations of SGS, grounds that we use the random noise become clear. The\nspecial Langevin equation includes the additive and the multiplicative noise.\nBy using the random process, we derive the non-Maxwellian distribution of SGS\nespecially around the core. The number density can be obtained through the\nsteady state solution of the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the random\nprocess. We exhibit that the number density becomes equal to the density\nprofiles around the core by adjusting the friction coefficient and the\nintensity of the multiplicative noise. Moreover, we also show that our model\ncan be applied in the system which has a heavier particle, corresponding to the\nblack hole in a globular cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2011 07:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-09"}

They\nare the most luminous objects detected so far within ~ 100 Mpc, the horizon\ndistance of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), so they are considered to\nbe candidate sources of UHECRs. It was recently argued that the energy\nproduction rate in UHECRs is much larger than that in gamma-ray photons of long\nGRBs measured by the Fermi satellite, which, if true, would challenge the view\nthat GRBs can be the sources of UHECRs. We here suggest that many of the low\nluminosity GRBs, due to their low luminosity, can not trigger the current GRB\ndetectors and hence their contribution to the local gamma-ray energy production\nrate is missing. We find that the real local energy production rate by\nlow-luminosity GRBs, taking into account the missing part, which constitutes a\ndominant fraction of the total amount, could be sufficient to account for the\nflux of UHECRs. Due to the low-luminosity, only intermediate-mass or heavy\nnuclei can be accelerated to ~ 10^20 eV. We discuss the acceleration and\nsurvival of these UHE nuclei in low-luminosity GRBs, especially in those\nmissing low-luminosity GRBs. At last, the accompanying diffuse neutrino flux\nfrom the whole low-luminosity GRB population is calculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2011 15:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The degree-two component of the\nalgebra contains a 2-dimensional subspace of central elements. The zero loci of\nthose central elements, except 0, form a pencil of non-commutative quadric\nsurfaces, We show that the behavior of this pencil is similar to that of a\ngeneric pencil of quadrics in the commutative projective 3-space. There are\nexactly four singular quadrics in the pencil. The singular and non-singular\nquadrics are characterized by whether they have one or two rulings by\nnon-commutative lines. The Picard groups of the smooth quadrics are free\nabelian of rank two. The alternating sum of dimensions of Ext groups allows us\nto define an intersection pairing on the Picard group of the smooth\nnoncommutative quadrics. A surprise is that a smooth noncommutative quadric can\nsometimes contain a \"curve\" having self-intersection number -2. Many of the\nmethods used in our paper are noncommutative versions of methods developed by\nBuchweitz, Eisenbud and Herzog: in particular, the correspondence between the\ngeometry of a quadric hypersurface and maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over its\nhomogeneous coordinate ring plays a key role. An important aspect of our work\nis to introduce definitions of non-commutative analogues of the familiar\ncommutative terms used in this abstract. We expect the ideas we develop here\nfor 2-dimensional non-commutative quadric hypersurfaces will apply to higher\ndimensional non-commutative quadric hypersurfaces and we develop them in\nsufficient generality to make such applications possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2011 15:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-09"}
