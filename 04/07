In order to\ninvestigate how the substrates may affect the magnetic properties of the\nnanowires, here we systematically study the V, Cr and Mn linear atomic chains\non the Cu(001) surface based on the density functional theory with the\ngeneralized gradient approximation. We find that V, Cr, and Mn linear chains on\nthe Cu(001) surface still have a stable or metastable ferromagnetic state.\nHowever, the ferromagnetic state is unstable against formation of a\nnoncollinear spin-spiral structure in the Mn linear chains and also the V\nlinear chain on the atop sites on the Cu(001) surface, due to the frustrated\nmagnetic interactions in these systems. Nonetheless, the presence of the\nCu(001) substrate does destabilize the spin-spiral state already present in the\nfreestanding V linear chain and stabilizes the ferromagnetic state in the V\nlinear chain on the hollow sites on Cu(001). When spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is\nincluded, the spin magnetic moments remain almost unchanged, due to the\nweakness of SOC in 3d TM chains. Furthermore, both the orbital magnetic moments\nand MAEs for the V, Cr and Mn are small, in comparison with both the\ncorresponding freestanding nanowires and also the Fe, Co and Ni linear chains\non the Cu (001) surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2011 17:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

To explain\nthe existence of this peculiar system, two theories have been proposed. One\nsuggests that SDSS J1507+52 was formed from a detached white-dwarf/brown-dwarf\nbinary.

The UV flux of the system is dominated by emission from the accreting\nwhite dwarf.

The universal availability of the extended MET model is\nanalyzed in comparison to 24 existing empirical MET models.

We discuss some recent advances in this field,\nlike the occasional detection of the prompt emission at all wavelengths, from\noptical to GeV; the existence of sub-luminous GRBs; the attempts to standardize\nGRBs; and the possible detection of polarization in two very bright GRBs.\nDespite these advances, tantalizing observational and theoretical challenges\nstill exist, concerning the detection of the faintest GRBs, the panchromatic\nobservation of GRBs from their very beginning, the origin of the prompt\nemission, or the understanding of the physics at work during this phase.\nSignificant progress on this last topic is expected with SVOM thanks to the\nobservation of dozens of GRBs from optical to MeV during the burst itself, and\nthe measure of the redshift for the majority of them. SVOM will also change our\nview of the prompt GRB phase in another way. Within a few years, the\nsensitivity of sky surveys at optical and radio frequencies, and outside the\nelectromagnetic domain in gravitational waves or neutrinos, will allow them to\ndetect several new types of transient signals, and SVOM will be uniquely suited\nto identify which of these transients are associated with GRBs.

These\nsimulations are the first to include the feedback effects protostellar\noutflows, as well as protostellar radiative heating and radiation pressure\nexerted on the infalling, dusty gas. We find that that outflows evacuate polar\ncavities of reduced optical depth through the ambient core. These enhance the\nradiative flux in the poleward direction so that it is 1.7 to 15 times larger\nthan that in the midplane. As a result the radiative heating and outward\nradiation force exerted on the protostellar disk and infalling cloud gas in the\nequatorial direction are greatly diminished. The simultaneously reduces the\nEddington radiation pressure barrier to high-mass star formation and increases\nthe minimum threshold surface density for radiative heating to suppress\nfragmentation compared to models that do not include outflows. The strength of\nboth these effects depends on the initial core surface density. Lower surface\ndensity cores have longer free-fall times and thus massive stars formed within\nthem undergo more Kelvin contraction as the core collapses, leading to more\npowerful outflows. Furthermore, in lower surface density clouds the ratio of\nthe time required for the outflow to break out of the core to the core\nfree-fall time is smaller, so that these clouds are consequently influenced by\noutflows at earlier stages of collapse. As a result, outflow effects are\nstrongest in low surface density cores and weakest in high surface density one.\nWe also find that radiation focusing in the direction of outflow cavities is\nsufficient to prevent the formation of radiation pressure-supported\ncircumstellar gas bubbles, in contrast to models which neglect protostellar\noutflow feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2011 00:14:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2011 00:52:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 03:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This is done by considering the notion of a\ntranslation-like action. Translation-like actions were introduced by Kevin\nWhyte as a geometric analogue of subgroup containment. Whyte proved a geometric\nversion of the von Neumann Conjecture by showing that a finitely generated\ngroup is non-amenable if and only if it admits a translation-like action by any\n(equivalently every) non-abelian free group. We strengthen Whyte's result by\nproving that this translation-like action can be chosen to be transitive when\nthe acting free group is finitely generated. We furthermore prove that the\ngeometric version of Burnside's Problem holds true. That is, every finitely\ngenerated infinite group admits a translation-like action by $\\Z$. This answers\na question posed by Whyte. In pursuit of these results we discover an\ninteresting property of Cayley graphs: every finitely generated infinite group\n$G$ has some Cayley graph having a regular spanning tree. This regular spanning\ntree can be chosen to have degree 2 (and hence be a bi-infinite Hamiltonian\npath) if and only if $G$ has finitely many ends, and it can be chosen to have\nany degree greater than 2 if and only if $G$ is non-amenable.

The long-distance interaction is mediated by\nGoldstone magnons, whose interaction is expressed in terms of the electron\nGreen's functions. There is also a Higgs mode, whose excitation energy can be\ncalculated. The case of fast magnons obeying linear dispersion relation in\nthree spatial dimensions admits nonperturbative treatment using the Gribov\nequation, and the solution exhibits singular behaviour which has an\ninterpretation as a tower of spin-1 electronic excitations. This occurs near\nthe Mott insulator state. The electrons are more free in the case of slow\nmagnons, where the perturbative corrections are less singular at the\nthresholds. We then turn our attention to the problem of high-Tc\nsuperconductivity, through the discussion of the stability of the\nantiferromagnetic ground state in two spatial dimensions.

We use the statistical manifolds associated with correlated and\nnon-correlated Gaussians to model the scattering induced quantum entanglement\nof two spinless, structureless, non-relativistic particles, the latter\nrepresented by minimum uncertainty Gaussian wave-packets.

The\nstellar spiral arms and the interstellar matter on average corotate in a\ngalactic potential at any radii.

We\npresent here observations of the symbiotic star candidate IPHAS\nJ205836.43+503307.2. The optical spectrum shows the combination of a number of\nemission lines, among which are the high-excitation species of [OIII], HeII,\n[Ca V], and [Fe VII], and a red continuum with the features of a star at the\ncool end of the carbon star sequence. The nebular component is spatially\nresolved: the analysis of the spatial profile of the [NII]6583 line in the\nspectrum indicates a linear size of ~2.5 arcsec along the east-west direction.\nIts velocity structure suggests an aspherical morphology. The near-infrared\nexcess of the source, which was especially strong in 1999, indicated that a\nthick circumstellar dust shell was also present in the system. The carbon star\nhas brightened in the last decade by two to four magnitudes at red and\nnear-infrared wavelengths. Photometric monitoring during a period of 60 days\nfrom November 2010 to January 2011 reveals a slow luminosity decrease of 0.2\nmagnitudes. From the observed spectrophotometric properties and variability, we\nconclude that the source is a new Galactic symbiotic star of the D-type, of the\nrare kind that contains a carbon star, likely a carbon Mira. Only two other\nsystems of this type are known in the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2011 10:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-08"}

With a generic non-resonance assumption, the normal form\nprovides k (approximate) integrals that describe the saddle dynamics in a\nneighborhood of the index k saddle. These integrals provide a symbolic\ndescription of all trajectories that pass through a neighborhood of the saddle.\nWe give a parametrization of the dividing surface which is used as the basis\nfor a numerical method to sample the dividing surface.

We\nfind that the observed large range of [OIII]5007A equivalent widths observed in\nthe sample (from a few A up to 500A) is well explained as a combination of an\nintrinsic spread, probably due to the large range of covering factors of the\nNarrow Line Region, and the effect of absorption. The intrinsic spread is\ndominant for EW below 40-50A while absorption brings the values of EW up to\n~100-150A, for moderate levels of absorption (AV~0.5-2 mag) or up to ~500A for\nAV>2 mag. In this picture, the absorption has a significant impact on the\nobserved EW also in type~1 AGN.

Given isolating intervals, our algorithm refines each of them\nto a width of $2^{-L}$ or less, that is, each of the roots is approximated to\n$L$ bits after the binary point. Our method provides a certified answer for\narbitrary real polynomials, only considering finite approximations of the\npolynomial coefficients and choosing a suitable working precision adaptively.\nIn this way, we get a correct algorithm that is simple to implement and\npractically efficient. Our algorithm uses the quadratic interval refinement\nmethod; we adapt that method to be able to cope with inaccuracies when\nevaluating $f$, without sacrificing its quadratic convergence behavior. We\nprove a bound on the bit complexity of our algorithm in terms of the degree of\nthe polynomial, the size and the separation of the roots, that is, parameters\nexclusively related to the geometric location of the roots. Our bound is near\noptimal and significantly improves previous work on integer polynomials.\nFurthermore, it essentially matches the best known theoretical bounds on root\napproximation which are obtained by very sophisticated algorithms.

This graph consists of an infinite\nchain of edges with the metric structure defined by assigning an interval\n$I_n=[0,l_n]$, $n\\in\\nz$, to each edge with length $l_n=\\frac{\\pi}{n}$. We show\nthat the one-parameter family of quantum graphs possesses a purely discrete and\nstrictly positive spectrum for each $\\kappa>0$ and prove that the Dirichlet\nLaplacian is the limit of the one-parameter family in the strong resolvent\nsense. The spectrum of the resulting Dirichlet quantum graph is also purely\ndiscrete. The eigenvalues are given by $\\lambda_n=n^2$, $n\\in\\nz$, with\nmultiplicities $d(n)$, where $d(n)$ denotes the divisor function.
