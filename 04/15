The probabilities of quantum theory turn out to be just ordinary\nrelative frequencies probabilities in these ensembles. Laws for the evolution\nof the beables of individual systems are given such that their ensemble\nrelative frequencies evolve in a way that reproduces the predictions of quantum\nmechanics. These laws are highly non-local and involve a new kind of\ninteraction between the members of an ensemble that define a quantum state.\nThese include a stochastic process by which individual systems copy the beables\nof other systems in the ensembles of which they are a member. The probabilities\nfor these copy processes do not depend on where the systems are in space, but\ndo depend on the distribution of beables in the ensemble. Macroscopic systems\nthen are distinguished by being large and complex enough that they have no\ncopies in the universe. They then cannot evolve by the copy law, and hence do\nnot evolve stochastically according to quantum dynamics. This implies novel\ndepartures from quantum mechanics for systems in quantum states that can be\nexpected to have few copies in the universe. At the same time, we are able to\nargue that the centre of masses of large macroscopic systems do satisfy\nNewton's laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 16:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The real data integration requires sustainable and reliable\npattern discovery to enable accurate content retrieval and to recognize pattern\nchanges from time to time; yet, extracting the structured data from web\ndocuments is still lacking from its accuracy. This paper proposes the bar-tree\nrepresentation to describe the whole pattern of web pages in an efficient way\nbased on the reverse algorithm. While previous algorithms always trace the\npattern and extract the region of interest from \\textit{top root}, the reverse\nalgorithm recognizes the pattern from the region of interest to both top and\nbottom roots simultaneously. The attributes are then extracted and labeled\nreversely from the region of interest of targeted contents. Since using\nconventional representations for the algorithm should require more\ncomputational power, the bar-tree method is developed to represent the\ngenerated patterns using bar graphs characterized by the depths and widths from\nthe document roots. We show that this representation is suitable for extracting\nthe data from the semi-structured web sources, and for detecting the template\nchanges of targeted pages.

In this paper, we\nextend previous work on an abstract model of city traffic to allow for multiple\nstreet intersections. We test a self-organizing method in our model, showing\nthat it is close to theoretical optima and superior to a traditional method of\ntraffic light coordination.\n  Abstract: The elementary cellular automaton following rule 184 can mimic\nparticles flowing in one direction at a constant speed. This automaton can\ntherefore model highway traffic. In a recent paper, we have incorporated\nintersections regulated by traffic lights to this model using exclusively\nelementary cellular automata. In such a paper, however, we only explored a\nrectangular grid. We now extend our model to more complex scenarios employing\nan hexagonal grid. This extension shows first that our model can readily\nincorporate multiple-way intersections and hence simulate complex scenarios. In\naddition, the current extension allows us to study and evaluate the behavior of\ntwo different kinds of traffic light controller for a grid of six-way streets\nallowing for either two or three street intersections: a traffic light that\ntries to adapt to the amount of traffic (which results in self-organizing\ntraffic lights) and a system of synchronized traffic lights with coordinated\nrigid periods (sometimes called the \"green wave\" method). We observe a tradeoff\nbetween system capacity and topological complexity. The green wave method is\nunable to cope with the complexity of a higher-capacity scenario, while the\nself-organizing method is scalable, adapting to the complexity of a scenario\nand exploiting its maximum capacity. Additionally, in this paper we propose a\nbenchmark, independent of methods and models, to measure the performance of a\ntraffic light controller comparing it against a theoretical optimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 16:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}

While the CO map of MHO 5 does not show\na clear structure of outflow, possibly due to environment gas, its\nposition-velocity diagram indicates two distinct blue- and redshifted\ncomponents. We therefore conclude that they are components of a bipolar\nmolecular outflow from MHO 5. We estimate an outflow mass of 7.0 x 10^-5 M_Sun\nand a mass-loss rate of 9.0 x 10^-10 M_Sun. These values are over two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the typical ones for T Tauri stars and somewhat weaker\nthan those we have observed in the young brown dwarf ISO-Oph 102 of 60 M_J in\nrho Ophiuchi. This makes MHO~5 the first young very low mass star showing a\nbipolar molecular outflow in Taurus. The detection boosts the scenario that\nvery low mass objects form like low-mass stars but in a version scaled down by\na factor of over 100.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 16:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The temperature of the Si clean surface preparation, the\nfinal high-temperature step of which is, as a rule, carried out directly in the\nMBE chamber just before the structure deposition, determines the compatibility\nof formation process of Ge-QD-array based devices with the CMOS manufacturing\ncycle.

This structure is inherent\nin the output from an increasing number of biomedical technologies, and a\nfunctional linear model is often used to estimate the relationship between the\npredictor functions and scalar responses. Common approaches to the ill-posed\nproblem of estimating a coefficient function typically involve two stages:\nregularization and estimation. Regularization is usually done via dimension\nreduction, projecting onto a predefined span of basis functions or a reduced\nset of eigenvectors (principal components). In contrast, we present a unified\napproach that directly incorporates spatial structure into the estimation\nprocess by exploiting the joint eigenproperties of the predictors and a linear\npenalty operator. In this sense, the components in the regression are\n`partially empirical' and the framework is provided by the generalized singular\nvalue decomposition (GSVD).

We\nassume that two polygon segments have already been brought close together for\nthe purpose of performing a strand passage, and model this using Theta-SAPs,\npolygons that contain the pattern Theta at a fixed location. It is proved that\nthe number of n-edge Theta-SAPs grows exponentially (with n) at the same rate\nas the total number of n-edge unknotted self-avoiding polygons, and that the\nsame holds for subsets of n-edge Theta-SAPs that yield a specific\nafter-strand-passage knot-type. Thus the probability of a given\nafter-strand-passage knot-type does not grow (or decay) exponentially with n,\nand we conjecture that instead it approaches a knot-type dependent amplitude\nratio lying strictly between 0 and 1. This is supported by critical exponent\nestimates obtained from a new maximum likelihood method for Theta-SAPs that are\ngenerated by a composite (aka multiple) Markov Chain Monte Carlo BFACF\nalgorithm. We also give strong numerical evidence that the after-strand-passage\nknotting probability depends on the local structure around the strand passage\nsite. Considering both the local structure and the crossing-sign at the strand\npassage site, we observe that the more \"compact\" the local structure, the less\nlikely the after-strand-passage polygon is to be knotted. This trend is\nconsistent with results from other strand-passage models, however, we are the\nfirst to note the influence of the crossing-sign information. Two measures of\n\"compactness\" are used: the size of a smallest polygon that contains the\nstructure and the structure's \"opening\" angle. The opening angle definition is\nconsistent with one that is measurable from single molecule DNA experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 18:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Although we cannot\nentirely rule out residual detector effects or a time-varying, high-altitude\ncloud layer in the planet's atmosphere as the cause of these variations, we\nconsider the occultation of active regions on the star in a subset of the\ntransit observations to be the most likely explanation. We reconcile the\npresence of magnetically active regions with the lack of significant visible or\ninfrared flux variations from the star by proposing that the star's spin axis\nis tilted with respect to our line of sight, and that the planet's orbit is\ntherefore likely to be misaligned. These observations serve to illustrate the\nchallenges associated with transmission spectroscopy of planets orbiting\nlate-type stars; we expect that other systems, such as GJ 1214, may display\ncomparably variable transit depths. Our measured 8 micron secondary eclipse\ndepths are consistent with a constant value, and we place a 1 sigma upper limit\nof 17% on changes in the planet's dayside flux in this band. Averaging over the\neleven visits gives us an improved estimate of 0.0452% +/- 0.0027% for the\nsecondary eclipse depth. We combine timing information from our observations\nwith previously published data to produce a refined orbital ephemeris, and\ndetermine that the best-fit transit and eclipse times are consistent with a\nconstant orbital period.

The profiles of\nthe H3+ R(3,3)l line, which is due only to gas in the GC, closely matches the\ndifferences between the H3+ R(1,1)l and CO line profiles, just as it does for\npreviously studied sightlines in the GC.

They are angularly very close to their parent star, which is several\nmagnitudes brighter. Direct imaging of exoplanets thus requires a dedicated\ninstrumentation with large telescopes and accurate wavefront control devices\nfor high-angular resolution and coronagraphs for attenuating the stellar light.\nCoronagraphs are usually chromatic and they cannot perform high-contrast\nimaging over a wide spectral bandwidth. That chromaticity will be critical for\nfuture instruments. Enlarging the coronagraph spectral range is a challenge for\nfuture exoplanet imaging instruments on both space-based and ground-based\ntelescopes. We propose the multi-stage four-quadrant phase mask that associates\nseveral monochromatic four-quadrant phase mask coronagraphs in series.\nMonochromatic device performance has already been demonstrated and the\nmanufacturing procedures are well-under control since their development for\nprevious instruments on VLT and JWST. The multi-stage implementation simplicity\nis thus appealing. We present the instrument principle and we describe the\nlaboratory performance for large spectral bandwidths and for both pupil shapes\nfor space- (off-axis telescope) and ground-based (E-ELT) telescopes. The\nmulti-stage four-quadrant phase mask reduces the stellar flux over a wide\nspectral range (30%) and it is a very good candidate to be associated with a\nspectrometer for future exoplanet imaging instruments in ground- and\nspace-based observatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

These\ndata suggest that a massive ejection of material from the companion star loaded\nthe accretion disc and the system responded with mass loss via different modes\nthat together comprise the flare phenomena. We find that archival data reveal\nsimilar behaviour, in that when the measured jet launch speed exceeds 0.29c\nthis is invariably simultaneous with, or a few days before, a radio flare. Thus\nwe surmise that a major flare consists of the overloading of the accretion\ndisc, resulting in the speeding up of the H-alpha rotation disc lines, followed\nby enhanced mass loss not just via its famous jets at higher-than-usual speeds\nbut also directly from its accretion disc's wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 20:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Based on the derived Mg and Si abundances, we argue that this high N/O\nratio cannot be the result of an initial low O content due to its location on\nthe disk of M33, known to present a steep metallicity gradient. In combination\nwith the He abundance, the most plausible interpretation is that UIT005 is in\nan advanced stage of evolution, showing in its surface N enrichment and O\ndepletion resulting from mixing with CNO processed material from the stellar\ninterior. A comparison with the predictions of current stellar evolutionary\nmodels indicates that there are significant discrepancies, in particular with\nregard to the degree of chemical processing, with the models predicting a much\nlower degree of O depletion than observed.

This model contrasts with the much less restrictive\nLOCAL model, where a node may simultaneously communicate with all of its\nneighbors in a single round. A basic question in this setting is how many\nrounds of communication are required for the information dissemination problem,\nin which each node has some piece of information and is required to collect all\nothers. In this paper, we give an algorithm that solves the information\ndissemination problem in at most $O(D+\\text{polylog}{(n)})$ rounds in a network\nof diameter $D$, withno dependence on the conductance.

We also show that\npreviously known no-pumping theorems and some of the fluctuation relations,\nwhen they are applied to cyclic graphs or to one dimensional diffusion, are\nspecial consequences of our duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 02:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Our focus is on allocation\nmechanisms that do not involve any monetary payments. We consider two natural\nmeasures of social welfare: the ordinal welfare factor which measures the\nnumber of agents that are at least as happy as in some unknown, arbitrary\nbenchmark allocation, and the linear welfare factor which assumes an agent's\nutility linearly decreases down his preference lists, and measures the total\nutility to that achieved by an optimal allocation. We analyze two matching\nmechanisms which have been extensively studied by economists. The first\nmechanism is the random serial dictatorship (RSD) where agents are ordered in\naccordance with a randomly chosen permutation, and are successively allocated\ntheir best choice among the unallocated items. The second mechanism is the\nprobabilistic serial (PS) mechanism of Bogomolnaia and Moulin [8], which\ncomputes a fractional allocation that can be expressed as a convex combination\nof integral allocations. The welfare factor of a mechanism is the infimum over\nall instances. For RSD, we show that the ordinal welfare factor is\nasymptotically 1/2, while the linear welfare factor lies in the interval [.526,\n2/3].

In general, the Noether symmetries play an important\nrole in physics because they can be used to simplify a given system of\ndifferential equations as well as to determine the integrability of the system.\nThe Noether symmetries are computed for nine distinct accelerating cosmological\nscenarios that contain a homogeneous scalar field associated with different\ntypes of potentials. We verify that all the scalar field potentials, presented\nhere, admit the trivial first integral namely energy conservation, as they\nshould. We also find that the exponential potential inspired from scalar field\ncosmology, as well as some types of hyperbolic potentials, include extra\nNoether symmetries. This feature suggests that these potentials should be\npreferred along the hierarchy of scalar field potentials. Finally, using the\nlatter potentials, in the framework of either quintessence or phantom scalar\nfield cosmologies that contain also a non-relativistic matter(dark matter)\ncomponent, we find that the main cosmological functions, such as the scale\nfactor of the universe, the scalar field, the Hubble expansion rate and the\nmetric of the FRLW space-time, are computed analytically. Interestingly, under\nspecific circumstances the predictions of the exponential and hyperbolic scalar\nfield models are equivalent to those of the $\\Lambda$CDM model, as far as the\nglobal dynamics and the evolution of the scalar field are concerned. The\npresent analysis suggests that our technique appears to be very competitive to\nother independent tests used to probe the functional form of a given potential\nand thus the associated nature of dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 08:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-19"}

These self sensing force sensors allow a relatively easy upgrade of a\nscanning tunneling microscope to a combined scanning tunneling/atomic force\nmicroscope. Two fundamentally different types of quartz sensors have achieved\natomic resolution: the 'needle sensor' that is based on a length extensional\nresonator and the 'qPlus sensor' that is based on a tuning fork. Here, we\ncalculate and measure the noise characteristics of these sensors. We find four\nnoise sources: deflection detector noise, thermal noise, oscillator noise and\nthermal drift noise. We calculate the effect of these noise sources as a factor\nof sensor stiffness, bandwidth and oscillation amplitude. We find that for self\nsensing quartz sensors, the deflection detector noise is independent of sensor\nstiffness, while the remaining three noise sources increase strongly with\nsensor stiffness. Deflection detector noise increases with bandwidth to the\npower of 1.5, while thermal noise and oscillator noise are proportional to the\nsquare root of the bandwidth. Thermal drift noise, however, is inversely\nproportional to bandwidth. The first three noise sources are inversely\nproportional to amplitude while thermal drift noise is independent of the\namplitude. Thus, we show that the earlier finding that quoted optimal\nsignal-to-noise ratio for oscillation amplitudes similar to the range of the\nforces is still correct when considering all four frequency noise\ncontributions. Finally, we suggest how the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensors\ncan be further improved and briefly discuss the challenges of mounting tips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 08:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 12:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In order to\nreliably control the domain wall motion, it is important to understand how they\ninteract with energy barriers.\n  In this paper, we study the motion and depinning of transverse domain walls\nthrough potential barriers in ferromagnetic cylindrical nanowires. We use\nmagnetic fields and spin-polarized currents to drive the domain walls along the\nwire. Using magnetic fields, we find that the minimum and the maximum fields\nrequired to push the domain wall through the barrier differ by 30 %. On the\ncontrary, using spin-polarized currents, we find variations of a factor 130\nbetween the minimum value of the depinning current density and the maximum\nvalue.\n  We study the depinning current density as a function of the height of the\nenergy barrier using numerical and analytical methods. We find that, for a\nbarrier of 40 k_B T, a depinning current density of about 5 uA is sufficient to\ndepin the domain wall.\n  We reveal and explain the mechanism that leads to these unusually low\ndepinning currents. One requirement for this new depinning mechanism is for the\ndomain wall to be able to rotate around its own axis. With the right barrier\ndesign, the spin torque transfer term is acting exactly against the damping in\nthe micromagnetic system, and thus the low current density is sufficient to\naccumulate enough energy quickly. These key insights may be crucial in\nfurthering the development of novel memory technologies, such as the racetrack\nmemory, that can be controlled through low current densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 10:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Numbers are almost universally represented\nusing position based notations based on exponential powers of a base number -\nusually 10. This representations is computationally efficient for the standard\narithmetic operations, but it is not efficient for factorisation. This has led\nto a common confusion that factorisation is inherently computationally hard. We\npropose a new representation of the natural numbers based on bags and using the\nprime successor function as a primitive - prime bags (PBs). This data structure\nis more efficient for most arithmetic operations, and enables numbers can be\nefficiently factored. However, it also has the interesting feature that\naddition appears to be computationally hard. PBs have an interesting\nalternative interpretation as partitions of numbers represented in the standard\nway, and this reveals a novel relationship between prime numbers and the\npartition function. The PB representation can be extended to rational and\nirrational numbers, and this provides the most direct proof of the\nirrationality of the square root of 2. I argue that what needs to be ultimately\nunderstood is not the peculiar computation complexity properties of the decimal\nsystem (e.g. factorisation), but rather what arithmetical operator trade-offs\nare generally possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 13:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-18"}

The QCD theta term arises from a compactified 5-dimensional Chern-Simons\nterm on the D4 branes. This term couples the QCD topological charge to the\nRamond-Ramond $U(1)$ gauge field of IIA string theory. The nonzero topological\nsusceptibility of pure-glue QCD can be attributed to the presence of D6 branes,\nwhich constitute magnetic sources of the RR gauge field. The topological charge\nof QCD is required, by an anomaly inflow argument, to coincide in space-time\nwith the intersection of the D6 branes and the D4 color branes. This clarifies\nthe relation between D6 branes and the coherent, codimension-one topological\ncharge membranes observed in QCD Monte Carlo calculations. Using\nopen-string/closed-string duality, we interpret a quark loop (represented by a\nD4-D8 open string loop) in terms of closed-string exchange between color and\nflavor branes. The role of the RR gauge field in quark-antiquark annihilation\nprocesses is discussed.

The $(\\log\n{\\rm Det\\;U})^2$ form of the $U(1)$ anomaly emerges naturally.

One nova lying very close to the Galactic plane is V1721\nAquilae, discovered in outburst on 2008 September 22. Spectra obtained 2.69\ndays after outburst revealed very high expansion velocities (FWHM ~6450 km/s).\nIn this paper we have used available pre- and post-outburst photometry and\npost-outburst spectroscopy to conclude that the object is a very fast,\nluminous, and highly extinguished A_V=11.6+/-0.2) nova system with an average\nejection velocity of ~3400 km/s. Pre-outburst near-IR colours from 2MASS\nindicate that at quiescence the object is similar to many quiescent CNe and\nappears to have a main sequence/sub-giant secondary rather than a giant. Based\non the speed of decline of the nova and its emission line profiles we\nhypothesise that the axis ratio of the nova ejecta is ~1.4 and that its\ninclination is such that the central binary accretion disc is face-on to the\nobserver. The accretion disc's blue contribution to the system's near-IR\nquiescent colours may be significant. Simple models of the nova ejecta have\nbeen constructed using the morphological modelling code XS5, and the results\nsupport the above hypothesis. Spectral classification of this object has been\ndifficult owing to low S/N levels and high extinction, which has eliminated all\nevidence of any He/N or FeII emission within the spectra. We suggest two\npossibilities for the nature of V1721 Aql: that it is a U Sco type RN with a\nsub-giant secondary or, less likely, that it is a highly energetic bright and\nfast classical nova with a main sequence secondary. Future monitoring of the\nobject for possible RN episodes may be worthwhile, as would archival searches\nfor previous outbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 14:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

However, with regard to this objective, conventional estimation\nmethods for discrete-time dynamical models are frequently found to be wanting.\nIn fact, they are characteristically misguided in at least two respects: (i)\nassuming that there is a true model; (ii) evaluating the efficacy of the\nestimation as if the postulated model is true. There are numerous examples of\nmodels, when fitted by conventional methods, that fail to capture some of the\nmost basic global features of the data, such as cycles with good matching\nperiods, singularities of spectral density functions (especially at the origin)\nand others. We argue that the shortcomings need not always be due to the model\nformulation but the inadequacy of the conventional fitting methods. After all,\nall models are wrong, but some are useful if they are fitted properly. The\npractical issue becomes one of how to best fit the model to data. Thus, in the\nabsence of a true model, we prefer an alternative approach to conventional\nmodel fitting that typically involves one-step-ahead prediction errors. Our\nprimary aim is to match the joint probability distribution of the observable\ntime series, including long-term features of the dynamics that underpin the\ndata, such as cycles, long memory and others, rather than short-term\nprediction. For want of a better name, we call this specific aim feature\nmatching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 14:37:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 11:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Traditionally, matchings have been used to add edges in order to\nmake a given graph Eulerian, whereas our approach also allows for the removal\nof certain edges leading to a decreased cost.\n  For the TSP on graphic metrics (graph-TSP), the approach yields a\n1.461-approximation algorithm with respect to the Held-Karp lower bound. For\ngraph-TSP restricted to a class of graphs that contains degree three bounded\nand claw-free graphs, we show that the integrality gap of the Held-Karp\nrelaxation matches the conjectured ratio 4/3. The framework allows for\ngeneralizations in a natural way and also leads to a 1.586-approximation\nalgorithm for the traveling salesman path problem on graphic metrics where the\nstart and end vertices are prespecified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 15:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
