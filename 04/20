This form of $\\rho_Z(t)$ follows from\nthe recent proposal that the contribution of zero-point fluctuations of quantum\nfields to the total energy density should be computed by subtracting the\nMinkowski-space result from that computed in the FRW space-time. We discuss\ntheoretical arguments that support this subtraction. By definition, this\neliminates the quartic divergence in the vacuum energy density responsible for\nthe cosmological constant problem.

The first one is to\npropose an extension of the force density method (FDM)(H.J. Schek, 1974), a\nform-finding method for prestressed cable-net structures. The second one is to\npresent a review of various form-finding methods for tension structures, in the\nrelation with the extended FDM. In the first part, it is pointed out that the\noriginal FDM become useless when it is applied to the prestressed structures\nthat consist of combinations of both tension and compression members, while the\nFDM is usually advantageous in form-finding analysis of cable-nets. To\neliminate the limitation, a functional whose stationary problem simply\nrepresents the FDM is firstly proposed. Additionally, the existence of a\nvariational principle in the FDM is also indicated. Then, the FDM is\nextensively redefined by generalizing the formulation of the functional. As the\nresult, the generalized functionals enable us to find the forms of tension\nstructures that consist of combinations of both tension and compression\nmembers, such as tensegrities and suspended membranes with compression struts.\nIn the second part, it is indicated the important role of three expressions\nused by the description of the extended FDM, such as stationary problems of\nfunctionals, the principle of virtual work and stationary conditions using\nNabla symbol. They can be commonly found in general problems of statics,\nwhereas the original FDM only provides a particular form of equilibrium\nequation. Then, to demonstrate the advantage of such expressions, various\nform-finding methods are reviewed and compared.

With the advancement of Smart Grid technologies,\nlarge-scale implementation of variable-rate metering becomes more practical. As\na result, consumers will be able to control their electricity consumption in an\nautomated fashion, where one possible scheme is to have each individual\nmaximize its own utility as a noncooperative game. In this paper,\nnoncooperative games are formulated among the electricity consumers in Smart\nGrid with two real-time pricing schemes, where the Nash equilibrium operation\npoints are investigated for their uniqueness and load balancing properties. The\nfirst pricing scheme charges a price according to the average cost of\nelectricity borne by the retailer and the second one charges according to a\ntime-variant increasing-block price, where for each scheme, a zero-revenue\nmodel and a constant-rate revenue model are considered. In addition, the\nrelationship between the studied games and certain competitive routing games\nfrom the computer networking community, known as atomic flow games, is\nestablished, for which it is shown that the proposed noncooperative game\nformulation falls under the class of atomic splittable flow games. The Nash\nequilibrium is shown to exist for four different combined cases corresponding\nto the two pricing schemes and the two revenue models, and is unique for three\nof the cases under certain conditions. It is further shown that both pricing\nschemes lead to similar electricity loading patterns when consumers are only\ninterested in minimizing the electricity costs without any other profit\nconsiderations. Finally, the conditions under which the increasing-block\npricing scheme is preferred over the average-cost based pricing scheme are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 16:56:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 07:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2011 21:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-14"}

We propose a natural semi-random model, in which a unique game\ninstance is generated in several steps. First an adversary selects a completely\nsatisfiable instance of Unique Games, then she chooses an epsilon-fraction of\nall edges, and finally replaces (\"corrupts\") the constraints corresponding to\nthese edges with new constraints. If all steps are adversarial, the adversary\ncan obtain any (1-epsilon) satisfiable instance, so then the problem is as hard\nas in the worst case. In our semi-random model, one of the steps is random, and\nall other steps are adversarial. We show that known algorithms for unique games\n(in particular, all algorithms that use the standard SDP relaxation) fail to\nsolve semi-random instances of Unique Games.\n  We present an algorithm that with high probability finds a solution\nsatisfying a (1-delta) fraction of all constraints in semi-random instances (we\nrequire that the average degree of the graph is Omega(log k). To this end, we\nconsider a new non-standard SDP program for Unique Games, which is not a\nrelaxation for the problem, and show how to analyze it. We present a new\nrounding scheme that simultaneously uses SDP and LP solutions, which we believe\nis of independent interest.\n  Our result holds only for epsilon less than some absolute constant. We prove\nthat if epsilon > 1/2, then the problem is hard in one of the models, the\nresult assumes the 2-to-2 conjecture.\n  Finally, we study semi-random instances of Unique Games that are at most\n(1-epsilon) satisfiable. We present an algorithm that with high probability,\ndistinguishes between the case when the instance is a semi-random instance and\nthe case when the instance is an (arbitrary) (1-delta) satisfiable instance if\nepsilon > c delta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 17:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}

These quasars were\nidentified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at high redshift (z~2.2); eight are\nradio quiet while two are radio intermediate.

These sources lack\nbroad absorption lines and have blue UV/optical continua, suggesting they are\nintrinsically X-ray weak. However, their average X-ray spectrum appears to be\nharder than those of typical quasars, which may indicate the presence of heavy\nintrinsic X-ray absorption. Our radio-quiet PHL 1811 analogs support a\nconnection between an X-ray weak spectral energy distribution and PHL 1811-like\nUV emission lines; this connection provides an economical way to identify X-ray\nweak type 1 quasars. The fraction of radio-quiet PHL 1811 analogs in the\nradio-quiet quasar population is estimated to be < 1.2%.

In the linear perturbation theory limit, the\nbias-modulation method of McDonald & Seljak allows one to distinguish the\nreal-space galaxy clustering from the peculiar velocity signal in each Fourier\nmode. The ratio of lensing signal to galaxy clustering in transverse modes\nyields the bias factor b of each galaxy subset (as per Pen 2004), hence\ncalibrating the conversion from galaxy real-space density to matter density in\nevery mode. In combination these techniques permit measure of the growth rate f\nin each Fourier mode. This yields a measure of the growth rate free of sample\nvariance, i.e. the uncertainty in f can be reduced without bound by increasing\nthe number of redshifts within a finite volume. In practice, the gain from the\nabsence of sample variance is bounded by the limited range of bias modulation\namong dark-matter halos.

However, we find\nthat despite the higher densities of rock compared to ice, most of the observed\nextrasolar planets with reliable radii measurements have sufficiently large\nRoche radii to support rings. For the currently known transiting extrasolar\nplanets, Poynting-Robertson drag is not effective in significantly altering the\ndynamics of individual ring particles over a time span of $10^8$ years provided\nthat they exceed about 1 m in size. In addition, we show that significantly\nsmaller ring particles can exist in optically thick rings, for which we find\ntypical ring lifetimes ranging from a few times $10^6$ to a few times $10^9$\nyears.

Since penumbral\nstructure and Evershed flow are closely related to photospheric magnetic\ninclination or horizontal field strength, we interpret the rapid changes of\nsunspot structure and surface flow as the result of flare-induced magnetic\nrestructuring down to the photosphere. The magnetic fields turn from fanning\nout to inward connection causing outer penumbrae decay, meanwhile those near\nthe flaring neutral line become more horizontal leading to stronger Evershed\nflow there. The inferred enhancement of horizontal magnetic field near the\nneutral line is consistent with recent magnetic observations and theoretical\npredictions of flare-invoked photospheric magnetic field change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 23:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The turbulence and structure of GMCs in\nM33 are comparable to those found in other systems, so the differences are\nunlikely to result from different GMC properties. Since lower CO-to-HCN ratios\nare associated with the highest rates of star formation, we attribute the\ndeficits in part to evolutionary effects within GMCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 04:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We\nderive a numerically exact expression for the particle current and examine its\ncharacteristics as it evolves in time from the transient regime to the\nlong-time steady-state regime. We find that just after switch-on the current\ninitially overshoots the expected long-time steady-state value, oscillates and\ndecays as a power law, and eventually settles to a steady-state value\nconsistent with the value calculated using the Landauer formula. The power-law\nparameters depend on the values of the applied bias voltage, the strength of\nthe couplings, and the speed of the switch-on. In particular, the oscillating\ntransient current decays away longer for lower bias voltages. Furthermore, the\npower-law decay nature of the current suggests an equivalent series\nresistor-inductor-capacitor circuit wherein all of the components have\ntime-dependent properties. Such dynamical resistive, inductive, and capacitive\ninfluences are generic in nano-circuites where dynamical switches are\nincorporated. We also examine the characteristics of the dynamical current in a\nnano-oscillator modeled by introducing a sinusoidally modulated interleads\ncoupling between the two leads. We find that the current does not strictly\nfollow the sinusoidal form of the coupling. In particular, the maximum current\ndoes not occur during times when the leads are exactly aligned. Instead, the\ntimes when the maximum current occurs depend on the values of the bias\npotential, nearest-neighbor coupling, and the interleads coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 09:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 10:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Recent work has shown\nthat a planetesimal swarm embedded in a fully turbulent disc is subject to\nstrong excitation of the velocity dispersion, leading to collisional\ndestruction of bodies with radii R_p < 100 km. Significant diffusion of\nplanetesimal semimajor axes also arises, leading to large-scale spreading of\nthe planetesimal population throughout the inner regions of the protoplanetary\ndisc, in apparent contradiction of constraints provided by the distribution of\nasteroids within the asteroid belt. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of\nplanetesimals embedded in vertically stratified turbulent discs, with and\nwithout dead zones. Our main aims are to examine the turbulent excitation of\nthe velocity dispersion, and the radial diffusion, of planetesimals in these\ndiscs. We employ three dimensional MHD simulations [...], along with an\nequilibrium chemistry model [...] We find that planetesimals in fully turbulent\ndiscs develop large random velocities that will lead to collisional\ndestruction/erosion for bodies with sizes below 100 km, and undergo radial\ndiffusion on a scale \\sim 2.5 au over a 5 Myr disc life time. But planetesimals\nin a dead zone experience a much reduced excitation of their random velocities,\nand equilibrium velocity dispersions lie between the disruption thresholds for\nweak and strong aggregates for sizes R_p < 100 km. We also find that radial\ndiffusion occurs over a much reduced length scale \\sim 0.25 au over the disc\nlife time, this being consistent with solar system constraints. We conclude\nthat planetesimal growth via mutual collisions between smaller bodies cannot\noccur in a fully turbulent disc. By contrast, a dead zone may provide a safe\nhaven in which km-sized planetesimals can avoid mutual destruction through\ncollisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 10:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 14:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-23"}

The relationship between proxies and\ntemperature is weak and the number of proxies is far larger than the number of\ntarget data points. Furthermore, the data contain complex spatial and temporal\ndependence structures which are not easily captured with simple models. In this\npaper, we assess the reliability of such reconstructions and their statistical\nsignificance against various null models. We find that the proxies do not\npredict temperature significantly better than random series generated\nindependently of temperature. Furthermore, various model specifications that\nperform similarly at predicting temperature produce extremely different\nhistorical backcasts. Finally, the proxies seem unable to forecast the high\nlevels of and sharp run-up in temperature in the 1990s either in-sample or from\ncontiguous holdout blocks, thus casting doubt on their ability to predict such\nphenomena if in fact they occurred several hundred years ago.

The\nnumber of multi-opposition asteroids found is 274 for J2/1, 1197 for J3/2 and 3\nfor J4/3. Using both hierarchical clustering technique and colour\nidentification we characterise a collisionally-born asteroid family around the\nobject (1911) Schubart in the J3/2 resonance. There is also a looser cluster\naround the largest asteroid (153) Hilda. Using N-body numerical simulations we\nprove that the Yarkovsky effect (infrared thermal emission from the surface of\nasteroids) causes a systematic drift in eccentricity for resonant asteroids,\nwhile their semimajor axis is almost fixed due to the strong coupling with\nJupiter. This is a different mechanism from main belt families, where the\nYarkovsky drift affects basically the semimajor axis. We use the eccentricity\nevolution to determine the following ages: (1.7+-0.7) Gyr for the Schubart\nfamily and >~4 Gyr for the Hilda family. We also find that collisionally-born\nclusters in the J2/1 resonance would efficiently dynamically disperse. The\nsteep size distribution of the stable population inside this resonance could\nthus make sense if most of these bodies are fragments from an event older than\n~1 Gyr.

Charged products were measured by means of the\n$4\\pi$ INDRA array. Kinetic-energy spectra and angular distributions of\nfragments with atomic number 3 $\\le Z \\le$ 28 indicate a high degree of\nrelaxation and are compatible with a fission-like phenomenon. Persistence of\nstructure effects is evidenced from elemental cross-sections ($\\sigma_{Z}$) as\nwell as a strong odd-even-staggering (o-e-s) of the light-fragment yields. The\nmagnitude of the staggering does not significantly depend on the neutron\ncontent of the emitting system. Fragment-particle coincidences suggest that the\nlight partners in very asymmetric fission are emitted either cold or at\nexcitation energies below the particle emission thresholds. The evaporation\nresidue cross-section of the $^{78}$Kr + $^{40}$Ca reaction is slightly higher\nthan the one measured in $^{82}$Kr + $^{40}$Ca reaction. The fission-like\ncomponent is larger by $\\sim$ 25% for the reaction having the lowest\nneutron-to-proton ratio. These experimental features are confronted to the\npredictions of theoretical models. The Hauser-Feshbach approach including the\nemission of fragments up to $Z$ = 14 in their ground states as well as excited\nstates does not account for the main features of $\\sigma_{Z}$. For both\nreactions, the transition-state formalism reasonably reproduces the\n$Z$-distribution of the fragments with charge 12 $\\le Z \\le$ 28.

We\nrefer to such a relay as a MIMO switch. With beamforming and linear detection,\nthe MIMO switch controls which stations are connected to which stations. Each\nbeamforming matrix realizes a permutation pattern among the stations. We refer\nto the corresponding permutation matrix as a switch matrix.

In this paper, we focus on \"fair switching\" in which equal amounts\nof traffic are to be delivered for all $N(N-1)$ ordered pairs of stations.

Radio polarimetry gives the degree of order of magnetic\nfields, and the orientation of the ordered component. Many young shell\nsupernova remnants show evidence for synchrotron X-ray emission. The spatial\nanalysis of this emission suggests that magnetic fields are amplified by one to\ntwo orders of magnitude in strong shocks. Detection of several remnants in TeV\ngamma rays implies a lower limit on the magnetic-field strength (or a\nmeasurement, if the emission process is inverse-Compton upscattering of cosmic\nmicrowave background photons). Upper limits to GeV emission similarly provide\nlower limits on magnetic-field strengths. In the historical shell remnants,\nlower limits on B range from 25 to 1000 microGauss. Two remnants show\nvariability of synchrotron X-ray emission with a timescale of years. If this\ntimescale is the electron-acceleration or radiative loss timescale, magnetic\nfields of order 1 mG are also implied. In pulsar-wind nebulae, equipartition\narguments and dynamical modeling can be used to infer magnetic-field strengths\nanywhere from about 5 microGauss to 1 mG. Polarized fractions are considerably\nhigher than in SNRs, ranging to 50 or 60% in some cases; magnetic-field\ngeometries often suggest a toroidal structure around the pulsar, but this is\nnot universal. Viewing-angle effects undoubtedly play a role. MHD models of\nradio emission in shell SNRs show that different orientations of upstream\nmagnetic field, and different assumptions about electron acceleration, predict\ndifferent radio morphology. In the remnant of SN 1006, such comparisons imply a\nmagnetic-field orientation connecting the bright limbs, with a non-negligible\ngradient of its strength across the remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 14:49:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 21:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The maximum matching problem in the semi-streaming model\nhas received a significant amount of attention lately. While the problem has\nbeen somewhat well solved for bipartite graphs, the known algorithms for\nnon-bipartite graphs use $2^{\\frac1\\epsilon}$ passes or $n^{\\frac1\\epsilon}$\ntime to compute a $(1-\\epsilon)$ approximation. In this paper we provide the\nfirst FPTAS (polynomial in $n,\\frac1\\epsilon$) for the problem which is\nefficient in both the running time and the number of passes. We also show that\nwe can estimate the size of the matching in $O(\\frac1\\epsilon)$ passes using\nslightly superlinear space.\n  To achieve both results, we use the structural properties of the matching\npolytope such as the laminarity of the tight sets and total dual integrality.\nThe algorithms are iterative, and are based on the fractional packing and\ncovering framework. However the formulations herein require exponentially many\nvariables or constraints. We use laminarity, metric embeddings and graph\nsparsification to reduce the space required by the algorithms in between and\nacross the iterations. This is the first use of these ideas in the\nsemi-streaming model to solve a combinatorial optimization problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 15:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

These\neffective interactions however have a specific current-current-like structure\nand can be interpreted from an M-theory viewpoint as coming from the exchange\nof heavy vector multiplets. One may then attempt to inhibit the emergence of\ngeneric soft scalar masses in the visible sector by postulating a suitable\nglobal symmetry in the dynamics of the hidden sector. This mechanism is however\nnot straightforward to implement, because the structure of the effective\ncontact terms and the possible global symmetries is a priori model dependent.\nTo assess whether there is any robust and generic option, we study the full\ndependence of the Kahler potential on the moduli and the matter fields. This is\nwell known for orbifold models, where it always leads to a symmetric scalar\nmanifold, but much less understood for Calabi-Yau models, where it generically\nleads to a non-symmetric scalar manifold. We then examine the possibility of an\neffective sequestering by global symmetries, and argue that whereas for\norbifold models this can be put at work rather naturally, for Calabi-Yau models\nit can only be implemented in rather peculiar circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 15:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-13"}
