Researchers have long investigated how to take\nadvantage of dataflow constraints by embedding them into procedural languages.\nPrevious mixed imperative/dataflow systems, however, require syntactic\nextensions or libraries of ad hoc data types for binding the imperative program\nto the dataflow solver. In this paper we propose a novel approach that smoothly\ncombines the two paradigms without placing undue burden on the programmer. In\nour framework, programmers can define ordinary commands of the host imperative\nlanguage that enforce constraints between objects stored in \"reactive\" memory\nlocations. Reactive objects can be of any legal type in the host language,\nincluding primitive data types, pointers, arrays, and structures. Constraints\nare automatically re-executed every time their input memory locations change,\nletting a program behave like a spreadsheet where the values of some variables\ndepend upon the values of other variables. The constraint solving mechanism is\nhandled transparently by altering the semantics of elementary operations of the\nhost language for reading and modifying objects. We provide a formal semantics\nand describe a concrete embodiment of our technique into C/C++, showing how to\nimplement it efficiently in conventional platforms using off-the-shelf\ncompilers. We discuss relevant applications to reactive scenarios, including\nincremental computation, observer design pattern, and data structure repair.\nThe performance of our implementation is compared to ad hoc problem-specific\nchange propagation algorithms and to language-centric approaches such as\nself-adjusting computation and subject/observer communication mechanisms,\nshowing that the proposed approach is efficient in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 18:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-13"}

We use two methods to derive\ndensities from the UVCS measurements, including a density sensitive O V line\nratio at 1213.85 and 1218.35 Angstroms, and radiative pumping of the O VI\n1032,1038 doublet by chromospheric emission lines. The most strongly\nconstrained feature shows cumulative plasma heating comparable to or greater\nthan the kinetic energy, while features observed earlier during the event show\ncumulative plasma heating of order or less than the kinetic energy. SOHO\nMichelson Doppler Imager (MDI) observations are used to estimate the active\nregion magnetic energy. We consider candidate plasma heating mechanisms and\nprovide constraints when possible. Because this CME was associated with a\nrelatively weak flare, the contribution by flare energy (e.g., through thermal\nconduction or energetic particles) is probably small; however, the flare may\nhave been partially behind the limb. Wave heating by photospheric motions\nrequires heating rates significantly larger than those previously inferred for\ncoronal holes, but the eruption itself could drive waves which heat the plasma.\nHeating by small-scale reconnection in the flux rope or by the CME current\nsheet is not significantly constrained.

The single-dish CO profile\nexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested Gaussian fit to be\nproperly described. Interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-\nconcentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 Msuns and a molecular\noutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 Msuns. The molecular gas close to the\nsystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about\n4.1x108 Msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. This compact molecular\nnucleus has a surface density of \\approx 2.7 \\times 10^4 Msuns/pc^2, more than\ntwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the disk\nof the Milky Way, and it appears to sit on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation\ndespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. We interpret this\nnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. A mass outflow rate of 13\nMsuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 Myr. The star formation in\nNGC 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven by\nthe active galactic nucleus (AGN). The concentration of the majority of the\nmolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angular\nmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enable\nthe transfer. NGC 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that does\nnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The Gaia satellite will measure highly accurate absolute parallaxes\nof hundreds of millions of stars by comparing the parallactic displacements in\nthe two fields of view of the optical instrument. The requirements on the\nstability of the 'basic angle' between the two fields are correspondingly\nstrict, and possible variations (on the microarcsec level) are therefore\nmonitored by an on-board metrology system. Nevertheless, since even very small\nperiodic variations of the basic angle might cause a global offset of the\nmeasured parallaxes, it is important to find independent verification methods.\nAims. We investigate the potential use of Galactic Cepheids as standard candles\nfor verifying the Gaia parallax zero point. Methods. We simulate the complete\npopulation of Galactic Cepheids and their observations by Gaia. Using the\nsimulated data, simultaneous fits are made of the parameters of the\nperiod-luminosity relation and a global parallax zero point. Results. The total\nnumber of Galactic Cepheids is estimated at about 20 000, of which nearly half\ncould be observed by Gaia. In the most favourable circumstances, including\nnegligible intrinsic scatter and extinction errors, the determined parallax\nzero point has an uncertainty of 0.2 microarcsec. With more realistic\nassumptions the uncertainty is several times larger, and the result is very\nsensitive to errors in the applied extinction corrections. Conclusions. The use\nof Galactic Cepheids alone will not be sufficient to determine a possible\nparallax zero-point error to the full potential systematic accuracy of Gaia.\nThe global verification of Gaia parallaxes will most likely depend on a\ncombination of many different methods, including this one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 22:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Hence it\nis required that at each time instance a set of non-interfering nodes\n(corresponding to an independent set in G) access the wireless medium. To\nutilize wireless resources efficiently, it is required to arbitrate the access\nof medium among interfering nodes properly. Moreover, to be of practical use,\nsuch a mechanism is required to be totally distributed as well as simple. As\nthe main result of this paper, we provide such a medium access algorithm. It is\nrandomized, totally distributed and simple: each node attempts to access medium\nat each time with probability that is a function of its local information. We\nestablish efficiency of the algorithm by showing that the corresponding network\nMarkov chain is positive recurrent as long as the demand imposed on the network\ncan be supported by the wireless network (using any algorithm).

Simulations were\nperformed with instantaneously accelerated and radiatively driven stellar\nwinds. Radiative transfer calculations were performed on the simulation output\nto generate synthetic X-ray data, which are used to conduct a detailed\ncomparison against observations. When instantaneously accelerated stellar winds\nare adopted in the simulation, a stable wind-wind collision region (WCR) is\nestablished at all orbital phases. In contrast, when the stellar winds are\nradiatively driven, and thus the acceleration regions of the winds are\naccounted for, the WCR is far more unstable. As the stars approach periastron,\nthe ram pressure of the WR's wind overwhelms the O star's and, following a\nsignificant disruption of the shocks by non-linear thin-shell instabilities\n(NTSIs), the WCR collapses onto the O star. X-ray calculations reveal that when\na stable WCR exists the models over-predict the observed X-ray flux by more\nthan two orders of magnitude. The collapse of the WCR onto the O star\nsubstantially reduces the discrepancy in the $2-10\\;$keV flux to a factor of\n$\\simeq 6$ at $\\phi=0.994$. However, the observed spectrum is not well matched\nby the models. We conclude that the agreement between the models and\nobservations could be improved by increasing the ratio of the mass-loss rates\nin favour of the WR star to the extent that a normal wind ram pressure balance\ndoes not occur at any orbital phase, potentially leading to a sustained\ncollapse of the WCR onto the O star. Radiative braking may then play a\nsignificant r\\^{o}le for the WCR dynamics and resulting X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 05:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Attempts to use the emission of optical Cherenkov radiation from showers\nas a basis for TeV gamma-ray astronomy proved difficult and problematical,\ngiven the rather primitive light-collecting systems in use at the time, coupled\nwith a practical inability to reject the overwhelming background arising from\nhadronic showers. Simultaneously, a number of groups experimented with passive\ndetection of radio emission from EAS as a possible cheap, simple, stand-alone\nmethod to detect and characterise showers of energy greater than 10^16 eV. By\nthe end of the decade, it was shown that the radio emission was quite highly\nbeamed and hence the effective collection area for detection of high energy\nshowers was quite limited, diminishing the effectiveness of the radio signature\nas a stand-alone shower detection channel.

One process to\nalter the inclination of a planet is through planet-disc interactions. Recent\nsimulations considering radiative transport have shown that the evolution of\nmigration and eccentricity can strongly depend on the thermodynamic state of\nthe disc. We extend previous studies to investigate the planet-disc\ninteractions of fixed and moving planets on inclined and eccentric orbits. We\nalso analyse the effect of the disc's thermodynamic properties on the orbital\nevolution of embedded planets in detail. The protoplanetary disc is modelled as\na viscous gas where the internally produced dissipation is transported by\nradiation. For locally isothermal discs, we confirm previous results and find\ninclination damping and inward migration for planetary cores. For low\ninclinations i < 2 H/r, the damping is exponential, while di/dt is proportional\nto i^-2 for larger i. For radiative discs, the planetary migration is very\nlimited, as long as their inclination exceeds a certain threshold. If the\ninclination is damped below this threshold, planetary cores with a mass up to\napproximately 33 Earth masses start to migrate outwards, while larger cores\nmigrate inwards right from the start. The inclination is damped for all\nanalysed planet masses. In a viscous disc an initial inclination of embedded\nplanets will be damped for all planet masses. This damping occurs on timescales\nthat are shorter than the migration time. If the inclination lies beneath a\ncertain threshold, the outward migration in radiative discs is not handicapped.\nOutward migration is strongest for circular and non-inclined orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 08:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

The traditional diffusion approach of the\nSmoluchowski theory for coagulation of colloids is critically analyzed and\nshown to be valid only in the particular case of coalescence of small particles\nwith large ones. It is shown that, owing to rapid diffusion mixing, coalescence\nof comparable size particles occurs in the kinetic regime, realized under\ncondition of homogeneous spatial distribution of particles, in the two modes,\ncontinuum and free molecular. Transition from the continuum to the free\nmolecular mode can be described by the interpolation expression derived within\nthe new analytical approach with fitting parameters that can be specified\nnumerically, avoiding semi-empirical assumptions of the traditional models. A\nsimilar restriction arises in the traditional approach to the diffusion-limited\nreaction rate theory, based on generalization of the Smoluchowski theory for\ncoagulation of colloids. In particular, it is shown that the traditional\napproach is applicable only to the special case of reactions with a large\nreaction radius, and becomes inappropriate to calculation of the reaction rate\nin the case of a relatively small reaction radius. In the latter, more general\ncase particles collisions occur mainly in the kinetic regime (rather than in\nthe diffusion one) characterized by homogeneous (at random) spatial\ndistribution of particles. The calculated reaction rate for a small reaction\nradius in 3-d formally coincides with the expression derived in the traditional\napproach for reactions with a large reaction radius, however, notably deviates\nat large times from the traditional result in the plane (2-d) geometry, that\nhas wide applications also in the membrane biology as well as in some other\nimportant areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 08:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 09:25:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2011 07:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 09:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 16:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

We consider in particular the\ncase of PSU(2,2|4)/Sp(2,2)xSp(4) which corresponds to AdS(5)xS(5). We argue\nthat the infinite tower of conserved charges of these theories includes an\nexotic N=(8,8) supersymmetry that is realized in a mildy non-local way at the\nLagrangian level. The supersymmetry is associated to a double central extension\nof the superalgebra psu(2|2)+psu(2|2) and includes a non-trivial R symmetry\nalgebra corresponding to global gauge transformations, as well as 2-dimensional\nspacetime translations. We then explicitly construct soliton solutions and show\nthat they carry an internal moduli superspace CP(2|1)xCP(2|1) with both bosonic\nand Grassmann collective coordinates. We show how to semi-classical quantize\nthe solitons by writing an effective quantum mechanical system on the moduli\nspace which takes the form of a co-adjoint orbit of SU(2|2)xSU(2|2).

The underlying\nphysical prescriptions inherent to each SAM are, in many cases, different from\none another. Several SAMs have been applied to the dark matter merger trees\nextracted from the Millennium Run, including those associated with the\nwell-known Munich and Durham lineages. We compare the predicted luminosity\ndistributions of galaxy groups using four publicly available SAMs (De Lucia et\nal. 2006; Bower et al. 2006; Bertone et al. 2007; Font et al. 2008), in order\nto explore a galactic environment in which the models have not been explored to\nthe same degree as they have in the field or in rich clusters. We identify a\ncharacteristic \"wiggle\" in the group galaxy luminosity function generated using\nthe De Lucia et al.

However, a comparison between\nconditional luminosity functions of groups between the models and observations\nof Yang et al.

An associated analysis of the magnitude\ngap distribution between first- and second-ranked group galaxies shows that\nwhile the Durham models yield distributions with approximately equal luminosity\nfirst- and second-ranked galaxies, in agreement with observations, the De Lucia\net al. models favours the scenario in which the second-ranked galaxy is\napproximately one magnitude fainter than the primary,especially when the\ndynamic range of the mock data is limited to 3 magnitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 11:15:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 11:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In the ansatz, a contraction mapping plays the role of dissipation.\nIn the limit of maximal dissipation, which corresponds to the attractive fixed\npoint of the contraction mapping, the gauge fields reduce, up to constant\nfactors, to the Pauli quantum gates for one-qubit states. Then tubuline-qubits\ncan be processed in the quantum vacuum of the classical field theory of the\nbrain, where decoherence is avoided due to the extremely low temperature.\nFinally, we interpret the classical SU(2) dissipative gauge theory as the\nquantum metalanguage (relative to the quantum logic of qubits), which holds the\nnon-algorithmic aspect of the mind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 12:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-14"}

Our approach combines tools from\ntopological graph theory and analytic combinatorics. In particular, we\nintroduce a new type of branch decomposition called \"surface cut\ndecomposition\", generalizing sphere cut decompositions of planar graphs\nintroduced by Seymour and Thomas, which has nice combinatorial properties.\nNamely, the number of partial solutions that can be arranged on a surface cut\ndecomposition can be upper-bounded by the number of non-crossing partitions on\nsurfaces with boundary. It follows that partial solutions can be represented by\na single-exponential (in the branchwidth k) number of configurations. This\nproves that, when applied on surface cut decompositions, dynamic programming\nruns in 2^{O(k)} n steps. That way, we considerably extend the class of\nproblems that can be solved in running times with a single-exponential\ndependence on branchwidth and unify/improve most previous results in this\ndirection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 13:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 09:41:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 20:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 16:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Here, we present the evidence that traces of past occurrences of\nthis kind of phenomena can be found in normal but once active galaxies. Based\non the properties of a few such \"post-active\" galaxies that are representative\nfor a much wider group, it has been argued that they have reached the\nevolutionary stages when their nuclei, which were radio-loud in the past, now,\nmimicking the behaviour of XRBs, remain in the intermediate state on their way\ntowards quiescence or even have already entered the quiescent state. It follows\nthat the full evolutionary track of XRBs can be mapped onto the evolution of\ngalaxies. The above findings are in line with those reported recently for IC\n2497, a galaxy that 70,000 years ago or less hosted a quasar but now appears as\na normal one. This scenario stems from the presence of Hanny's Voorwerp, a\nnebulous object in its vicinity excited by that QSO in the epoch when IC 2497\nwas active. The post-active galaxies we deal with here are accompanied by\nextremely weak and diffuse relic radio lobes that were inflated during their\nformer active period.

The leafage is a polynomially computable\nparameter by the result of \\cite{esa}. In this contribution, we study the\nvertex leafage.\n  We prove for every fixed $k\\geq 3$ that deciding whether the vertex leafage\nof a given chordal graph is at most $k$ is NP-complete by proving a stronger\nresult, namely that the problem is NP-complete on split graphs with vertex\nleafage of at most $k+1$. On the other hand, for chordal graphs of leafage at\nmost $\\ell$, we show that the vertex leafage can be calculated in time\n$n^{O(\\ell)}$. Finally, we prove that there exists a tree model that realizes\nboth the leafage and the vertex leafage of $G$. Notably, for every path graph\n$G$, there exists a path model with $\\ell(G)$ leaves in the host tree and it\ncan be computed in $O(n^3)$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 15:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2012 22:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

A generalized\nvon-Neumann-Wigner theorem we propose here gives the number of constraints on\nthe lattice necessary to have contacts without fine tuning of lattice\nparameters. By counting this number, one could quest for the candidate of Dirac\nsystems without solving the secular equation. The constraints can be provided\nby any kinds of symmetry present in the system. The theory also enables the\nanalytical determination of k-point having accidental contact by selectively\npicking up only the degenerate solution of the secular equation. By using these\nframeworks, we demonstrate that the Dirac points are feasible in various\ntwo-dimensional lattices, e.g. the anisotropic Kagome lattice under inversion\nsymmetry is found to have contacts over the whole lattice parameter space.\nSpin-dependent cases, such as the spin-density-wave state in LaOFeAs with\nreflection symmetry, are also dealt with in the present scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 15:10:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 08:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In this model an\nadversary adaptively chooses a new network topology in every round, making even\nbasic distributed computations challenging.\n  Kuhn et al. show that n nodes, each starting with a d-bit token, can\nbroadcast them to all nodes in time O(n^2) using b-bit messages, where b > d +\nlog n. Their algorithms take the natural approach of {token forwarding}: in\nevery round each node broadcasts some particular token it knows. They prove\nmatching Omega(n^2) lower bounds for a natural class of token forwarding\nalgorithms and an Omega(n log n) lower bound that applies to all\ntoken-forwarding algorithms.\n  We use network coding, transmitting random linear combinations of tokens, to\nbreak both lower bounds. Our algorithm's performance is quadratic in the\nmessage size b, broadcasting the n tokens in roughly d/b^2 * n^2 rounds. For b\n= d = O(log n) our algorithms use O(n^2/log n) rounds, breaking the first lower\nbound, while for larger message sizes we obtain linear-time algorithms. We also\nconsider networks that change only every T rounds, and achieve an additional\nfactor T^2 speedup. This contrasts with related lower and upper bounds of Kuhn\net al. implying that for natural token-forwarding algorithms a speedup of T,\nbut not more, can be obtained. Lastly, we give a general way to derandomize\nrandom linear network coding, that also leads to new deterministic information\ndissemination algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 15:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-14"}
