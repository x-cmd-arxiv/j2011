In a network-aware context, one can\n(and should) exploit the social links, which can indicate how users relate to\nthe seeker and how much weight their tagging actions should have in the result\nbuild-up. We propose an algorithm that has the potential to scale to current\napplications. While the problem has already been considered in previous\nliterature, this was done either under strong simplifying assumptions or under\nchoices that cannot scale to even moderate-size real world applications. We\nfirst consider a key aspect of the problem, which is accessing the closest or\nmost relevant users for a given seeker. We describe how this can be done on the\nfly (without any pre-computations) for several possible choices - arguably the\nmost natural ones - of proximity computation in a user network. Based on this,\nour top-k algorithm is sound and complete, while addressing the scalability\nissues of the existing ones. Importantly, our technique is instance optimal in\nthe case when the search relies exclusively on the social weight of tagging\nactions. To further reduce response times, we then consider directions for\nefficiency by approximation. Extensive experiments on real world data show that\nour techniques can drastically improve the response time, without sacrificing\nprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2011 16:33:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 13:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 16:07:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 10:10:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 20:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 15:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-08"}

It is demonstrated that the total\nmean-field diffusivity for passive scalar transport in a compressible flow may\nwell be smaller than the molecular diffusivity. This is in full analogy to an\nold finding regarding the magnetic mean-field diffusivity in an electrically\nconducting turbulently moving compressible fluid. These phenomena occur if the\nirrotational part of the motion dominates the vortical part, the P\\`eclet or\nmagnetic Reynolds number is not too large, and, in addition, the variation of\nthe flow pattern is slow. For both the passive scalar and the magnetic cases\nseveral further analytical results on mean-field diffusivities and related\nquantities found within the second-order correlation approximation are\npresented, as well as numerical results obtained by the test-field method,\nwhich applies independently of this approximation. Particular attention is paid\nto non-local and non-instantaneous connections between the turbulence-caused\nterms and the mean fields. Two examples of irrotational flows, in which\ninteresting phenomena in the above sense occur, are investigated in detail. In\nparticular, it is demonstrated that the decay of a mean scalar in a\ncompressible fluid under the influence of these flows can be much slower than\nwithout any flow, and can be strongly influenced by the so-called memory\neffect, that is, the fact that the relevant mean-field coefficients depend on\nthe decay rates themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2011 17:20:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 11:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In the common rest frame of the ion and\nthe electron beam the ion is subjected to a drag force and it experiences a\nloss or a gain of energy which eventually reduces the energy spread of the ion\nbeam. A calculation of this process is complicated as the electron velocity\ndistribution is anisotropic and the cooling process takes place in a magnetic\nfield which guides the electrons. In this paper the cooling force is calculated\nin a model of binary collisions (BC) between ions and magnetized electrons, in\nwhich the Coulomb interaction is treated up to second-order as a perturbation\nto the helical motion of the electrons. The calculations are done with the help\nof an improved BC theory which is uniformly valid for any strength of the\nmagnetic field and where the second-order two-body forces are treated in the\ninteraction in Fourier space without specifying the interaction potential. The\ncooling force is explicitly calculated for a regularized and screened potential\nwhich is both of finite range and less singular than the Coulomb interaction at\nthe origin. Closed expressions are derived for monochromatic electron beams,\nwhich are folded with the velocity distributions of the electrons and ions. The\nresulting cooling force is evaluated for anisotropic Maxwell velocity\ndistributions of the electrons and ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2011 06:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 07:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-05"}

This scheme was developed in the context of the Adaptive Mesh\nRefinement (AMR) schemes based on a graded-octree data structure. The Poisson\nequation is solved on a level-by-level basis, using a \"one-way interface\"\nscheme in which boundary conditions are interpolated from the previous coarser\nlevel solution. Such a scheme is particularly well suited for self-gravitating\nastrophysical flows requiring an adaptive time stepping strategy. By\nconstructing a multigrid hierarchy covering the active cells of each AMR level,\nwe have designed a memory-efficient algorithm that can benefit fully from the\nmultigrid acceleration. We present a simple method for capturing the boundary\nconditions across the multigrid hierarchy, based on a second-order accurate\nreconstruction of the boundaries of the multigrid levels. In case of very\ncomplex boundaries, small scale features become smaller than the discretization\ncell size of coarse multigrid levels and convergence problems arise. We propose\na simple solution to address these issues. Using our scheme, the convergence\nrate usually depends on the grid size for complex grids, but good linear\nconvergence is maintained. The proposed method was successfully implemented on\ndistributed memory architectures in the RAMSES code, for which we present and\ndiscuss convergence and accuracy properties as well as timing performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2011 12:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-16"}

During the observations, the source did not exhibit Z-track movement,\nbut remained in the vicinity of the soft apex. It was in a radio\nquiescent/quiet state of < 150 microJy. Strong dip events were seen as 25%\nreductions in X-ray intensity. The use of broadband CCD spectra in combination\nwith narrow-band grating spectra has now demonstrated for the first time that\nthese dipping events in Cygnus X-2 are caused by absorption in cool material in\nquite a unique way. In the band 0.2 - 10 keV, dipping appears to be due to\nprogressive covering of the Comptonized emission of an extended accretion disk\ncorona, the covering factor rising to 40% in deep dipping with an associated\ncolumn density of 3.10^{23} atom cm^{-2}.
