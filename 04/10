As has been well-known,\nsupersymmetric (SUSY) models can generate the $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$ decay rate\nwithin the search reach of the MEG experiment. A certain class of SUSY grand\nunified theory (GUT) models such as the minimal SUSY SO(10) model (we call this\nclass of models \"predictive SO(10) models\") can unambiguously determine fermion\nYukawa coupling matrices, in particular, the neutrino Dirac Yukawa matrix.\nBased on the universal boundary conditions for soft SUSY breaking parameters at\nthe GUT scale, we calculate the rate of the $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$ process by using\nthe completely determined Dirac Yukawa matrix in two examples of predictive\nSO(10) models. If we interpret the 3 events in MEG experiment as a positive\nsignal and combine it with other experimental constraints such as the relic\ndensity of the neutralino dark matter and recent results on muon $g-2$, we can\npin down a parameter set of the universal boundary conditions. Then, we propose\nbenchmark sparticle mass spectra for each predictive SO(10) model, which will\nbe tested at the Large Hadronic Collider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2011 19:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-12"}

They are also the\nonly known pointwise consistent methods for coupling a general atomistic model\nto a finite element continuum model. However, the development of efficient and\nreliable iterative solution methods for the force-based approximation presents\na challenge due to the non-symmetric and indefinite structure of the linearized\nforce-based quasicontinuum approximation, as well as to its unusual stability\nproperties. In this paper, we present rigorous numerical analysis and\ncomputational experiments to systematically study the stability and convergence\nrate for a variety of linear stationary iterative methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2011 14:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-12"}

Thermal equilibrium is however not achievable at low temperatures\nin glassy systems. Such systems are characterized by a multitude of metastable\nconfigurations, pictorially referred to as `valleys' of an energy landscape.\nGeometrical properties of the landscape, e.g. the local density of states\ndescribing the distribution in energy of the states belonging to a single\nvalley, are key to understand the dynamical properties of such systems. In this\npaper we combine the lid algorithm, a tool for landscape exploration previously\napplied to a range of models, with the Wang-Swendsen algorithm. To test this\nimproved exploration tool, we consider a paradigmatic complex system, the\nEdwards-Andersom model in two and three spatial dimension. We find a striking\ndifference between the energy dependence of the local density of states in the\ntwo cases: nearly flat in the first case, and nearly exponential in the second.\nThe lid dependence of the data is analyzed to estimate the form of the global\ndensity of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2011 15:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2011 12:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}
