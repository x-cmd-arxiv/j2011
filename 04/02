These algorithms are particularly interesting due to their\nlow complexity (linear in the signal dimension $n$). The asymptotic analysis\npredicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration $\\ell$ in\nthe asymptotic regime where $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. The analysis is similar in\nnature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze\niterative decoding algorithms. To perform the analysis, a message-passing\ninterpretation of NB-VB algorithms is provided. This interpretation lacks the\nextrinsic nature of standard message-passing algorithms to which density\nevolution is usually applied. This requires a number of non-trivial\nmodifications in the analysis. The analysis tracks the average performance of\nthe recovery algorithms over the ensembles of input signals and sensing\nmatrices as a function of $\\ell$. Concentration results are devised to\ndemonstrate that the performance of the recovery algorithms applied to any\nchoice of the input signal over any realization of the sensing matrix follows\nthe deterministic results of the analysis closely.

Our context is a highly\ndetailed phenomenological probe of No-Scale F-SU(5), a model representing the\nintersection of the F-lipped SU(5) X U(1)_X Grand Unified Theory (GUT) with\nextra TeV-Scale vector-like multiplets derived out of F-theory, and the\ndynamics of No-Scale Supergravity.

In order to acheive this goal, it is important to carefully design\nthe learner, so it will not overfit the training data. The later can is done\nusually by adding a regularization term. The statistical learning theory\nexplains the success of this method by claiming that it restricts the\ncomplexity of the learned model. This explanation, however, is rather abstract\nand does not have a geometric intuition. The generalization error of a\nclassifier may be thought of as correlated with its robustness to perturbations\nof the data: a classifier that copes with disturbance is expected to generalize\nwell. Indeed, Xu et al. [2009] have shown that the SVM formulation is\nequivalent to a robust optimization (RO) formulation, in which an adversary\ndisplaces the training and testing points within a ball of pre-determined\nradius. In this work we explore a different kind of robustness, namely changing\neach data point with a Gaussian cloud centered at the sample. Loss is evaluated\nas the expectation of an underlying loss function on the cloud. This setup fits\nthe fact that in many applications, the data is sampled along with noise. We\ndevelop an RO framework, in which the adversary chooses the covariance of the\nnoise. In our algorithm named GURU, the tuning parameter is a spectral bound on\nthe noise, thus it can be estimated using physical or applicative\nconsiderations. Our experiments show that this framework performs as well as\nSVM and even slightly better in some cases. Generalizations for Mercer kernels\nand for the multiclass case are presented as well. We also show that our\nframework may be further generalized, using the technique of convex perspective\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 19:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}

While the first\nfour components have been extensively considered in numerical simulations of\nbinary galaxy mergers, the effect of a hot gaseous halo has usually been\nneglected even though it can contain up to 80% of the total gas within the\ngalaxy virial radius. We present a series of hydrodynamic simulations of major\nmergers of disc galaxies, that for the first time include a diffuse, rotating,\nhot gaseous halo. Through cooling and accretion, the hot halo can dissipate and\nrefuel the cold gas disc before and after a merger. This cold gas can\nsubsequently form stars, thus impacting the morphology and kinematics of the\nremnant. Simulations of isolated systems with total mass M~10^12Msun show a\nnearly constant star formation rate of ~5Msun/yr if the hot gaseous halo is\nincluded, while the star formation rate declines exponentially if it is\nneglected. We conduct a detailed study of the star formation efficiency during\nmergers and find that the presence of a hot gaseous halo reduces the starburst\nefficiency (e=0.5) compared to simulations without a hot halo (e=0.68).\nMoreover we find cases where the stellar mass of the merger remnant is lower\nthan the sum of the stellar mass of the two progenitor galaxies when evolved in\nisolation. This suggests a revision to semi-analytic galaxy formation models\nwhich assume that a merger always leads to enhanced star formation. We show\nthat adding the hot gas component has a significant effect on the kinematics\nand internal structure of the merger remnants, like an increased abundance of\nfast rotators and an r^(1/4) surface brightness profile at small scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 20:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}\nergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,\nwhich shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s.

This notion of effectively rendering states more coherent by\ndriving with incoherent thermal quantum noise is applied here to the\nopto-mechanical setting, where this effect occurs most naturally. We discuss\ntwo ways of describing this situation, one of them making use of stochastic\nsampling of Gaussian quantum states with respect to stationary classical\nstochastic processes.

The present\nstudy investigates the impact of STD and STF on the dynamics of continuous\nattractor neural networks (CANNs) and their potential roles in neural\ninformation processing. We find that STD endows the network with slow-decaying\nplateau behaviors-the network that is initially being stimulated to an active\nstate decays to a silent state very slowly on the time scale of STD rather than\non the time scale of neural signaling. This provides a mechanism for neural\nsystems to hold sensory memory easily and shut off persistent activities\ngracefully. With STF, we find that the network can hold a memory trace of\nexternal inputs in the facilitated neuronal interactions, which provides a way\nto stabilize the network response to noisy inputs, leading to improved accuracy\nin population decoding. Furthermore, we find that STD increases the mobility of\nthe network states. The increased mobility enhances the tracking performance of\nthe network in response to time-varying stimuli, leading to anticipative neural\nresponses. In general, we find that STD and STP tend to have opposite effects\non network dynamics and complementary computational advantages, suggesting that\nthe brain may employ a strategy of weighting them differentially depending on\nthe computational purpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2011 09:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 09:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 01:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Since traditional network measures (e.g., betweenness centrality)\nutilize a discrete link structure, complex systems must be transformed to this\nrepresentation in order to investigate network properties. However, in many\ndomains there may be uncertainty about the relationship structure and any\nuncertainty information would be lost in translation to a discrete\nrepresentation. Uncertainty may arise in domains where there is moderating link\ninformation that cannot be easily observed, i.e., links become inactive over\ntime but may not be dropped or observed links may not always corresponds to a\nvalid relationship. In order to represent and reason with these types of\nuncertainty, we move beyond the discrete graph framework and develop social\nnetwork measures based on a probabilistic graph representation.

We show that the model has two distinct\nregimes, at high and low volatilities, with different qualitative behavior. The\ntwo regimes are separated by a sharp transition, which is similar to a phase\ntransition in condensed matter physics. We study the behavior of the model in\nthe large volatility phase, and discuss the implications of the phase\ntransition for the pricing of interest rate derivatives. In the large\nvolatility phase, certain expectation values and convexity adjustments have an\nexplosive behavior. For sufficiently low volatilities the caplet smile is\nlog-normal to a very good approximation, while in the large volatility phase\nthe model develops a non-trivial caplet skew. The phenomenon discussed here\nimposes thus an upper limit on the volatilities for which the model behaves as\nintended.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2011 15:44:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2011 12:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 00:37:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2013 17:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

We first show that\nintermittent search strategies are actually widely observed at various scales.\nAt the macroscopic scale, this is for example the case of animals looking for\nfood ; at the microscopic scale, intermittent transport patterns are involved\nin reaction pathway of DNA binding proteins as well as in intracellular\ntransport. Second, we introduce generic stochastic models, which show that\nintermittent strategies are efficient strategies, which enable to minimize the\nsearch time. This suggests that the intrinsic efficiency of intermittent search\nstrategies could justify their frequent observation in nature. Last, beyond\nthese modeling aspects, we propose that intermittent strategies could be used\nalso in a broader context to design and accelerate search processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 17:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We find that two compounds CeOs4As12\nand CeOs4Sb12 are zero gap materials with band inversion between Os-d and Ce-f\norbitals, which are thus parent compounds of two and three-dimensional\ntopological insulators just like bulk HgTe. At low temperature, both compounds\nbecome topological Kondo insulators, which are Kondo insulators in the bulk,\nbut have robust Dirac surface states on the boundary. This new family of\ntopological insulators has two advantages compared to previous ones. First,\nthey can have good proximity effect with other superconducting FS compounds to\nrealize Majarona fermions. Second, the antiferromagnetism of CeOs4Sb12 at low\ntemperature provides a way to realize the massive Dirac fermion with novel\ntopological phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 16:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}
