Based on that model, we\nfurther study both the short-time and long-time evolutions of the open quantum\nsystem under repeated non-demolition measurements, and derive the\nmeasurement-modified decay rates of the excited state. In the cases with\nfrequent ideal measurements at zero-temperature, we re-obtain the same decay\nrate as that from the wave function collapse postulation (Nature {\\bf 405}, 546\n(2000)). The correction to the ideal decay rate is also obtained under the\nnon-ideal measurements. Especially, we find that the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno\neffects are possibly {\\it enhanced} by the non-ideal natures of measurements.\nFor the open system under measurements with arbitrary period, we generally\nderive the rate equation for the long-time evolution for the cases with {\\it\narbitrary} temperature and noise spectrum, and show that in the long-time\nevolution the noise spectrum is effectively tuned by the repeated measurements.\nOur approach is also able to describe the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects\ngiven by the phase modulation pulses, as well as the relevant quantum control\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2011 16:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We find an initial rapid adjustment in which the dif- ferential rotation\nof the convection zone viscously spreads into the radiative interior, thus\nforming a \"tachocline\". In polar regions the subsequent spread of the\ntachocline is halted by a counter-rotating meridional circulation cell which\ndevelops in the tachocline. Near the equator such a counter-rotating cell is\nmore intermittent and the tachocline penetration depth continues to increase,\nalbeit more slowly than previously predicted. In the magnetic models we impose\na dipolar field initially confined to the radiative interior. The behavior of\nthe magnetic models is very similar to their non-magnetic counter- parts.\nDespite being connected to the convection zone, very little angular momentum is\ntransferred between the convective and radiative regions. Therefore, while it\nappears that a magnetic field is not necessary to stop the tachocline spread,\nit also does not promote such a spread if connected to the convection zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2011 22:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The number of possible paths\ngrows exponentially with the number of celestial bodies. Therefore, the design\nof an optimal multiple gravity assist (MGA) trajectory is a NP-hard mixed\ncombinatorial-continuous problem. Its automated solution would greatly improve\nthe design of future space missions, allowing the assessment of a large number\nof alternative mission options in a short time. This work proposes to formulate\nthe complete automated design of a multiple gravity assist trajectory as an\nautonomous planning and scheduling problem. The resulting scheduled plan will\nprovide the optimal planetary sequence and a good estimation of the set of\nassociated optimal trajectories. The trajectory model consists of a sequence of\ncelestial bodies connected by twodimensional transfer arcs containing one DSM.\nFor each transfer arc, the position of the planet and the spacecraft, at the\ntime of arrival, are matched by varying the pericentre of the preceding\nswing-by, or the magnitude of the launch excess velocity, for the first arc.\nFor each departure date, this model generates a full tree of possible transfers\nfrom the departure to the destination planet. Each leaf of the tree represents\na planetary encounter and a possible way to reach that planet. An algorithm\ninspired by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is devised to explore the space of\npossible plans. The ants explore the tree from departure to destination adding\none node at the time: every time an ant is at a node, a probability function is\nused to select a feasible direction. This approach to automatic trajectory\nplanning is applied to the design of optimal transfers to Saturn and among the\nGalilean moons of Jupiter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 00:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-26"}

Based on the idea from general fractals and\nscaling, this paper proposes a dual competition hypothesis of city develop to\nexplain the value intervals and the special value, 1, of the power exponent.\nZipf's law and Pareto's law can be mathematically transformed into one another.\nBased on the Pareto distribution, a frequency correlation function can be\nconstructed. By scaling analysis and multifractals spectrum, the parameter\ninterval of Pareto exponent is derived as (0.5, 1]; Based on the Zipf\ndistribution, a size correlation function can be built, and it is opposite to\nthe first one. By the second correlation function and multifractals notion, the\nPareto exponent interval is derived as [1, 2). Thus the process of urban\nevolution falls into two effects: one is Pareto effect indicating city number\nincrease (external complexity), and the other Zipf effect indicating city size\ngrowth (internal complexity). Because of struggle of the two effects, the\nscaling exponent varies from 0.5 to 2; but if the two effects reach equilibrium\nwith each other, the scaling exponent approaches 1. A series of mathematical\nexperiments on hierarchical correlation are employed to verify the models and a\nconclusion can be drawn that if cities in a given region follow Zipf's law, the\nfrequency and size correlations will follow the scaling law.

The goal of this work is to present an analytical\nsolution technique for such astrophysical hypersonic blunt body problems.\nMethods: A method, developed by Schneider (1968, JFM, 31, 397) in the context\nof aeronautics, allows calculation of the galaxy's shape as long as the shape\nof the bow shock wave is known (so-called inverse method). In contrast to other\nanalytical models, the solution is valid in the whole flow region (from the\nstagnation point up to the bow shock wings) and in particular takes into\naccount velocity gradients along the streamlines. We compare our analytical\nresults with two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations carried out with an\nextended version of the VH-1 hydrocode which is based on the piecewise\nparabolic method with a Lagrangian remap. Results: It is shown that the applied\nmethod accurately predicts the galaxy's shape and the fluid variables in the\npost-shock flow, thus saving a tremendous amount of computing time for future\ninterpretations of similar objects. We also find that the method can be applied\nto arbitrary angles between the direction of the incoming flow and the axis of\nsymmetry of the body.

It is often beneficial to learn such a metric from the input training\ndata, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this\nwork, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed BoostMetric, for learning a\nquadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance\nmetric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the\nmetric remains positive definite. Semidefinite programming is often used to\nenforce this constraint, but does not scale well and easy to implement.\nBoostMetric is instead based on the observation that any positive semidefinite\nmatrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one\nmatrices. BoostMetric thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak\nlearners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The\nresulting methods are easy to implement, efficient, and can accommodate various\ntypes of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its\nweak learner is a positive semidefinite matrix with trace and rank being one\nrather than a classifier or regressor.

In this paper, we extend the ghost dark energy model to the\nuniverse with spatial curvature in the presence of interaction between dark\nmatter and dark energy. We study cosmological implications of this model in\ndetail. In the absence of interaction the equation of state parameter of ghost\ndark energy is always $w_D > -1 $ and mimics a cosmological constant in the\nlate time, while it is possible to have $w_D < -1 $ provided the interaction is\ntaken into account. When $k = 0$, all previous results of ghost dark energy in\nflat universe are recovered. To check the observational consistency, we use\nSupernova type Ia (SNIa) Gold sample, shift parameter of Cosmic Microwave\nBackground radiation (CMB) and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation peak from\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

Firstly, it aims to present, in an\neducational and non-technical fashion, the main ideas at the basis of Aerts'\ncreation-discovery view and hidden measurement approach: a fundamental\nexplanatory framework whose importance, in this author's view, has been\nseriously underappreciated by the physics community, despite its success in\nclarifying many conceptual challenges of quantum physics. Secondly, it aims to\nintroduce a new quantum-machine - that we call the delta-quantum-machine -\nwhich is able to reproduce the transmission and reflection probabilities of a\none-dimensional quantum scattering process by a Dirac delta-function potential.\nThe machine is used not only to demonstrate the pertinence of the above\nmentioned explanatory framework, in the general description of physical\nsystems, but also to illustrate (in the spirit of Aerts' epsilon-model) the\norigin of classical and quantum structures, by revealing the existence of\nprocesses which are neither classical nor quantum, but irreducibly\nintermediate. We do this by explicitly introducing what we call the k-model and\nby proving that its processes cannot be modelized by a classical or quantum\nscattering system. The third purpose of this work is to exploit the powerful\nmetaphor provided by our quantum-machine, to investigate the intimate relation\nbetween the concept of potentiality and the notion of non-spatiality, that we\ncharacterize in precise terms, introducing for this the new concept of\nprocess-actuality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 15:34:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 07:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 06:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}
