[Results] For physical conditions in\nwhich the surface reactions are important, our method provides a major\nimprovement over the rate equation approach, when benchmarked against the\nrigorous Monte Carlo results. For either very low or very high temperatures, or\nlarge grain radii, results from the rate equation are similar to those from our\nnew approach. Our method is faster than the Monte Carlo approach, but slower\nthan the rate equation approach. [Conclusions] The hybrid moment equation\napproach with a cutoff and switch scheme is applicable to large gas-grain\nnetworks, and is accurate enough to be used for astrochemistry studies. The\nlayered structure of the grain mantle could also be incorporated into this\napproach, although a full implementation of the grain micro-physics appears to\nbe difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 18:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-05"}

The most\nrelevant measures for a distance-oracle construction are: space, query time,\nand preprocessing time. There are strong distance-oracle constructions known\nfor planar graphs (Thorup, JACM'04) and, subsequently, minor-excluded graphs\n(Abraham and Gavoille, PODC'06). However, these require Omega(eps^{-1} n lg n)\nspace for n-node graphs. We argue that a very low space requirement is\nessential. Since modern computer architectures involve hierarchical memory\n(caches, primary memory, secondary memory), a high memory requirement in effect\nmay greatly increase the actual running time. Moreover, we would like data\nstructures that can be deployed on small mobile devices, such as handhelds,\nwhich have relatively small primary memory. In this paper, for planar graphs,\nbounded-genus graphs, and minor-excluded graphs we give distance-oracle\nconstructions that require only O(n) space.

The preprocessing times for our distance oracle are also faster\nthan those for the previously known constructions. For planar graphs, the\npreprocessing time is O(n lg^2 n).

In the \"hierarchical\" aTAM, two assemblies, both consisting of\nmultiple tiles, are allowed to aggregate together, whereas in the \"seeded\"\naTAM, tiles attach one at a time to a growing assembly. Adleman, Cheng, Goel,\nand Huang (\"Running Time and Program Size for Self-Assembled Squares\", STOC\n2001) showed how to assemble an n x n square in O(n) time in the seeded aTAM\nusing O(log n / log log n) unique tile types, where both of these parameters\nare optimal. They asked whether the hierarchical aTAM could allow a tile system\nto use the ability to form large assemblies in parallel before they attach to\nbreak the Omega(n) lower bound for assembly time. We show that there is a tile\nsystem with the optimal O(log n / log log n) tile types that assembles an n x n\nsquare using O(log^2 n) parallel \"stages\", which is close to the optimal\nOmega(log n) stages, forming the final n x n square from four n/2 x n/2\nsquares, which are themselves recursively formed from n/4 x n/4 squares, etc.\nHowever, despite this nearly maximal parallelism, the system requires\nsuperlinear time to assemble the square. We extend the definition of *partial\norder tile systems* studied by Adleman et al. in a natural way to hierarchical\nassembly and show that no hierarchical partial order tile system can build any\nshape with diameter N in less than time Omega(N), demonstrating that in this\ncase the hierarchical model affords no speedup whatsoever over the seeded\nmodel. We strengthen the Omega(N) time lower bound for deterministic seeded\nsystems of Adleman et al. to nondeterministic seeded systems.

Observations of the cloud in the 21-cm HI line\nreveal that the LLCC is very cold, with temperatures ranging from 15 K to 30 K,\nand is best fit with a model composed of two colliding components. The cloud\nhas associated 100 micron thermal dust emission, pointing to a somewhat low\ndust-to-gas ratio of 48 x 10^-22 MJy sr^-1 cm^2.

In this paper we present measurements of the angular\ncorrelation function of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the photometric catalog\nof the final data release (DR7) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS). The\nsample compromise ~ 1.5 x 10^6 LRGs distributed in 0.45 < z < 0.65, with a\ncharacteristic photometric error of ~ 0.05.

The velocity growth rate is recovered as $f \\sigma_8 = 0.53 \\pm\n0.42$ when no prior is imposed on the growth factor and the background geometry\nfollows a LCDM model with WMAP7+SNIa priors.

Today\nvendors in this field replace special purpose hardware accelerators by standard\nhardware like multicore chips and GPGPUs. Medical imaging algorithms are on the\nverge of employing High Performance Computing (HPC) technology, and are\ntherefore an interesting new candidate for optimization. This paper presents\nlow-level optimizations for the backprojection algorithm, guided by a thorough\nperformance analysis on four generations of Intel multicore processors\n(Harpertown, Westmere, Westmere EX, and Sandy Bridge).\n  We choose the RabbitCT benchmark, a standardized testcase well supported in\nindustry, to ensure transparent and comparable results. Our aim is to provide\nnot only the fastest possible implementation but also compare to performance\nmodels and hardware counter data in order to fully understand the results. We\nseparate the influence of algorithmic optimizations, parallelization, SIMD\nvectorization, and microarchitectural issues and pinpoint problems with current\nSIMD instruction set extensions on standard CPUs (SSE, AVX). The use of\nassembly language is mandatory for best performance. Finally we compare our\nresults to the best GPGPU implementations available for this open competition\nbenchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 20:31:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 15:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-08"}

We present a novel algorithm for\ncommunity detection that combines network structure with processes that support\ncreation and/or evolution of communities. The algorithm does not embrace the\nuniversal approach but instead tries to focus on social networks and model\ndynamic social interactions that occur on those networks. It identifies\nleaders, and communities that form around those leaders. It naturally supports\noverlapping communities by associating each node with a membership vector that\ndescribes node's involvement in each community. This way, in addition to\noverlapping communities, we can identify nodes that are good followers to their\nleader, and also nodes with no clear community involvement that serve as a\nproxy between several communities and are equally as important.

Nonlinear outcome of the interaction of accelerated particles\nthat run ahead of the shock, the so-called \"precursor\", with the unperturbed\nplasma of the shock upstream, is thought to facilitate additional acceleration\nof these particles and to possibly modify the hydrodynamic structure of the\nshock. We explore here the linear growth of kinetic modes appearing in the\nprecursor-upstream interaction in relativistic shocks propagating in non and\nweakly magnetized plasmas: electrostatic two-stream parallel mode and\nelectrostatic oblique modes. These modes are of particular interest because\nthey are the fastest growing modes known in this type of system. Using a\nsimplified distribution function for a dilute ultra-relativistic beam that is\nrelativistically hot in its own rest frame, yet has momenta that are narrowly\ncollimated in the frame of the cold upstream plasma into which it propagates,\nwe identify the fastest growing mode in the full $k$-space and calculate its\ngrowth rate. We consider all types of plasma (pairs and ions-electrons) and\nbeam (charged and charge-neutral). We find that unstable electrostatic modes\nare present in any type of plasma and for any shock parameters. We further find\nthat two modes, one parallel ($k_\\perp=0$) and the other one oblique ($k_\\perp\n\\sim k_\\|$), are competing for dominance and that either one may dominate the\ngrowth rate in different regions of the phase space. The dominant mode is\ndetermined mostly by the perpendicular spread of the accelerated particle\nmomenta in the upstream frame, which reflects the shock Lorentz factor. The\nparallel mode becomes more dominant in shocks with lower Lorentz factors (i.e.,\nwith larger momentum spreads). We briefly discuss possible implications of our\nresults for external shocks in gamma-ray burst sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 21:19:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 14:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Learning graphical models in two stages will\nhave problems because graph structure may change after considering the\nfeatures. The main contribution of this paper is the proposed method that\nlearns the graph structure and functions on the graph at the same time. General\ngraphical models with binary outcomes conditioned on predictive variables are\nproved to be equivalent to multivariate Bernoulli model. The reparameterization\nof the potential functions in graphical model by conditional log odds ratios in\nmultivariate Bernoulli model offers advantage in the representation of the\nconditional independence structure in the model. Additionally, we impose a\nstructure penalty on groups of conditional log odds ratios to learn the graph\nstructure. These groups of functions are designed with overlaps to enforce\nhierarchical function selection. In this way, we are able to shrink higher\norder interactions to obtain a sparse graph structure. Simulation studies show\nthat the method is able to recover the graph structure.

As the matter cools and expands into the\nvacuum, the evolution of the system shape depends sensitively on the dynamical\nresponse of the plasma under extreme conditions.

Indeed, the few measurements published to\ndate show a tantalizing behaviour in an energy region under intense\nexperimental and theoretical scrutiny, as signatures of a first-order phase\ntransition may appear there.

The evolution of\nlinearly forced turbulence towards a stationary final state, as indicated by\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS), is examined from a theoretical point of\nview based on symmetry arguments. In order to follow closely the DNS the flow\nis assumed to live in a cubic domain with periodic boundary conditions. The\nsimplicity of the linear forcing scheme allows one to re-write the problem as\none of decaying turbulence with a decreasing viscosity. Scaling symmetry\nconsiderations suggest that the system evolves to a stationary state, evolution\nthat may be understood as the gradual breaking of a larger approximate symmetry\nto a smaller exact symmetry. The same arguments show that the finiteness of the\ndomain is intimately related to the evolution of the system to a stationary\nstate at late times, as well as the consistency of this state with a high\ndegree of isotropy imposed by the symmetries of the domain itself. The\nfluctuations observed in the DNS for all quantities in the stationary state can\nbe associated with deviations from isotropy. Indeed, self-preserving isotropic\nturbulence models are used to study evolution from a direct dynamical point of\nview, emphasizing the naturalness of the Taylor microscale as a self-similarity\nscale in this system. In this context the stationary state emerges as a stable\nfixed point. Self-preservation seems to be the reason behind a noted similarity\nof the third order structure function between the linearly forced and freely\ndecaying turbulence, where again the finiteness of the domain plays an\nsignificant role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 08:06:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 May 2011 09:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

By applying an information\ntheoretic method to the spatiotemporal data of cell-phone locations, [C. Song\net al.

Inspired by their work, we address a similar\npredictability question in a different kind of human social activity:\nconversation events. The predictability in the sequence of one's conversation\npartners is defined as the degree to which one's next conversation partner can\nbe predicted given the current partner. We quantify this predictability by\nusing the mutual information. We examine the predictability of conversation\nevents for each individual using the longitudinal data of face-to-face\ninteractions collected from two company offices in Japan. Each subject wears a\nname tag equipped with an infrared sensor node, and conversation events are\nmarked when signals are exchanged between sensor nodes in close proximity. We\nfind that the conversation events are predictable to some extent; knowing the\ncurrent partner decreases the uncertainty about the next partner by 28.4% on\naverage. Much of the predictability is explained by long-tailed distributions\nof interevent intervals. However, a predictability also exists in the data,\napart from the contribution of their long-tailed nature. In addition, an\nindividual's predictability is correlated with the position in the static\nsocial network derived from the data.

Aspherical ejecta are produced by prescribing a latitudinal scaling or\nstretching of SN ejecta inputs obtained from 1-D non-LTE time-dependent\ncalculations. We study polarisation signatures as a function of inclination,\nshape factor, wavelength, line identity, post-explosion time. At early times,\ncancellation and optical-depth effects make the polarisation intrinsically low,\ncausing complicated sign reversals with inclination or continuum wavelength,\nand across line profiles. While the line polarisation is positive (negative)\nfor an oblate (prolate) morphology at the peak and in the red wing, the\ncontinuum polarisation may be of any sign. These complex polarisation\nvariations are produced not just by the asymmetric distribution of scatterers\nbut also of the flux. Our early-time signatures are in contradiction with\npredictions for a centrally illuminated aspherical nebula, although this\nbecomes a better approximation at nebular times. For a fixed asymmetry, our\nsynthetic continuum polarisation is generally low, may evolve non-monotonically\nduring the plateau phase, but it systematically rises as the ejecta become\noptically thin. Changes in polarization over time do not necessarily imply a\nchange in the asymmetry of the ejecta. The SN structure (e.g.,\ndensity/ionization) critically influences the level of polarisation.\nImportantly, a low polarisation (<0.5%) at early times does not necessarily\nimply a low degree of asymmetry as usually assumed. Asphericity influences\nline-profile morphology and the luminosity, which may compromise the accuracy\nof SN characteristics inferred from these.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 10:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

The Fermi surface always emerges as a very small\nfraction of the large parent Fermi surface detected at higher doping. This then\ncalls for some Fermi surface reconstruction to have occurred, as from a charged\ndensity wave, etc.. The paper refutes this reciprocal space approach, and shows\nthat many of the more recent detailed works taking this line are not consistent\nwith the data. The present author developed an alternative real-space\ninterpretation of these matters a couple of years ago. This was in terms of\ninteraction of the vortex array with the stripe array, using a 2D modelling for\nthe latter. This approach has here been revised slightly and copes well with\naddressing the wide variety of new data. The paper pursues and justifies the\nBEC/BCS, negative-U based, two-subsystem modelling advocated earlier, along\nwith the strength and geometry of the striping acquired in a strong magnetic\nfield. A wide variety of recent experiments are expounded to produce an overall\nappreciation of a situation far from being appropriately treated within a\nFermi-Landau quasiparticle framework. Indeed it is demonstrated that the\nuniversality of the 'QO' observations ensues from the fractional quantum Hall\neffect. The data all point to FQHE state with filling factor nu = 2/5. This\nstate in its genesis and expression finds a much greater alignment with the\nBEC/BCS crossover condition and the proximity of the HTSC materials to\nMott-Anderson localization than does any model for this highly correlated\nmaterial appealing to well-metallized Fermi-Landau quasiparticle physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 11:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2011 15:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-07"}

We also find that bar and disk colors are clearly correlated, and for\ngalaxies with small bars, the disk is, on average, redder than the bar colors,\nwhile for longer bars the bar then itself is redder, on average, than the disk.\nWe further find that galaxies with a prominent bulge are more likely to host\nlonger bars than those without bulges. We categorise our galaxy populations by\nhow the bar and/or ring are connected to the spiral arms. We find that galaxies\nwhose bars are directly connected to the spiral arms are preferentially bluer\nand that these galaxies host typically shorter bars. Within the scatter, we\nfind that stronger bars are found in galaxies which host a ring (and only a\nring).

In the classical implementation of two-way cuckoo\nhashing, the memory is partitioned into contiguous disjoint fixed-size buckets.\nEach item is hashed to two buckets, and may be stored in any of the positions\nwithin those buckets. Ref. [2] analyzed a variation in which the buckets are\ncontiguous and overlap. However, many systems retrieve data from secondary\nstorage in same-size blocks called pages. Fetching a page is a relatively\nexpensive process; but once a page is fetched, its contents can be accessed\norders of magnitude faster. We utilize this property of memory retrieval,\npresenting a variant of cuckoo hashing incorporating the following constraint:\neach bucket must be fully contained in a single page, but buckets are not\nnecessarily contiguous. Empirical results show that this modification increases\nmemory utilization and decreases the number of iterations required to insert an\nitem. If each item is hashed to two buckets of capacity two, the page size is\n8, and each bucket is fully contained in a single page, the memory utilization\nequals 89.71% in the classical contiguous disjoint bucket variant, 93.78% in\nthe contiguous overlapping bucket variant, and increases to 97.46% in our new\nnon-contiguous bucket variant. When the memory utilization is 92% and we use\nbreadth first search to look for a vacant position, the number of iterations\nrequired to insert a new item is dramatically reduced from 545 in the\ncontiguous overlapping buckets variant to 52 in our new non-contiguous bucket\nvariant.

In order to study these\nphenomena in large-scale assemblies of neurons, we consider networks of\nfiring-rate neurons with linear intrinsic dynamics and nonlinear coupling,\nbelonging to a few types of cell populations and receiving noisy currents.\nAsymptotic equations as the number of neurons tends to infinity (mean field\nequations) are rigorously derived based on a probabilistic approach. These\nequations are implicit on the probability distribution of the solutions which\ngenerally makes their direct analysis difficult. However, in our case, the\nsolutions are Gaussian, and their moments satisfy a closed system of nonlinear\nordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are much easier to study than the\noriginal stochastic network equations, and the statistics of the empirical\nprocess uniformly converge towards the solutions of these ODEs. Based on this\ndescription, we analytically and numerically study the influence of noise on\nthe collective behaviors, and compare these asymptotic regimes to simulations\nof the network. We observe that the mean field equations provide an accurate\ndescription of the solutions of the network equations for network sizes as\nsmall as a few hundreds of neurons. In particular, we observe that the level of\nnoise in the system qualitatively modifies its collective behavior, producing\nfor instance synchronized oscillations of the whole network, desynchronization\nof oscillating regimes, and stabilization or destabilization of stationary\nsolutions. These results shed a new light on the role of noise in shaping\ncollective dynamics of neurons, and gives us clues for understanding similar\nphenomena observed in biological networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 15:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 16:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

The frame we use is characterized by an arbitrary\nfunction $\\Upsilon$ with the help of which all the previously found solutions\ncan be reproduced. We show how the effect of inertia {\\it (which is mainly\nreproduced from $\\Upsilon$)} makes the total energy and momentum always\ndifferent from the well known result when we use the Riemannian connection\n${{\\widetilde \\Gamma}_\\alpha}^\\beta$. On the other hand, when use is made of\nthe covariant formulation of teleparallel gravity, which implies to take into\naccount the pure gauge connection, teleparallel gravity always yields the\nphysically relevant result for the energy and momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 10:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-25"}
