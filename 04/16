We go beyond past results in the\nliterature extending the series expansion up to the fourth order in the scale\nfactor, which implies the analysis of the deceleration, q_{0}, the jerk, j_{0}\nand the snap, s_{0}.

The interaction\nof tokens makes the dynamics of the protocol very difficult to analyze. In this\npaper we study the expected time to stabilization in terms of the initial\nconfiguration. It is straightforward that the algorithm achieves stabilization\nalmost surely from any initial configuration, and it is known that the\nworst-case expected time to stabilization (with respect to the initial\nconfiguration) is Theta(N^2). Our first contribution is to give an upper bound\nof 0.64 N^2 on the expected stabilization time, improving on previous upper\nbounds and reducing the gap with the best existing lower bound. We also\nintroduce an asynchronous version of the protocol, showing a similar O(N^2)\nconvergence bound in this case. Assuming that errors arise from the corruption\nof some number k of bits, where k is fixed independently of the size of the\nring, we show that the expected time to stabilization is O(N). This reveals a\nhitherto unknown and highly desirable property of Herman's algorithm: it\nrecovers quickly from bounded errors. We also show that if the initial\nconfiguration arises by resetting each bit independently and uniformly at\nrandom, then stabilization is significantly faster than in the worst case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 16:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-18"}

While HOT is a\nspecial case of our model, the resemblance to SOC is only partial; for example,\nthe distribution of cascades, while becoming increasingly heavy-tailed as the\nnumber of players increases, also deviates more significantly from a power law\nin this regime. Surprisingly, the system retains considerable robustness even\nas it becomes fractured, due in part to emergent cooperation between\nneighboring players. At the same time, increasing homogeneity promotes\nresilience against changes in the lightning distribution, giving rise to\nintermediate regimes where the system is robust to a particular distribution of\nadverse events, yet not very fragile to changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 16:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Thick-disk stars exhibit a strong trend of orbital eccentricity with\nmetallicity (about -0.2/dex), while the eccentricity does not change with\nmetallicity for the thin-disk subsample. The eccentricity is almost independent\nof Galactocentric radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginal\ngradient of the eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population.\nBoth subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity with\ndistance from the Galactic plane. The shapes of the eccentricity distributions\nfor the thin- and thick-disk populations are independent of distance from the\nplane, and include no significant numbers of stars with eccentricity above 0.6.\nAmong several contemporary models of disk evolution we consider, radial\nmigration appears to have played an important role in the evolution of the\nthin-disk population, but possibly less so for the thick disk, relative to the\ngas-rich merger or disk heating scenarios. We emphasize that more physically\nrealistic models and simulations need to be constructed in order to carry out\nthe detailed quantitative comparisons that our new data enable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 17:22:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 20:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Galileo's synoptic observations of the moons of\nJupiter and the phases of Venus starting in 1610, provided strong refutation of\nPtolemaic cosmology. In more modern times, the discovery of a relationship\nbetween period and luminosity in some pulsational variable stars led to the\ninference of the size of the Milky Way, the distance scale to the nearest\ngalaxies, and the expansion of the Universe. Distant explosions of supernovae\nwere used to uncover the existence of dark energy and provide a precise\nnumerical account of dark matter. Indeed, time-domain observations of transient\nevents and variable stars, as a technique, influences a broad diversity of\npursuits in the entire astronomy endeavor.

Gas content is set by a competition between inflow into and gas\nconsumption within the ISM, the latter being governed by the SF law, while the\nformer is impacted by both wind recycling and preventive feedback. Stochastic\nvariations in the inflow rate move galaxies off the equilibrium M*-Z and\nZ*-fgas relations in a manner correlated with star formation rate, and the\nscatter is set by the timescale to re-equilibrate. The evolution of both\nrelations from z=3-0 is slow, as individual galaxies tend to evolve mostly\nalong the relations.

In this\npaper, the Zipf's distribution of cities is abstracted as a q-sequence. Based\non this sequence, a self-similar hierarchy consisting of many levels is defined\nand the numbers of cities in different levels form a geometric sequence. An\nexponential distribution of the average size of cities is derived from the\nhierarchy. Thus we have two exponential functions, from which follows a\nhierarchical scaling equation. The results can be statistically verified by\nsimple mathematical experiments and observational data of cities. A theoretical\nfoundation is then laid for the conversion from Zipf's law to the hierarchical\nscaling law, and the latter can show more information about city development\nthan the former. Moreover, the self-similar hierarchy provides a new\nperspective for studying networks of cities as complex systems.

For a\ndisk galaxy with a typical flat rotation curve, our modeling results show that\nthe surface mass density monotonically decreases from the galactic center\ntoward periphery, according to Newtonian dynamics. In a large portion of the\ngalaxy, the surface mass density follows an approximately exponential law of\ndecay with respect to the galactic radial coordinate. Yet the radial scale\nlength for the surface mass density seems to be generally larger than that of\nthe measured brightness distribution, suggesting an increasing mass-to-light\nratio with the radial distance in a disk galaxy. In a nondimensionalized form,\nour mathematical system contains a dimensionless parameter which we call the\n\"galactic rotation number\" that represents the gross ratio of centrifugal force\nand gravitational force.
