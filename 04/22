These linear\nmeasurements are obtained by taking inner products of the low-rank matrix with\nrandom sensing matrices. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the number of\nmeasurements required are provided. It is shown that these conditions are sharp\nand the minimum-rank decoder is asymptotically optimal. The reliability\nfunction of this decoder is also derived by appealing to de Caen's lower bound\non the probability of a union. The sufficient condition also holds when the\nsensing matrices are sparse - a scenario that may be amenable to efficient\ndecoding. More precisely, it is shown that if the n\\times n-sensing matrices\ncontain, on average, \\Omega(nlog n) entries, the number of measurements\nrequired is the same as that when the sensing matrices are dense and contain\nentries drawn uniformly at random from the field. Analogies are drawn between\nthe above results and rank-metric codes in the coding theory literature. In\nfact, we are also strongly motivated by understanding when minimum rank\ndistance decoding of random rank-metric codes succeeds. To this end, we derive\ndistance properties of equiprobable and sparse rank-metric codes.

The large molecular gas reservoir\nis spatially resolved into two CO(1-0) components (north-east and south-west;\npreviously identified in CO 3-2 emission) with gas masses of 4.3 and 3.5 x\n10^10 (alpha_CO/0.8) Msun.

The two components are at approximately the same\nredshift, but separated by ~20 kpc in projection. The morphology is consistent\nwith that of an early-stage merger.

Rosenzweig in a class of\npredator-prey models. Two of the parameters in the models are crucial for the\nparadox. These two parameters are the prey's carrying capacity and prey's\nhalf-saturation for predation. Intuitively, increasing the carrying capacity\ndue to enrichment of the prey's environment should lead to a more stable\npredator-prey system. Analytically, it turns out that increasing the carrying\ncapacity always leads to an unstable predator-prey system that is susceptible\nto extinction from environmental random perturbations. This is the so-called\nparadox of enrichment. Our resolution here rests upon a closer investigation on\na dimensionless number $H$ formed from the carrying capacity and the prey's\nhalf-saturation. By recasting the models into dimensionless forms, the models\nare in fact governed by a few dimensionless numbers including $H$. The effects\nof the two parameters: carrying capacity and half-saturation are incorporated\ninto the number $H$. In fact, increasing the carrying capacity is equivalent\n(i.e. has the same effect on $H$) to decreasing the half-saturation which\nimplies more aggressive predation. Since there is no paradox between more\naggressive predation and instability of the predator-prey system, the paradox\nof enrichment is resolved.\n  We also further explore spatially dependent models for which the phase space\nis infinite dimensional. The spatially independent limit cycle which is\ngenerated by a Hopf bifurcation from an unstable steady state, is linearly\nstable in the infinite dimensional phase space. Numerical simulations indicate\nthat the basin of attraction of the limit cycle is riddled. This shows that\nspatial perturbations can sometimes (neither always nor never) remove the\nparadox of enrichment near the limit cycle!\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 20:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 19:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Our\nanalysis is based on a flared alpha-model of the DM Tau system, coupled to a\nlarge gas-grain chemical network. To account for production of complex\nmolecules, the chemical network is supplied with an extended set of surface\nreactions and photo-processes in ice mantles. Our disk model covers a wide\nrange of radii, 10-800 AU (from a Jovian planet-forming zone to the outer disk\nedge). Turbulent transport of gases and ices is implicitly modeled in full 2D\nalong with the time-dependent chemistry. Two regimes are considered, with high\nand low efficiency of turbulent mixing. The results of the chemical model with\nsuppressed turbulent diffusion are close to those from the laminar model, but\nnot completely. A simple analysis for the laminar chemical model to highlight\npotential sensitivity of a molecule to transport processes is performed. It is\nshown that the higher the ratio of the characteristic chemical timescale to the\nturbulent transport timescale for a given molecule, the higher the probability\nthat its column density will be affected by diffusion. We find that turbulent\ntransport enhances abundances and column densities of many gas-phase species\nand ices, particularly, complex ones. For such species a chemical steady-state\nis not reached due to long timescales associated with evaporation and surface\nphotoprocessing and recombination. In contrast, simple radicals and molecular\nions, which chemical evolution is fast and proceeds solely in the gas phase,\nare not much affected by dynamics. All molecules are divided into three groups\naccording to the sensitivity of their column densities to the turbulent\ndiffusion.

In this paper we introduce to this macroeconomic system the\nnotion of extinction analysis, a technique often used in the analysis of\necosystems, for the purposes of investigating the robustness of this network.\nIn particular, we subject the WTW to a principled set of in silico \"knockout\nexperiments,\" akin to those carried out in the investigation of food webs, but\nsuitably adapted to this macroeconomic network. Broadly, our experiments show\nthat over time the WTW moves to a \"robust yet fragile\" configuration where it\nis robust to random failures but fragile under targeted attack. This change in\nstability is highly correlated with the connectance (edge density) of the\nnetwork. Moreover, there is evidence of a sharp change in the structure of the\nnetwork in the 1960s and 1970s, where most measures of robustness rapidly\nincrease before resuming a declining trend. We interpret these results in the\ncontext in the post-World War II move towards globalization. Globalization\ncoincides with the sharp increase in robustness but also with a rise in those\nmeasures (e.g., connectance and trade imbalances) which correlate with\ndecreases in robustness. The peak of robustness is reached after the onset of\nglobalization policy but before the negative impacts are substantial. These\nanalyses depend on a simple model of dynamics that rebalances the trade flow\nupon network perturbation, the most dramatic of which is node deletion. More\nsubtle and textured forms of perturbation lead to the definition of other\nmeasures of node importance as well as vulnerability. We anticipate that\nexperiments and measures like these can play an important role in the\nevaluation of the stability of economic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2011 03:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 10:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The rank-size rule\nis a very simple scaling law followed by many observations of the ubiquitous\nempirical patterns in physical and social systems. Where there is a rank-size\ndistribution, there will be a hierarchy with cascade structure. However, the\nequivalence relation between the rank-size rule and the hierarchical scaling\nlaw remains to be mathematically demonstrated and empirically testified. In\nthis paper, theoretical derivation, mathematical experiments, and empirical\nanalysis are employed to show that the rank-size rule is equivalent in theory\nto the hierarchical scaling law (the Nn principle). Abstracting an ordered set\nof quantities in the form {1, 1/2,..., 1/k,...} from the rank-size rule, I\nprove a geometric subdivision theorem of the harmonic sequence (k=1, 2, 3,...).\nBy the theorem, the rank-size distribution can be transformed into a\nself-similar hierarchy, thus a power law can be decomposed as a pair of\nexponential laws, and further the rank-size power law can be reconstructed as a\nhierarchical scaling law. A number of ubiquitous empirical observations and\nrules, including Zipf's law, Pareto's distribution, fractals, allometric\nscaling, 1/f noise, can be unified into the hierarchical framework. The\nself-similar hierarchy can provide us with a new perspective of looking at the\ninverse power law of nature or even how nature works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2011 03:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-25"}

Another such system\nis BANKS, which enables data and schema browsing together with keyword-based\nsearch for relational databases. It models tuples as nodes in a graph,\nconnected by links induced by foreign key and other relationships. The size of\nthe database graph that BANKS uses is proportional to the sum of the number of\nnodes and edges in the graph.

Two low-frequency peaks are found: f=0.160\nc/d and a 2f peak. We show from a variety of arguments that the low-frequency\npeak, f, (rather than the 2f peak) is the rotational frequency. The\ncorresponding prediction of slow rotation is confirmed by a spectrum from which\nv sin i = 19 \\pm 1 km/s is obtained. During rotation, the brightness changes by\n0.5 ppt (parts-per-thousand, peak-to-peak).

Both the rotational brightness\nvariations and the pulsation amplitudes form a double wave during rotation. The\nvariations are in phase. The maximum pulsation amplitude occurs at the\nrotational phase with minimum brightness. Consequently, the 'normal' star KIC\n9700322 behaves such as an extremely weak chemically peculiar star. Since such\nvariations are also seen in some other A stars studied by Kepler, normal stars\nwith a symmetric surface may not exist.

The color temperature distribution shows an\nincreasing gradient from IRc2 toward source I, and no dominant temperature peak\nis seen at IRc2. The spectral energy distribution of IRc2 could be fitted by a\ntwo-temperature component model, and the \"warmer component\" of the infrared\nemission from IRc2 could be reproduced by scattering of radiation from source\nI. IRc2 itself is not self-luminous, but is illuminated and heated by an\nembedded luminous young stellar object located at source I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2011 06:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2011 15:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Superconductivity and magnetism are known to be antagonistic\nphenomena: superconductors expel weak external magnetic field (the Meissner\neffect) while a sufficiently strong magnetic field, in general, destroys\nsuperconductivity. In a seemingly contradictory statement, we show that a very\nstrong magnetic field can turn an empty space into a superconductor. The\nexternal magnetic field required for this effect should be about 10^{16} Tesla\n(eB ~ 1 GeV^2). The physical mechanism of the exotic vacuum superconductivity\nis as follows: in strong magnetic field the dynamics of virtual quarks and\nantiquarks is effectively one-dimensional because these electrically charged\nparticles tend to move along the lines of the magnetic field. In one spatial\ndimension a gluon-mediated attraction between a quark and an antiquark of\ndifferent flavors inevitably leads to formation of a colorless spin-triplet\nbound state (a vector analogue of the Cooper pair) with quantum numbers of an\nelectrically charged rho meson. Such quark-antiquark pairs condense to form an\nanisotropic inhomogeneous superconducting state similar to the Abrikosov vortex\nlattice in a type-II superconductor. The onset of the superconductivity of the\ncharged rho mesons should also induce an inhomogeneous superfluidity of the\nneutral rho mesons. The vacuum superconductivity should survive at very high\ntemperatures of typical Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) scale of 10^{12} K (T ~\n100 MeV).

We explore the conditions under which the pointer states of\nthe system become independent of time; so that a preferred basis of measurement\ncan be realized. As we show, these conditions include the so-called quantum\nlimit of decoherence and the so-called quantum measurement limit; as well as\nsome other specific conditions which are discussed in the paper. We relate the\nmathematical conditions for having time-independent pointer states to some\nclasses of possible symmetries in the Hamiltonian of the total composite\nsystem.

Typically, a network\ndesigner has to select among several alternatives which links to establish so\nthat the resulting network satisfies a given set of connectivity requirements\nand the cost of establishing the network links is as low as possible. The\nMinimum Spanning Tree problem, which is well-understood, is a nice example.\n  In this paper, we consider the natural scenario in which the connectivity\nrequirements are posed by selfish users who have agreed to share the cost of\nthe network to be established according to a well-defined rule. The design\nproposed by the network designer should now be consistent not only with the\nconnectivity requirements but also with the selfishness of the users.\nEssentially, the users are players in a so-called network design game and the\nnetwork designer has to propose a design that is an equilibrium for this game.\nAs it is usually the case when selfishness comes into play, such equilibria may\nbe suboptimal. In this paper, we consider the following question: can the\nnetwork designer enforce particular designs as equilibria or guarantee that\nefficient designs are consistent with users' selfishness by appropriately\nsubsidizing some of the network links? In an attempt to understand this\nquestion, we formulate corresponding optimization problems and present positive\nand negative results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2011 12:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 16:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-12"}

He collected comparative words lists of various languages\nduring his voyages aboard the Astrolabe from 1826 to 1829 and, in his work\nabout the geographical division of the Pacific, he proposed a method to measure\nthe degree of relation between languages.\n  The method used by the modern lexicostatistics, developed by Morris Swadesh\nin the 1950s, measures distances from the percentage of shared cognates, which\nare words with a common historical origin. The weak point of this method is\nthat subjective judgment plays a relevant role.\n  Recently, we have proposed a new automated method which is motivated by the\nanalogy with genetics. The new approach avoids any subjectivity and results can\nbe easily replicated by other scholars. The distance between two languages is\ndefined by considering a renormalized Levenshtein distance between pair of\nwords with the same meaning and averaging on the words contained in a list. The\nrenormalization, which takes into account the length of the words, plays a\ncrucial role, and no sensible results can be found without it.\n  In this paper we give a short review of our automated method and we\nillustrate it by considering the cluster of Malagasy dialects.

Every nonempty word is a power of\nan uniquely determined primitive word which is called the root of the former\none. The set of all roots of nonempty words of a language is called the root of\nthe language. The primitive words have interesting combinatorial properties\nwhich we consider in Section 2.

If the RV variation is indeed caused by a planetary companion, an\norbital solution with a period of P = 381 days, a semi-amplitude of K = 41 m/s,\nand an eccentricity of e = 0.25 fits the data best.

We focus on the effect of an expanding\nuniverse on massive objects on the scale of galaxies and clusters. Using\nNewtonian and general-relativistic approaches, we identify two important\ntime-dependent physical radii for such objects when the cosmological expansion\nis accelerating. The first radius, $r_F$, is that at which the total radial\nforce on a test particle is zero, which is also the radius of the largest\npossible circular orbit about the central mass $m$ and where the gas pressure\nand its gradient vanish. The second radius, $r_S$, which is \\approx r_F/1.6$,\nis that of the largest possible stable circular orbit, which we interpret as\nthe theoretical maximum size for an object of mass $m$. In contrast, for a\ndecelerating cosmological expansion, no such finite radii exist. Assuming a\ncosmological expansion consistent with a $\\Lambda$CDM concordance model, at the\npresent epoch we find that these radii put a sensible constraint on the typical\nsizes of both galaxies and clusters at low redshift. For galaxies, we also find\nthat these radii agree closely with zeroes in the radial velocity field in the\nneighbourhood of nearby galaxies, as inferred by Peirani & Pacheco from recent\nobservations of stellar velocities. We then consider the future effect on\nmassive objects of an accelerating cosmological expansion driven by phantom\nenergy, for which the universe is predicted to end in a `Big Rip' at a finite\ntime in the future at which the scale factor becomes singular. In particular,\nwe present a novel calculation of the time prior to the Big Rip that an object\nof a given mass and size will become gravitationally unbound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2011 14:48:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 16:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 16:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The one-loop\nevaluation over the space of flat connections reduces to the matrix integral by\nwhich the ${\\cal N}=4$ superconformal index is expressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2011 15:39:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 08:35:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 21:29:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 19:36:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2011 14:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We consider the Minimum Flip\nSupertree problem, where the input trees are transformed into a 0/1/?-matrix,\nsuch that each row represents a taxon, and each column represents an inner node\nof one of the input trees. Our goal is to find a perfect phylogeny for the\ninput matrix requiring a minimum number of 0/1-flips, that is, corrections of\n0/1-entries in the matrix. The problem is known to be NP-complete. Here, we\npresent a parameterized data reduction with polynomial running time. The data\nreduction guarantees that the reduced instance has a solution if and only if\nthe original instance has a solution. We then make our data reduction\nparameter-independent by using upper bounds. This allows us to preprocess an\ninstance, and to solve the reduced instance with an arbitrary method. Different\nfrom an existing data reduction for the consensus tree problem, our reduction\nallows us to draw conclusions about certain entries in the matrix. We have\nimplemented and evaluated our data reduction. Unfortunately, we find that the\nMinimum Flip Supertree problem is also hard in practice: The amount of\ninformation that can be derived during data reduction diminishes as instances\nget more \"complicated\", and running times for \"complicated\" instances quickly\nbecome prohibitive. Still, our method offers another route of attack for this\nrelevant phylogenetic problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2011 15:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-25"}
