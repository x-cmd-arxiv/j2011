The\nkey is to establish an appropriate notion of state-space collapse in terms of\nsteady-state moments of weighted queue length differences, and use this\nstate-space collapse result when setting the Lyapunov drift equal to zero.

Capella is among the few binary stars with two evolved giant\ncomponents. The hotter component is a chromospherically active star within the\nHertzsprung gap, while the cooler star is possibly helium-core burning. Aims.\nThe known inclination of the orbital plane from astrometry in combination with\nprecise radial velocities will allow very accurate masses to be determined for\nthe individual Capella stars. This will constrain their evolutionary stage and\npossibly the role of the active star's magnetic field on the dynamical\nevolution of the binary system. Methods. We obtained a total of 438\nhigh-resolution \\'echelle spectra during the years 2007-2010 and used the\nmeasured velocities to recompute the orbital elements.

Each Nelder-Mead iteration is associated\nwith a nondegenerate simplex defined by n+1 vertices and their function values;\na typical iteration produces a new simplex by replacing the worst vertex by a\nnew point. Despite the method's widespread use, theoretical results have been\nlimited: for strictly convex objective functions of one variable with bounded\nlevel sets, the algorithm always converges to the minimizer; for such functions\nof two variables, the diameter of the simplex converges to zero, but examples\nconstructed by McKinnon show that the algorithm may converge to a nonminimizing\npoint.\n  This paper considers the restricted Nelder-Mead algorithm, a variant that\ndoes not allow expansion steps. In two dimensions we show that, for any\nnondegenerate starting simplex and any twice-continuously differentiable\nfunction with positive definite Hessian and bounded level sets, the algorithm\nalways converges to the minimizer.

In this paper, we make an attempt to shed some insight into this\nerratic behavior of $R_n$, by drawing an analogy with the realm of physics of\nwave propagation, in particular, the elementary theory of scattering and\ndiffraction. It turns out that there are two types of behavior of wave\ndiffraction patterns formed by crystals, which are correspondingly analogous to\nthe two types of patterns of $R_n$. When the crystal is perfect, the\ndiffraction intensity spectrum exhibits very sharp peaks, a.k.a. Bragg peaks,\nat wavelengths of full constructive interference. These wavelengths correspond\nto the frequencies of the harmonic waves of the oscillatory mode of $R_n$. On\nthe other hand, when the crystal is imperfect and there is a considerable\ndegree of disorder in its structure, the Bragg peaks disappear, and the\nbehavior of this mode is analogous to the one where $R_n$ is convergent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2011 14:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

At a given neutron star mass, M, the radius of a star with\nan accreted crust is therefore larger, by DR(M), than for usually considered\nstar built of catalyzed matter. Using a compressible liquid drop model of\nnuclei, we calculate, within the one-component plasma approximation, the EOSs\ncorresponding to different nuclear compositions of ashes of X-ray bursts in\nLMXB. These EOSs are then applied for studying the effect of different\nformation scenarios on the neutron-star mass-radius relation. Assuming the SLy\nEOS for neutron star's liquid core, derived by Douchin & Haensel (2001), we\nfind that at M=1.4 M_sun the star with accreted crust has a radius more than\n100 m larger that for the crust of catalyzed matter. Using smallness of the\ncrust mass compared to M, we derive a formula that relates DR(M) to the\ndifference in the crust EOS. This very precise formula gives also analytic\ndependence of DR on M and R of the reference star built of catalyzed matter.\nThe formula is valid for any EOS of the liquid core. Rotation of neutron star\nmakes DR(M) larger.

This fraction\nincreases to ~65% for more massive halos. The peak of star formation efficiency\nshifts toward lower mass halos from z~1 to z~0. The stellar mass in low-mass\nhalos grows mostly by star formation since z~1, while in high-mass halos most\nof the stellar mass is assembled by mergers.
