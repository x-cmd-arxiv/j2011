For propositional variables\np_1,...,p_n, =(p_1,...,p_(n-1);p_n) intuitively states that the value of p_n is\ndetermined by those of p_1,...,p_(n-1). Sevenster (J. Logic and Computation,\n2009) showed that satisfiability for modal dependence logic is complete for\nnondeterministic exponential time. In this paper we consider fragments of modal\ndependence logic obtained by restricting the set of allowed propositional\nconnectives. We show that satisfibility for poor man's dependence logic, the\nlanguage consisting of formulas built from literals and dependence atoms using\nconjunction, necessity and possibility (i.e., disallowing disjunction), remains\nNEXPTIME-complete. If we only allow monotone formulas (without negation, but\nwith disjunction), the complexity drops to PSPACE-completeness. We also extend\nV\\\"a\\\"an\\\"anen's language by allowing classical disjunction besides dependence\ndisjunction and show that the satisfiability problem remains NEXPTIME-complete.\nIf we then disallow both negation and dependence disjunction, satistiability is\ncomplete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. In this way we\ncompletely classify the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem\nfor all restrictions of propositional and dependence operators considered by\nV\\\"a\\\"an\\\"anen and Sevenster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 16:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

We note that in a sense the\ninformation in the system is already lost to an observer at infinity. Once the\nsystem is too close to the horizon it does not have enough energy to send its\ninformation back because the information carrying quanta would get redshifted\nto a point where they get confused with Hawking radiation. If one attempts to\nturn the infalling system around and bring it back to infinity for observation\nthen it will experience Unruh radiation from the required acceleration. This\nradiation can excite the bits in the system carrying the information, thus\nreducing the fidelity of this information. We find the radius where the\ninformation is essentially lost in this way, noting that this radius depends on\nthe energy gap (and coupling) of the system. We look for some universality by\nusing the highly degenerate BPS ground states of a quantum gravity theory\n(string theory) as our information storage device. For such systems one finds\nthat the critical distance to the horizon set by Unruh radiation is the\ngeometric mean of the black hole radius and the radius of the extremal hole\nwith quantum numbers of the BPS bound state. Overall, the results suggest that\ninformation in gravity theories should be regarded not as a quantity contained\nin a system, but in terms of how much of this information is accessible to\nanother observer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 16:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

The fit with data\ndefines a limit for the consistency and validity of the approach taken and\nshows that, within this limit, the model is almost unconstrained, but quite\npredictive, producing power spectra of density perturbations extremely near\nscale invariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 16:53:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 11:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-08"}

Based on the ratio of the far-UV to Halpha luminosity, the\nUV spectral energy distribution, and the far-UV and Halpha morphology, we\nconclude that the warm, ionized gas in the cluster cores is photoionized by\nmassive, young stars in all but a few (Abell 1991, Abell 2052, Abell 2580)\nsystems. We show that the extended filaments, when considered separately,\nappear to be star-forming in the majority of cases, while the nuclei tend to\nhave slightly lower far-UV luminosity for a given Halpha luminosity, suggesting\na harder ionization source or higher extinction. We observe a slight offset in\nthe UV/Halpha ratio from the expected value for continuous star formation which\ncan be modeled by assuming intrinsic extinction by modest amounts of dust\n(E(B-V) ~ 0.2), or a top-heavy IMF in the extended filaments. The measured star\nformation rates vary from ~ 0.05 Msun/yr in the nuclei of non-cooling systems,\nconsistent with passive, red ellipticals, to ~ 5 Msun/yr in systems with\ncomplex, extended, optical filaments. Comparing the estimates of the star\nformation rate based on UV, Halpha and infrared luminosities to the\nspectroscopically-determined X-ray cooling rate suggests a star formation\nefficiency of 14(+18)(-8)%. This value represents the time-averaged fraction,\nby mass, of gas cooling out of the intracluster medium which turns into stars,\nand agrees well with the global fraction of baryons in stars required by\nsimulations to reproduce the stellar mass function for galaxies. This result\nprovides a new constraint on the efficiency of star formation in accreting\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This article presents a\ngeneral method for this problem based on a flexible parameterization device\ncalled \"anchors\", which captures local or global features of the fields. A\nclassification of all relevant data into two categories closely cooperates with\nthe anchor concept to enable systematic use of datasets of different sources\nand disciplinary natures. In particular, nonlinearity in the \"forward models\"\nis handled automatically. Treatment of measurement and model errors is\nsystematic and integral in the method; however the method is also suitable in\nthe usual setting where one does not have reliable information about these\nerrors. Compared to a state-space approach, the anchor parameterization renders\nthe task in a parameter space of radically reduced dimension; consequently,\neasier and more rigorous statistical inference, interpretation, and sampling\nare possible.

In fact, we find that in\nnon interacting systems the exchange with fermions in the initial state of the\nchain always has a destructive effect, and we prove that it can be completely\nremoved in the isotropic XX model by initializing the chain in a ferromagnetic\nstate.

In a breakthrough sequence of papers published in 1992 and 1993,\nSchulman gave non-constructive proofs of the existence of general methods to\nemulate any two-party interactive protocol such that: (1) the emulation\nprotocol takes a constant-factor longer than the original protocol, and (2) if\nthe emulation protocol is executed over a noisy channel, then the probability\nthat the emulation protocol fails is exponentially small in the total length of\nthe protocol. Unfortunately, Schulman's emulation procedures either only work\nin a model with a large amount of shared randomness, or are non-constructive in\nthat they rely on the existence of good tree codes. The only known proofs of\nthe existence of good tree codes are non-constructive, and finding an explicit\nconstruction remains an important open problem. Indeed, randomly generated tree\ncodes are not good tree codes with overwhelming probability.\n  In this work, we revisit the problem of reliable interactive communication,\nand obtain the following results: We introduce a new notion of goodness for a\ntree code, and define the notion of a potent tree code. We believe that this\nnotion is of independent interest. We prove the correctness of an explicit\nemulation procedure based on any potent tree code. We show that a randomly\ngenerated tree code (with suitable constant alphabet size) is a potent tree\ncode with overwhelming probability. Furthermore we are able to partially\nderandomize this result using only O(n) random bits, where $n$ is the depth of\nthe tree.\n  These results allow us to obtain the first fully explicit emulation procedure\nfor reliable interactive communication over noisy channels with a constant\ncommunication overhead, and exponentially small failure probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 06:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-06"}

These associated absorption line systems (AALs) are usually\ninterpreted as absorbers that are either intrinsic to the quasar and its host,\nor arising from external galaxies clustering around the quasar. Using composite\nspectra of ~1,800 MgII AAL quasars selected from SDSS DR7 at 0.4<~ z<~2, we\nshow that quasars with AALs with v_off<1500 km/s have a prominent excess in\n[OII]3727 emission (detected at >7sigma) at rest to the quasar host, compared\nto unabsorbed quasars.

Some methods,\nsuch as image-guided radiation therapy and dose-guided radiation therapy, aimto\ncompensate thismissing information through periodic CT acquisitions. The aimis\nto adapt patient's position, beam configuration or prescribed dose for a\ndosimetric compliance. Methods. -We evaluated organmotion (and repletion) for\n54 patients after having computed the original ballistic on a new CT scan\nacquisition. A new delineation was done on the prostate, bladder and rectum to\ndetermine the newdisplacements and define organ dosesmistakes (equivalent\nuniformdose, average dose and dose-volume histograms). Results. - The new CT\nacquisitions confirmed that bladder and rectal volumes were not constant during\nsessions. Some cases showed that previously validated treatment plan became\nunsuitable. A proposed solution is to correct dosimetries when bladder volume\nmodifications are significant. The result is an improvement for the stability\nof bladder doses, D50 error is reduced by 25.3%, mean dose error by 5.1% and\nequivalent uniform dose error by 2.6%. For the rectum this method decreases\nerrors by only 1%. This process can reduce the risk of mismatch between the\ninitial scan and following treatment sessions. Conclusion. - For the\nproposedmethod, the cone-beamCT is necessary to properly position the isocenter\nand to quantify bladder and rectal volume variation and deposited doses. The\ndosimetries are performed in the event that bladder (or rectum) volume\nmodification limits are exceeded. To identify these limits, we have calculated\nthat a tolerance of 10% for the equivalent uniformdose (compared to the initial\nvalue of the first dosimetry), this represents 11% of obsolete dosimetries for\nthe bladder, and 4% for the rectum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 09:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-06"}

Our aim\nis to study the structure and spectral shape of the emission from the\ncentral-parsec region of Cen A. As a target of the Southern Hemisphere VLBI\nmonitoring program TANAMI (Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Milliarcsecond\nInterferometry), VLBI observations of Cen A are made regularly at 8.4 and 22.3\nGHz with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and associated telescopes in\nAntarctica, Chile, and South Africa. The first dual-frequency images of this\nsource are presented along with the resulting spectral index map. An angular\nresolution of 0.4 mas x 0.7 mas is achieved at 8.4 GHz, corresponding to a\nlinear scale of less than 0.013 pc. Hence, we obtain the highest resolution\nVLBI image of Cen A, comparable to previous space-VLBI observations. By\ncombining with the 22.3 GHz image, which has been taken without contributing\ntransoceanic baselines at somewhat lower resolution, we present the\ncorresponding dual-frequency spectral index distribution along the sub-parsec\nscale jet revealing the putative emission regions for recently detected\ngamma-rays from the core region by Fermi/LAT.

We propose a model for the\nUHECR contribution from the spin-down power of black holes (BHs) in LLAGN,\nwhich present a jet power $P_{\\mathrm{j}} \\leqslant 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This\nis in contrast to the opinion that only high-luminosity AGN can accelerate\nparticles to energies $ \\geqslant 50$ EeV. We rewrite the equations which\ndescribe the synchrotron self-absorbed emission of a non-thermal particle\ndistribution to obtain the observed radio flux density from flat-spectrum core\nsources and its relationship to the jet power. In general, the jet power\nprovides the UHECR luminosity and so, its relationship to the observed radio\nflux density. We found that the UHECR luminosity is dependent on the observed\nradio flux density, the distance to the AGN, and the BH mass, where the\nparticle acceleration regions can be sustained by the magnetic energy\nextraction from spinning BHs and where the strength of the magnetic field at\nthe sites of particle acceleration scales with the maximum value of the BH\nmagnetic field, which is $\\sim 10^4$ gauss for a BH of $10^9 M_{\\odot}$. We\napply the model to M87 and Cen A, two possible sources of UHECRs, whose jet\nparameters can be inferred from observational data. Next, we use a complete\nsample of 29 steep spectrum radio sources with a total flux density greater\nthan 0.5 Jy at 5 GHz to make predictions for the maximum particle energy,\nluminosity, and flux of the UHECRs from nearby AGN. Using our proposed model,\nit is possible to show that LLAGN can be sites of the origin of UHECRs. In\nadditional, the scenario in which the contribution to the UHECR flux from many\nweak radio galaxies would dominate over that from a few strong radio galaxies,\nor vice-versa, should be substantiated with further statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 12:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-06"}

We gather a wide sample of galaxies\nthat have been observed at submm wavelengths to model their Spectral Energy\nDistributions using submm observations and then without submm observational\nconstraints in order to quantify the error on the dust mass when submm data are\nnot available. Our model does not make strong assumptions on the dust\ntemperature distribution to precisely avoid submm biaises in the study. Our\nsample includes 52 galaxies observed at submm wavelengths. Out of these, 9\ngalaxies show an excess in submm which is not accounted for in our fiducial\nmodel, most of these galaxies being low- metallicity dwarfs. We chose to add an\nindependant very cold dust component (T=10K) to account for this excess. We\nfind that metal-rich galaxies modelled with submm data often show lower dust\nmasses than when modelled without submm data. Indeed, these galaxies usually\nhave dust SEDs that peaks at longer wavelengths and require constraints above\n160 um to correctly position the peak and sample the submillimeter slope of\ntheir SEDs and thus correctly cover the dust temperature distribution. On the\nother hand, some metal-poor dwarf galaxies modelled with submm data show higher\ndust masses than when modelled without submm data. Using submm constraints for\nthe dust mass estimates, we find a tightened correlation of the dust-to-gas\nmass ratio with the metallicity of the galaxies. We also often find that when\nthere is a submm excess present, it occurs preferentially in low-metallicity\ngalaxies. We analyse the conditions for the presence of this excess and find a\nrelation between the 160/850 um ratio and the submm excess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 12:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This experimental evidence is a very robust\nindication of new physics, but is not the only reason to go beyond the Standard\nModel. The existence of some theoretical issues supports the idea of a wider\nframework, supersymmetry being the most popular one. In this thesis, several\nsupersymmetric neutrino mass models have been studied. In the first part, the\nphenomenology of models with bilinear-like R-parity violation is discussed in\ngreat detail, highlighting the most distinctive signatures at colliders and low\nenergy experiments. In particular, the correlations between the LSP decay and\nneutrino physics are shown to be a powerful tool to put this family of models\nunder experimental test. Other important signatures are investigated as well,\nlike majoron emission in charged lepton decays for the case of models with\nspontaneous breaking of R-parity. A very different approach is followed in the\nsecond part of the thesis. Supersymmetric models with a Left-Right symmetry\nhave all the ingredients to incorporate a type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino\nmasses and conserve R-parity at low energies. In this case, which only allows\nfor indirect tests, the generation of neutrino masses at the high seesaw scale\nis encoded at low energies in the slepton soft masses. Contrary to minimal\nseesaw models, sizeable flavor violation in the right slepton sector is\nexpected. Its experimental observation would be a clear hint of an underlying\nLeft-Right symmetry, providing valuable information about physics at very high\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 13:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In our previous paper (Bak-Steslicka and Jakimiec, 2005) we have\nworked out another method of deriving electron density, in which it is not\nnecessary to assume what is the extension of a kernel along the line of sight.\nThe point is that many flares, during their decay phase, evolve along the\nsequence of steady-state models [quasi-steady-state (QSS) evolution] and then\nthe scaling law, derived for steady-state models, can be used to determine the\nelectron density. The aim of the present paper is: (1) to improve the two\nmethods of density determination, (2) to compare the densities obtained with\nthe two methods. We have selected a number of flares which showed QSS evolution\nduring the decay phase. For these flares the electron density, N, has been\nderived by means of standard method and with our QSS method. Comparison of the\nN values obtained with the two different methods allowed us: (1) to test the\nobtained densities, (2) to evaluate the volume filling factor of the SXR\nemitting plasma. Generally, we have found good agreement (no large systematic\ndifference) between the values of electron density obtained with the two\nmethods, but for some cases the values can differ by a factor up to 2.

A magnetic field on\nthe surface of the secondary star forces a fraction of the ejected material to\ncorotate with the star, and hence the binary system. The ejected material thus\ntakes angular momentum from the binary orbit and the orbital period decreases.\nWe show that for sufficiently strong magnetic fields on the surface of the\nsecondary star, the total change to the orbital period could even be negative\nduring a nova outburst, contrary to previous expectations. Accurate\ndeterminations of pre- and post-outburst orbital periods of recurrent nova\nsystems could test the new mechanism, in addition to providing meaningful\nconstraints on otherwise difficult to measure physical quantities.

It is shown that information can be stored and retrieved using the\noptical diffraction patterns obtained by the illumination of a large array of\ncantilevers by a monochromatic light source. In thermo-mechanical probe\nstorage, the information is stored as a sequence of indentations on the polymer\nmedium. To retrieve the information, the array of probes is actuated by\napplying a bending force to the cantilevers. Probes positioned over\nindentations experience deflection by the depth of the indentation, probes over\nthe flat media remain un-deflected. Thus the array of actuated probes can be\nviewed as an irregular optical grating, which creates a data-dependent\ndiffraction pattern when illuminated by laser light. We develop a low\ncomplexity modulation scheme, which allows the extraction of information stored\nin the pattern of indentations on the media from Fourier coefficients of the\nintensity of the diffraction pattern. We then derive a low-complexity maximum\nlikelihood sequence detection algorithm for retrieving the user information\nfrom the Fourier coefficients. The derivation of both the modulation and the\ndetection schemes is based on the Fraunhofer formula for data-dependent\ndiffraction patterns. We show that for as long as the Fresnel number F<0.1, the\noptimal channel detector derived from Fraunhofer diffraction theory does not\nsuffer any significant performance degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 15:40:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 11:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Near this sampling interval, the data points\nin the PDF are minimally correlated, which results in more reliable uncertainty\nprediction. Furthermore, refinements using sparsely sampled data may run many\ntimes faster than using oversampled data.

Submicroscopic\nmechanics based on this concept is discussed and employed for in-depth study of\nthe nucleon-nucleon interaction. It is argued that a deformation coat is\ndeveloped in the real space around the nucleon (as is the case with any other\ncanonical particle such as electron, muon, etc.) and that they are the\ndeformation coats that are responsible for the appearance of nuclear forces.\nOne more source of nuclear forces is associated with inerton clouds,\nexcitations of the space tessel-lattice (the excitations are a substructure of\nnucleons' matter waves), which accompany moving nucleons as in the case of any\nother canonical particles. Two nuclear systems are under consideration: the\ndeuteron and a weight nucleus. It is shown that a weight nucleus is a cluster\nof interacting protons and neutrons. The condition of the cluster stability is\nobtained in the framework of the statistical mechanical approach. On the whole,\nthe paper proposes a radically new approach to a very old unsolved problem, the\norigin of the nuclear forces, allowing the understanding mechanism(s) occurring\nat low energy nuclear transmutations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 10:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-14"}
