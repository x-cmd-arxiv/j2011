In the opposite case of\nhigh-velocities the test particle systematically loses its energy due to the\ninteraction with a stochastic electric field. The net effect of the\nfluctuations is the systematic reduction of the total energy loss (i.e. the sum\nof the polarization and stochastic energy losses) at vanishing magnetic field\nand reduction or enhancement at strong field depending on the velocity of the\nparticle. It is found that the energy loss of the slow heavy ion contains an\nanomalous term which depends logarithmically on the projectile mass. The\nphysical origin of this anomalous term is the coupling between the cyclotron\nmotion of the plasma electrons and the long-wavelength, low-frequency\nfluctuations produced by the projectile ion.

Methods: We\nuse the SATIRE model and compare modeled total solar irradiance (TSI) with TSI\nmeasurements between 2003 and 2009. Spectral solar irradiance over 200-1630nm\nis compared with the SIM instrument on SORCE between 2004 and 2009 during a\nperiod of decline from moderate activity to the recent solar minimum in 10 nm\nbands and for three spectral regions of significant interest: the UV integrated\nover 200-300nm, the visible over 400-691nm and the IR between 972-1630 nm.\nResults: The model captures 97% of observed TSI variation. In the spectral\ncomparison, rotational variability is well reproduced, especially between 400\nand 1200 nm. The magnitude of change in the long-term trends is many times\nlarger in SIM at almost all wavelengths while trends in SIM oppose SATIRE in\nthe visible between 500 and 700nm and between 1000 and 1200nm. We discuss the\nremaining issues with both SIM data and the identified limits of the model,\nparticularly with the way facular contributions are dealt with, the limit of\nflux identification in MDI magnetograms during solar minimum and the model\natmospheres in the IR employed by SATIRE. It is unlikely that improvements in\nthese areas will significantly enhance the agreement in the long-term trends.\nThis disagreement implies that some mechanism other than surface magnetism is\ncausing SSI variations, in particular between 2004 and 2006, if the SIM data\nare correct. Since SATIRE was able to reproduce UV irradiance between 1991 and\n2002 from UARS, either the solar mechanism for SSI variation fundamentally\nchanged around the peak of cycle 23, or there is an inconsistency between UARS\nand SORCE UV measurements.

We detect stars in the RGB and TP-AGB\n(carbon star) phases in all outer fields, but not younger stars such as those\npresent at smaller radii. The RGB star density profile is well fit by either a\nde Vaucouleurs profile or a power-law profile, but has more stars at large\nradii than a single exponential. To within the uncertainties, there are no\nradial gradients in the RGB color or carbon-to-RGB-star ratio at large radii.\nConclusions. The galaxies have faint outer stellar envelopes that are not\ntidally truncated within the range of radii addressed by our study. The density\nprofiles suggest that these are not outward extensions of the inner disks, but\nare instead distinct stellar halos. This agrees with other work on galaxies of\nsimilar morphology.

Alternative\nexplanations requiring part of the dipole to be primordial have received\nsupport from measurements of large-scale bulk flows. A test of the two\nhypothesis is whether other cosmic dipoles produced by collapsed structures\nlater than last scattering coincide with the CMB dipole. One background is the\ncosmic infrared background (CIB) whose absolute spectrum was measured to ~30%\nby the COBE satellite. Over the 100 to 500 {\\mu}m wavelength range its spectral\nenergy distribution can provide a probe of its alignment with CMB. This is\ntested with the COBE FIRAS dataset which is available for such a measurement\nbecause of its low noise and frequency resolution important for Galaxy\nsubtraction. Although the FIRAS instrument noise is in principle low enough to\ndetermine the CIB dipole, the Galactic foreground is sufficiently close\nspectrally to keep the CIB dipole hidden. A similar analysis is performed with\nDIRBE, which - because of the limited frequency coverage - provides a poorer a\ndataset. We discuss strategies for measuring the CIB dipole with future\ninstruments to probe the tilt and apply it to the Planck, Herschel and the\nproposed Pixie missions. We demonstrate that a future FIRAS-like instrument\nwith instrument noise a factor of ~10 lower than FIRAS would make a\nstatistically significant measurement of the CIB dipole.

Of particular interest is the case of HD\n100546, a Herbig Be star that presents a gap within the first 13 AU of its\nprotoplanetary disk, that may originate in the dynamical interactions of a\nforming planet. We gathered a large amount of new interferometric data using\nthe AMBER/VLTI instrument in the H- and K-bands to spatially resolve the warm\ninner disk and constrain its structure. Then, combining these measurements with\nphotometric observations, we analyze the circumstellar environment of HD 100546\nin the light of a passive disk model based on 3D Monte-Carlo radiative\ntransfer. Finally, we use hydrodynamical simulations of gap formation by\nplanets to predict the radial surface density profile of the disk and test the\nhypothesis of ongoing planet formation.

We show that the H- and K-band\nemissions are coming mostly from the inner edge of the internal dust disk,\nlocated near 0.24 AU from the star, i.e., at the dust sublimation radius in our\nmodel.

However, because\nof/despite its simple appearance, there is much confusion surrounding its\nessence. Theorists have been asking questions for years: Is there a mechanism\nto explain this term? Is it really a constant or a variable? Moreover, it seems\nthat we have created a huge gulf separating the theories of inflation and\naccelerating expansion. Can we eliminate such an uncomfortable discontinuity?\n  Abstract In this paper, we will journey to see the growth of the universe\nfrom the very beginning of inflation. To simplify our discussion, we will\nbriefly \"turn off\" the effects of real and dark matter and shall use inflaton\n(a classical scalar field) dynamics with a time-varying inflaton potential\nV(phi,t) as the screen to watch this process. Relying on these conditions, we\npropose a non-traditional method of obtaining the solution of scale factor\nR(t), which is only dependent on phi'(t)^2, and discover that the term\nR\"(t)/R(t) will be a constant after kinetic inflaton phi'(t) is at rest. This\nresult can be regarded as the effective cosmological constant phenomenally.\nMoreover, we will also \"rebuild\" V(phi,t), realize its evolutionary process and\nthen, according to the relationship between V(phi,t) and phi'(t)^2, it will be\npossible to smoothly describe the whole evolution of the universe from the\nepoch of inflation. Therefore, the implications of our findings will mean that\nthe gulf between theories will disappear. Lastly, we will also see how the\nformula could provide a framework for solving the old and new cosmological\nconstant problems as well as much more besides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 19:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We consider\nthe strong observed evolution in the LF from z~6-10 in this context and\ndetermine whether it can be explained solely by the behavior of the HMF. From\nz~6-8, we find a residual change in the physics of galaxy formation\ncorresponding to a ~0.5 dex increase in the average luminosity of a halo of\nfixed mass. On the other hand, our analysis of recent LF measurements at z~10\nshows that the paucity of detected galaxies is consistent with almost no change\nin the average luminosity at fixed halo mass from z~8. The LF slope also\nconstrains the variation about this mean such that the luminosity of galaxies\nhosted by halos of the same mass are all within about an order-of-magnitude of\neach other. We show that these results are well-described by a simple model of\ngalaxy formation in which cold-flow accretion is balanced by star formation and\nmomentum-driven outflows. If galaxy formation proceeds in halos with masses\ndown to 10^8 Msun, then such a model predicts that LBGs at z~10 should be able\nto maintain an ionized intergalactic medium as long as the ratio of the\nclumping factor to the ionizing escape fraction is C/f_esc < 10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 22:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 20:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between\nstellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a\nnovel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong\nconstraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation (SHMR) from z=0.2 to z=1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass\nscales as Mh M*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with\nredshift to z=1. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh/M*, varies from low\nto high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh/M*~27 at M*=4.5x10^10 Msun and\nMh=1.2x10^12 Msun. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation\nbecause it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the\ncentral galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this\nminimum in terms of the \"pivot stellar mass\", M*piv, the \"pivot halo mass\",\nMhpiv, and the \"pivot ratio\", (Mh/M*)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a\nsingle data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for\nboth Mhpiv and M*piv. The pivot stellar mass decreases from\nM*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 Msun at z=0.88 to M*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 Msun at z=0.37.\nIntriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of Mhpiv leaves the pivot\nratio constant with redshift at (Mh/M*)piv~27. We use simple arguments to show\nhow this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may\nultimately depend on Mh/M* and not simply Mh, as is commonly assumed. We show\nthat simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the\nsites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in\nthe context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and AGN\nfeedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Since the number ~Npix^2 of terms in this sum exceeds\nthe number Npix of measurements, these ~Npix^2 terms cannot be statistically\nindependent.

Although the\nvariance of the estimators is known, the significance of a measurement of fnl\ndepends on knowledge of the full shape of its PDF. Here we use Monte Carlo\nrealizations of CMB maps to determine the PDF for two minimum-variance\nestimators: the standard estimator, constructed under the null hypothesis\n(fnl=0), and an improved estimator with a smaller variance for |fnl| > 0.

The spin\nvector of the inner halo experiences much more frequent flips than the halo as\na whole. Over their entire lifetimes (i.e. after a halo acquires half of its\nfinal mass), over 10% of halos experience a flip of at least 45 degrees in the\nspin of the entire halo and nearly 60 percent experience a flip this large in\nthe inner halo.

However, this is not\nthe only aspect of entanglement theory where local unitaries play a relevant\nrole. In the present work we show that the application of suitable local\nunitary operations defines a family of bipartite entanglement monotones,\ncollectively referred to as \"mirror entanglement\". They are constructed by\nfirst considering the (squared) Hilbert-Schmidt distance of the state from the\nset of states obtained by applying to it a given local unitary. To the action\nof each different local unitary there corresponds a different distance. We then\nminimize these distances over the sets of local unitaries with different\nspectra, obtaining an entire family of different entanglement monotones.

We analyze in\ndetail the properties of one particularly relevant member of the family, the\n\"stellar mirror entanglement\" associated to traceless local unitaries with\nnondegenerate spectrum and equispaced eigenvalues in the complex plane.

The\nreconstructed 1-D projection images reveal that the star appears differently in\nthe blue wing, line center, and red wing of the individual CO lines. The 1-D\nprojection images in the blue wing and line center show a pronounced,\nasymmetrically extended component up to ~1.3 stellar radii, while those in the\nred wing do not show such a component. The observed 1-D projection images in\nthe lines can be reasonably explained by a model in which the CO gas within a\nregion more than half as large as the stellar size is moving slightly outward\nwith 0--5 km s^-1, while the gas in the remaining region is infalling fast with\n20--30 km s^-1. A comparison between the CO line AMBER data taken in 2008 and\n2009 shows a significant time variation in the dynamics of the CO line-forming\nregion in the photosphere and the outer atmosphere. In contrast to the line\ndata, the reconstructed 1-D projection images in the continuum show only a\nslight deviation from a uniform disk or limb-darkened disk. We derive a\nuniform-disk diameter of 42.05 +/- 0.05 mas and a power-law-type limb-darkened\ndisk diameter of 42.49 +/- 0.06 mas and a limb-darkening parameter of (9.7 +/-\n0.5) x 10^{-2}. This latter angular diameter leads to an effective temperature\nof 3690 +/- 54 K for the continuum-forming layer. These diameters confirm that\nthe near-IR size of Betelgeuse was nearly constant over the last 18 years, in\nmarked contrast to the recently reported noticeable decrease in the mid-IR\nsize. The continuum data taken in 2008 and 2009 reveal no or only marginal time\nvariations, much smaller than the maximum variation predicted by the current\n3-D convection simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 20:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In addition to the orbital decay and circularization, we show\nthat the final configuration of the system is affected by the shrink of the\ninner orbit. Our second approach consist in the analysis of the stationary\nsolutions of mean equations of motion based on a Hamiltonian formalism. We\nconsider the case of a hot super-Earth planet with a more massive outer\ncompanion. As a real example, the CoRoT-7 system is analyzed solving the exact\nand mean equations of motion. The star-planet tidal interaction produces\norbital decay and circularization of the orbit of CoRoT-7b.

A curve in the\nspace of eccentricities can be constructed through the computation of\nstationary solutions of mean equations including dissipation. The application\nto CoRoT-7 system shows that the stationary curve agrees with the result of\nnumerical simulations of exact equations.

Reversible-jump\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) is an extremely powerful technique for\nperforming Bayesian model selection, but it suffers from a fundamental\ndifficulty: it requires jumps between model parameter spaces, but cannot\nefficiently explore both parameter spaces at once. Thus, a naive jump between\nparameter spaces is unlikely to be accepted in the MCMC algorithm and\nconvergence is correspondingly slow. Here we demonstrate an interpolation\ntechnique that uses samples from single-model MCMCs to propose inter-model\njumps from an approximation to the single-model posterior of the target\nparameter space. The interpolation technique, based on a kD-tree data\nstructure, is adaptive and efficient in modest dimensionality. We show that our\ntechnique leads to improved convergence over naive jumps in an RJMCMC, and\ncompare it to other proposals in the literature to improve the convergence of\nRJMCMCs.

Uniformly high throughput and low cross-talk\nare essential for imaging faint astronomical targets with sufficient resolution\nto disentangle the dynamical structure.

In particular, the position\nangle (PA) swings of many MSPs deviate from the S-shape predicted by the\nrotating vector model, even after relativistic aberration is accounted for,\nindicating that they have non-dipolar magnetic geometries, likely due to a\nhistory of accretion. Stokes tomography uses phase portraits of the Stokes\nparameters as a diagnostic tool to infer a pulsar's magnetic geometry and\norientation. This paper applies Stokes tomography to MSPs, generalizing the\ntechnique to handle interpulse emission. We present an atlas of look-up tables\nfor the Stokes phase portraits and PA swings of MSPs with current-modified\ndipole fields, filled core and hollow cone beams, and two empirical linear\npolarization models. We compare our look-up tables to data from 15 MSPs and\nfind that the Stokes phase portraits for a current-modified dipole\napproximately match several MSPs whose PA swings are flat or irregular and\ncannot be reconciled with the standard axisymmetric rotating vector model.

To mimic this process ex vivo, efforts have been\nmade to seed scaffolds with vascular and other cell types in the presence of\ngrowth factors and under pulsatile flow conditions. However, the resulting\nbioreactors lack information on shear stress and flow distributions within the\nscaffold. Consequently, it is difficult to interpret the effects of shear\nstress on cell function. Such knowledge would enable researchers to improve\nupon cell culture protocols. Recent work has focused on optimizing the\nmicrostructural parameters of the scaffold to fine tune the shear stress. In\nthis study, we have adopted a different approach whereby flows are redirected\nthroughout the bioreactor along channels patterned in the porous scaffold to\nyield shear stress distributions that are optimized for uniformity centered on\na target value. A topology optimization algorithm coupled to computational\nfluid dynamics simulations was devised to this end.

I explain a methodology to\nperform model-indepedent separate measurements of the three CP, T and CPT\nsymmetry violations for transitions involving the decay of the neutral meson\nsystems in B- and {\\Phi}-factories. It makes use of the quantum-mechanical\nentanglement only, for which the individual state of each neutral meson is not\ndefined before the decay of its orthogonal partner. The final proof of the\nindependence of the three asymmetries is that no other theoretical ingredient\nis involved and that the event sample corresponding to each case is different\nfrom the other two. The experimental analysis for the measurements of these\nthree asymmetries as function of the time interval {\\Delta}t > 0 between the\nfirst and second decays is discussed, as well as the significance of the\nexpected results. In particular, one may advance a first observation of true,\ndirect, evidence of Time-Reserval-Violation in B-factories by many standard\ndeviations from zero, without any reference to, and independent of,\nCP-Violation. In some quantum gravity framework the CPT-transformation is\nill-defined, so there is a resulting loss of particle-antiparticle identity.\nThis mechanism induces a breaking of the EPR correlation in the entanglement\nimposed by Bose statistics to the neutral meson system, the so-called\n{\\omega}-effect. I present results and prospects for the {\\omega}-parameter in\nthe correlated neutral meson-antimeson states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2011 11:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Such a model may be of\ninterest for node cooperation in the framework of cognition, i.e.,\ncollaborative signal transmission involving cognitive and non-cognitive radios.\nWe study the capacity of this communication model. One principal problem is\ncaused by the relay's not knowing the channel state. For the discrete\nmemoryless (DM) model, we establish two lower bounds and an upper bound on\nchannel capacity. The first lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme in which\nthe source describes the state of the channel to the relay and destination,\nwhich then exploit the gained description for a better communication of the\nsource's information message. The coding scheme for the second lower bound\nremedies the relay's not knowing the states of the channel by first computing,\nat the source, the appropriate input that the relay would send had the relay\nknown the states of the channel, and then transmitting this appropriate input\nto the relay. The relay simply guesses the sent input and sends it in the next\nblock. The upper bound is non trivial and it accounts for not knowing the state\nat the relay and destination. For the general Gaussian model, we derive lower\nbounds on the channel capacity by exploiting ideas in the spirit of those we\nuse for the DM model; and we show that these bounds are optimal for small and\nlarge noise at the relay irrespective to the strength of the interference.\nFurthermore, we also consider a special case model in which the source input\nhas two components one of which is independent of the state. We establish a\nbetter upper bound for both DM and Gaussian cases and we also characterize the\ncapacity in a number of special cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2011 11:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

We find exact non-linear time-dependent\nsplit-monopole structure of magnetosphere driven by spinning and collapsing NS\nin Schwarzschild geometry. Based on this solution, we argue that the collapse\nof a NS into the BH happens smoothly, without natural formation of current\nsheets or other dissipative structures on the open field lines and, thus, does\nnot allow the magnetic field to become disconnected from the star and escape to\ninfinity. Thus, as long as an isolated Kerr BH can produce plasma and currents,\nit does not lose its open magnetic field lines, its magnetospheric structure\nevolved towards a split monopole and the BH spins down electromagnetically. The\n\"no hair theorem\", which assumes that the outside medium is a vacuum, is not\napplicable in this case: highly conducting plasma introduces a topological\nconstraint forbidding the disconnection of the magnetic field lines from the\nBH. Eventually, a single random large scale spontaneous reconnection event will\nlead to magnetic field release, shutting down the electromagnetic BH engine\nforever.

At z ~ 1 we observe a reversal of the relation between star\nformation rate and local density, confirming the results based on Spitzer 24 um\ndata. However, due to the high accuracy provided by PACS in measuring the star\nformation rate also for AGN hosts, we identify in this class of objects the\ncause for the reversal of the density-SFR relation. Indeed, AGN hosts favor\nhigh stellar masses, dense regions and high star formation rates. Without the\nAGN contribution the relation flattens consistently with respect to the local\nanalog in the same range of star formation rates. As in the local universe, the\nspecific star formation rate anti-correlates with the density. This is due to\nmass segregation both at high and low redshift. The contribution of AGN hosts\ndoes not affect this anti-correlation, since AGN hosts exhibit the same\nspecific star formation rate as star forming galaxies at the same mass.

However, we urge\ncaution in over-interpreting the spin-jet power correlations, particularly\ngiven the strong dependence of our result on the (highly uncertain) assumed\npower law index of the luminosity correlations. We discuss the results in the\nframework of current models for jet formation in black holes and young stellar\nobjects and speculate on possible different jet production mechanisms for\nneutron stars depending on the accretion mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2011 14:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
