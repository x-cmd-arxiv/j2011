The relay observes a linear combination of the source signals and\nbroadcasts a common message to the two destinations, through a perfect link of\nfixed limited rate $R_0$ bits per channel use. The out-of-band nature of the\nrelay is reflected by the fact that the common relay message does not interfere\nwith the received signal at the two destinations. A general achievable rate is\nestablished, along with upper bounds on the capacity region for the Gaussian\ncase. For $R_0$ values below a certain threshold, which depends on channel\nparameters, the capacity region of this channel is determined in this paper to\nwithin a constant gap of $\\Delta=1.95$ bits. We identify interference regimes\nwhere a two-for-one gain in achievable rates is possible for every bit relayed,\nup to a constant approximation error. Instrumental to these results is a\ncarefully-designed quantize-and-forward type of relay strategy along with a\njoint decoding scheme employed at destination ends.

Comparison with the energy per particle in isospin symmetric or\nasymmetric unpolarized nuclear matter shows no evidence for a phase transition\nto a spin ordered state, neither ferromagnetic nor antiferromagnetic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2011 23:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-04"}

Given\nthe initial existence of a small mass <10^{-4} msun near the progenitor with a\ncircularization radius ~10^{10}-10^{11} cm, an unavoidable consequence will be\nthe formation of an \"external disk\" whose outer edge continually moves to\nlarger radii due to angular momentum transport and lack of a confining torque.\nFor long GRBs, if the mass distribution in the initial fall-back disk traces\nthe progenitor envelope, then a radius ~10^{11} cm gives a time scale ~10^4 s\nfor the X-ray plateau. For late times t>10^7 s a steepening due to a cooling\nfront in the disk may have observational support in GRB 060729. For short GRBs,\none expects most of the mass initially to lie at small radii <10^8 cm; however\nthe presence of even a trace amount ~10^{-9} msun of high angular momentum\nmaterial can give a brief plateau in the light curve. By studying the plateaus\nin the X-ray decay of GRBs, which can last up to ~10^4 s after the prompt\nemission, Dainotti et al. find an apparent inverse relation between the X-ray\nluminosity at the end of the plateau and the duration of the plateau.

We first consider a generalized coalition\nstructure consisting of multiple providers with many assisting peers, where\npeers assist providers to reduce the operational cost in content distribution.\nTo distribute the profit from cost reduction to players (i.e., providers and\npeers), we then establish a generalized formula for individual payoffs when a\n\"Shapley-like\" payoff mechanism is adopted. We show that the grand coalition is\nunstable, even when the operational cost functions are concave, which is in\nsharp contrast to the recently studied case of a single provider where the\ngrand coalition is stable. We also show that irrespective of stability of the\ngrand coalition, there always exist coalition structures which are not\nconvergent to the grand coalition under a dynamic among coalition structures.\nOur results give us an incontestable fact that a provider does not tend to\ncooperate with other providers in peer-assisted services, and be separated from\nthem. Three facets of the noncooperative (selfish) providers are illustrated;\n(i) underpaid peers, (ii) service monopoly, and (iii) oscillatory coalition\nstructure.

Previous solutions of this approach are\nlimited in their tacit assumption of single-level trust on data miners.\n  In this work, we relax this assumption and expand the scope of\nperturbation-based PPDM to Multi-Level Trust (MLT-PPDM). In our setting, the\nmore trusted a data miner is, the less perturbed copy of the data it can\naccess. Under this setting, a malicious data miner may have access to\ndifferently perturbed copies of the same data through various means, and may\ncombine these diverse copies to jointly infer additional information about the\noriginal data that the data owner does not intend to release. Preventing such\n\\emph{diversity attacks} is the key challenge of providing MLT-PPDM services.\nWe address this challenge by properly correlating perturbation across copies at\ndifferent trust levels.

The\nfirst concerns the question of the holomorphy of the coupling, and related to\nthis the possible definition of an exact (NSVZ) beta function. The second\nconcerns instantons in pure gluodynamics, which appear to give sensible, exact\nresults for certain correlation functions, which nonetheless differ from those\nobtained using systematic weak coupling expansions. For the first question, we\nextend an earlier proposal of Arkani-Hamed and Murayama, showing that if their\nregulated action is written suitably, the holomorphy of the couplings is\nmanifest, and it is easy to determine the renormalization scheme for which the\nNSVZ formula holds. This scheme, however, is seen to be one of an infinite\nclass of schemes, each leading to an exact beta function; the NSVZ scheme,\nwhile simple, is not selected by any compelling physical consideration. For the\nsecond question, we explain why the instanton computation in the pure\nsupersymmetric gauge theory is not reliable, even at short distances. The\nsemiclassical expansion about the instanton is purely formal; if infrared\ndivergences appear, they spoil arguments based on holomorphy. We demonstrate\nthat infrared divergences do not occur in the perturbation expansion about the\ninstanton, but explain that there is no reason to think this captures all\ncontributions from the sector with unit topological charge. That one expects\nadditional contributions is illustrated by dilute gas corrections. These are\ninfrared divergent, and so difficult to define, but if non-zero give order one,\nholomorphic, corrections to the leading result. Exploiting an earlier analysis\nof Davies et al, we demonstrate that in the theory compactified on a circle of\nradius beta, due to infrared effects, finite contributions indeed arise which\nare not visible in the formal limit that beta goes to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 04:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 00:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The corrected Sr abundances and previously obtained\nNLTE Ba abundances are compared to the predictions of several hypothetical\nformation processes for the lighter neutron-capture elements.

Methods: Using high resolution UVES\nspectra, we measure beryllium abundances of 26 stars that host planets and 1\n\"single\" star mainly using the lambda 3131.065 A Be II line, by fitting\nsynthetic spectra to the observational data. We also compile beryllium\nabundance measurements of 44 stars hosting planets and 29 \"single\" stars from\nthe literature, resulting in a final sample of 100 objects. Results: We confirm\nthat the beryllium content is roughly the same in stars hosting planets and in\n\"single\" stars at temperatures Teff > 5700K. The sample is still small for Teff\n< 5500K, but it seems that the scatter in Be abundances of dwarf stars is\nslightly higher at these cooler temperatures. Conclusions: We search for\ndistinctive characteristics of planet hosts through correlations of Be\nabundance versus Li abundance, age, metallicity and oxygen abundance. These\ncould provide some insight in the formation and evolution of planetary systems,\nbut we did not find any clear correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 09:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 21:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The study of the snow line is an important topic in several domains\nof astrophysics, and particularly for the evolution of proto-stellar\nenvironments and the formation of planets. Aims. The formation of the first\nlayer of ice on carbon grains requires low temperatures compared to the\ntemperature of evaporation (T > 100 K). This asymmetry generates a zone in\nwhich bare and icy dust grains coexist. Methods. We use Monte-Carlo simulations\nto describe the formation time scales of ice mantles on bare grains in\nprotostellar disks and massive protostars environments. Then we analytically\ndescribe these two systems in terms of grain populations subject to infall and\nturbulence, and assume steady-state. Results. Our results show that there is an\nextended region beyond the snow line where icy and bare grains can coexist, in\nboth proto-planetary disks and massive protostars. This zone is not negligible\ncompared to the total size of the objects: on the order of 0.4 AU for\nproto-planetary disks and 5400 AU for high-mass protostars. Times to reach the\nsteady-state are respectively es- timated from 10^2 to 10^5 yr. Conclusions.\nThe presence of a zone, a so-called snow border, in which bare and icy grains\nco- exist can have a major impact on our knowledge of protostellar\nenvironments. From a theoretical point of view, the progression of icy grains\nto bare grains as the temperature increases, could be a realistic way to model\nhot cores and hot corinos. Also, in this zone, the formation of planetesimals\nwill require the coagulation of bare and icy grains. Observationally, this zone\nallows high abundances of gas phase species at large scales, for massive\nprotostars particularly, even at low temperatures (down to 50 K).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 11:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Heavy atoms ($Z_N >$ few) in the interstellar\nmedium which start the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) are never fully\nionized at the moment of injection. The ionization occurs during the\nacceleration process, when atoms already move relativistically. For typical\nenvironment around SNRs the photo-ionization due to the background galactic\nradiation dominates over Coulomb collisions. The main consequence of ionization\nis the reduction of the maximum energy which ions can achieve with respect to\nthe standard result of the DSA. In fact the photo-ionization has a timescale\ncomparable to the beginning of the Sedov-Taylor phase, hence the maximum energy\nis no more proportional to the nuclear charge, as predicted by standard DSA,\nbut rather to the effective ions' charge during the acceleration process, which\nis smaller than the total nuclear charge $Z_N$. This result can have a direct\nconsequence in the prediction of the knee structure of the cosmic ray spectrum.\nMoreover the acceleration of ultra-heavy elements beyond the Iron's maximum\nenergy is very hard to achieve making unlikely their possible contribution to\nthe cosmic ray spectrum in the transition region between Galactic and\nextragalactic component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 13:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

Infrared Faint Radio Sources (IFRS) are extragalactic emitters\nclearly detected at radio wavelengths but barely detected or undetected at\noptical and infrared wavelengths, with 5 sigma sensitivities as low as 1 uJy.\nAims. Recent SED-modelling and analysis of their radio properties shows that\nIFRS are consistent with a population of (potentially extremely obscured)\nhigh-redshift AGN at 3<z<6. We demonstrate some astrophysical implications of\nthis population and compare them to predictions from models of galaxy evolution\nand structure formation.\n  Methods. We compiled a list of IFRS from four deep extragalactic surveys and\nextrapolated the IFRS number density to a survey-independent value of (30.8 +-\n15.0) per square degree. We computed the IFRS contribution to the total number\nof AGN in the Universe to account for the Cosmic X-ray Background. By\nestimating the black hole mass contained in IFRS, we present conclusions for\nthe SMBH mass density in the early universe and compare it to relevant\nsimulations of structure formation after the Big Bang.\n  Results. The number density of AGN derived from the IFRS density was found to\nbe about 310 deg^-2, which is equivalent to a SMBH mass density of the order of\n10^3 M_sun Mpc^-3 in the redshift range 3<z<6. This produces an X-ray flux of 9\n10^-16 W m^-2 deg^-2 in the 0.5-2.0 keV band and 3 10^-15 W m^-2 deg^-2 in the\n2.0-10 keV band, in agreement with the missing unresolved components of the\nCosmic X-ray Background.

In\nthis regard, the security of individual nodes depend not only on their own\nefforts, but also on the efforts and underlying connectivity structure of\nneighboring network nodes. By the term 'effort', we imply the amount of\ninvestments made by a user in security mechanisms like antivirus softwares,\nfirewalls, etc., to improve its security. However, often due to the large\nmagnitude of such networks, it is not always possible for nodes to have\ncomplete effort and connectivity structure information about all their neighbor\nnodes. Added to this is the fact that in many applications, the Internet users\nare selfish and are not willing to co-operate with other users on sharing\neffort information.

To get global information (independent of the\nstarting node) about the transport efficiency, we average the return\nprobability over all nodes of the network. We apply the decay rate and the\nasymptotic value of the average of the return probability to evaluate the\ntransport efficiency. Our numerical results prove that the existence of the\nsymmetry in the underlying networks makes quantum transport less efficient than\nthe classical one. In addition, we find that the increasing of the symmetry of\nthese networks decreases the efficiency of quantum transport on them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 15:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

In this paper, these changes to the density\nand flow of a collisional impurity species are calculated for the case when the\nmain ions are in the plateau regime. In this regime it is found that the\nimpurity density can be higher at either the inboard or outboard side. This\nfinding differs from earlier results for banana- or Pfirsch-Schl\\\"uter-regime\nmain ions, in which case the impurity density is always higher at the inboard\nside in the absence of rotation. Finally, the modifications to the impurity\nflow are also given for the other regimes of main-ion collisionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 15:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Their iterative threshold increases with their average degree, or\nwith the size of the coupling window in randomized constructions. In the later\ncase, as the window size grows, the Belief Propagation (BP) threshold attains\nthe maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. In this\ncontribution we show that a similar phenomenon happens for the growth rate of\ncoupled ensembles. Loosely speaking, we observe that as the coupling strength\ngrows, the growth rate of the coupled ensemble comes close to the concave hull\nof the underlying ensemble's growth rate. For ensembles randomly coupled across\na window the growth rate actually tends to the concave hull of the underlying\none as the window size increases. Our observations are supported by the\ncalculations of the combinatorial growth rate, and that of the growth rate\nderived from the replica method. The observed concavity is a general feature of\ncoupled mean field graphical models and is already present at the level of\ncoupled Curie-Weiss models. There, the canonical free energy of the coupled\nsystem tends to the concave hull of the underlying one. As we explain, the\nbehavior of the growth rate of coupled ensembles is exactly analogous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 15:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
