Hybrid methods aim at (i)\napproximately solving the adjoint transport equation with a deterministic\nmethod; and (ii) use the solution to construct an unbiased MC sampling\nalgorithm with low variance. The problem with this approach is that both steps\ncan be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we simplify steps (i) and (ii)\nby calculating only parts of the adjoint solution. More specifically, in a\ngeometry with limited volume scattering and complicated reflection at the\nboundary, we consider the situation where the adjoint solution \"neglects\"\nvolume scattering, whereby significantly reducing the degrees of freedom in\nsteps (i) and (ii). A main application for such a geometry is in remote sensing\nof the environment using physics-based signal models. Volume scattering is then\nincorporated using an analog sampling algorithm (or more precisely a simple\nmodification of analog sampling called a heuristic sampling algorithm) in order\nto obtain unbiased estimators. In geometries with weak volume scattering (with\na domain of interest of size comparable to the transport mean free path), we\ndemonstrate numerically significant variance reductions and speed-ups (figures\nof merit).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 17:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

This\narticle presents a general mathematical framework to efficiently allocate the\navailable computational resources to process the parts of the input that are\nrelevant to solve a given perceptual problem. By this we mean to find the\nhypothesis H (i.e., the state of the world) that maximizes a function L(H),\nrepresenting how well each hypothesis \"explains\" the input. Given the large\nbandwidth of the sensory input, fully evaluating L(H) for each hypothesis H is\ncomputationally infeasible (e.g., because it would imply checking a large\nnumber of pixels). To address this problem we propose a mathematical framework\nwith two key ingredients. The first one is a Bounding Mechanism (BM) to compute\nlower and upper bounds of L(H), for a given computational budget. These bounds\nare much cheaper to compute than L(H) itself, can be refined at any time by\nincreasing the budget allocated to a hypothesis, and are frequently enough to\ndiscard a hypothesis. To compute these bounds, we develop a novel theory of\nshapes and shape priors. The second ingredient is a Focus of Attention\nMechanism (FoAM) to select which hypothesis' bounds should be refined next,\nwith the goal of discarding non-optimal hypotheses with the least amount of\ncomputation. The proposed framework: 1) is very efficient since most hypotheses\nare discarded with minimal computation; 2) is parallelizable; 3) is guaranteed\nto find the globally optimal hypothesis; and 4) its running time depends on the\nproblem at hand, not on the bandwidth of the input.

We look here into the growth of\nlarge-scale structure in the models. The Szekeres models are exact solutions to\nEinstein's equations that were originally derived with no symmetries. We use a\nformulation of the models that is due to Goode and Wainwright, who considered\nthe models as exact perturbations of an FLRW background. Using the Raychaudhuri\nequation, we write for the two classes of the models, exact growth equations in\nterms of the under/overdensity and measurable cosmological parameters. The new\nequations in the overdensity split into two informative parts. The first part,\nwhile exact, is identical to the growth equation in the usual linearly\nperturbed FLRW models, while the second part constitutes exact non-linear\nperturbations. We integrate numerically the full exact growth rate equations\nfor the flat and curved cases. We find that for the matter-dominated era, the\nSzekeres growth rate is up to a factor of three to five stronger than the usual\nlinearly perturbed FLRW cases, reflecting the effect of exact Szekeres\nnon-linear perturbations.

Flares were found using a flare-finding algorithm designed\nto search the 6-10 keV count-rate when RHESSI's full sensitivity was available\nin order to find the smallest events (Christe et al., 2008). Between March 2002\nand March 2007, a total of 25,006 events were found. Source locations were\ndetermined in the 4-10 keV, 10-15 keV, and 15-30 keV energy ranges for each\nevent. In order to extract the height distribution from the observed projected\nsource positions, a forward-fit model was developed with an assumed source\nheight distribution where height is measured from the photosphere. We find that\nthe best flare height distribution is given by g(h) \\propto exp(-h/{\\lambda})\nwhere {\\lambda} = 6.1\\pm0.3 Mm is the scale height. A power-law height\ndistribution with a negative power-law index, {\\gamma} = 3.1 \\pm 0.1 is also\nconsistent with the data. Interpreted as thermal loop top sources, these\nheights are compared to loops generated by a potential field model (PFSS). The\nmeasured flare heights distribution are found to be much steeper than the\npotential field loop height distribution which may be a signature of the flare\nenergization process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 21:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We want to estimate the behaviour of the\nphysical system between times $t_0$ and $t_1$.\n  An integral curve of an arbitrary vector field $X$ is said to be {\\em\nfeasible} when it interpolates the measurements. When $X$ is critical for $L^2$\ndistance to ${\\cal A}$, the feasible curve is called a {\\em conditional\nextremum}.

The algorithm is based on\nGloptipoly 3, a public-domain Matlab package solving nonconvex polynomial\noptimization problems with the help of convex semidefinite programming\n(optimization over linear matrix inequalities, or LMIs). We illustrate how the\nalgorithm can be used to design fixed-order controllers for linear systems,\nfollowing a polynomial approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 07:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 20:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

With one processor core of Intel Core i7-2600\nprocessor (8 MB cache and 3.40 GHz) based on Sandy Bridge micro-architecture,\nwe implemented a fourth-order Hermite scheme with individual timestep scheme\n(Makino and Aarseth, 1992), and achieved the performance of 20 giga floating\npoint number operations per second (GFLOPS) for double-precision accuracy,\nwhich is two times and five times higher than that of the previously developed\ncode implemented with the SSE instructions (Nitadori et al., 2006b), and that\nof a code implemented without any explicit use of SIMD instructions with the\nsame processor core, respectively. We have parallelized the code by using\nso-called NINJA scheme (Nitadori et al., 2006a), and achieved 90 GFLOPS for a\nsystem containing more than N = 8192 particles with 8 MPI processes on four\ncores. We expect to achieve about 10 tera FLOPS (TFLOPS) for a self-gravitating\ncollisional system with N 105 on massively parallel systems with at most 800\ncores with Sandy Bridge micro-architecture. This performance will be comparable\nto that of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) cluster systems, such as the one with\nabout 200 Tesla C1070 GPUs (Spurzem et al., 2010).

The 3D velocities\nand Mach numbers derived from simulations can be used to derive simple Mach\ncone geometries for Virgo spiral galaxies. We search for indications of hot gas\nwithin Mach cones in X-ray observations of selected Virgo Cluster spiral\ngalaxies (NGC 4569, NGC 4388, and NGC 4501). We find extraplanar diffuse X-ray\nemission in all galaxies. Based on the 3D velocity vectors from dynamical\nmodelling a simple Mach cone is fitted to the triangular shape of NGC 4569's\ndiffuse X-ray emission. Assuming that all extraplanar diffuse X-ray emission\nhas to be located inside the Mach cone, we also fit Mach cones to NGC 4388's\nand NGC 4501's extraplanar X-ray emission. For NGC 4569 it is hard to reconcile\nthe derived Mach cone opening angle with a Mach number based on the sound speed\nalone. Instead, a Mach number involving the Alfv\\'enic speed seems to be more\nappropriate, yielding a magnetic field strength of $\\sim 3$-6 $\\mu$G for a\nintracluster medium density of $n \\sim 10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$. Whereas the\ntemperature of the hot component of NGC 4569's X-ray halo (0.5 keV) is at the\nhigh end but typical for a galactic outflow, the temperature of the hot gas\ntails of NGC 4388 and NGC 4501 are significantly hotter (0.7-0.9 keV). In NGC\n4569 we find direct evidence for a Mach cone which is filled with hot gas from\na galactic superwind. We suggest that the high gas temperatures in the X-ray\ntails of NGC 4388 and NGC 4501 are due to the mixing of the stripped ISM into\nthe hot intracluster medium of the Virgo cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 10:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The timing solutions allow us to infer neutron\nstar characteristics such as energy-loss rate, magnetic field strength and\nevolutionary timescales, as well as facilitating multi-wavelength followup by\nproviding accurate astrometry. All of this enables us to consider the question\nof whether or not RRATs are in any way special, i.e. a distinct and separate\npopulation of neutron stars, as has been previously suggested. We see no reason\nto consider 'RRAT' as anything other than a detection label, the subject of a\nselection effect in the parameter space searched. However, single-pulse\nsearches can be utilised to great effect to identify pulsars difficult, or\nimpossible, to find by other means, in particular those with long-periods (half\nof the PMPS RRATs have periods greater than 4 seconds), high-magnetic field\nstrengths ($B\\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G) and pulsars approaching the 'death valley'.\nThe detailed nulling properties of such pulsars are unknown but the mounting\nevidence suggests a broad range of behaviour in the pulsar population.

The\nmain idea is to define the relative spatial arrangement of local symmetry axes\nand their metric properties in a shape centered coordinate frame. The resulting\ndescriptions are invariant to scale, rotation, small changes in viewpoint and\narticulations. Symmetry points are extracted from a surface whose level curves\nroughly mimic the motion by curvature. By increasing the amount of smoothing on\nthe evolving curve, only those symmetry axes that correspond to the most\nprominent parts of a shape are extracted.

An MkNN query continuously returns the k nearest data objects for a\nmoving user (query point). Simply updating a user's imprecise location such as\na region instead of the exact position to a location-based service provider\n(LSP) cannot ensure privacy of the user for an MkNN query: continuous\ndisclosure of regions enables the LSP to follow a user's trajectory. We\nidentify the problem of trajectory privacy that arises from the overlap of\nconsecutive regions while requesting an MkNN query and provide the first\nsolution to this problem. Our approach allows a user to specify the confidence\nlevel that represents a bound of how much more the user may need to travel than\nthe actual kth nearest data object. By hiding a user's required confidence\nlevel and the required number of nearest data objects from an LSP, we develop a\ntechnique to prevent the LSP from tracking the user's trajectory for MkNN\nqueries.

Spinfoams define quantum space-time structures describing the\nevolution in time of the spin network states for quantum geometry derived from\nLoop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The construction of this covariant approach is\nbased on the formulation of General Relativity as a topological theory plus the\nso-called simplicity constraints which introduce local degrees of freedom. The\nsimplicity constraints are essential in turning the non-physical topological\ntheory into 4d gravity. In this PhD manuscript, an original way to impose the\nsimplicity constraints in 4d Euclidean gravity using harmonic oscillators is\nproposed and new coherent states, solutions of the constraints, are given.\nMoreover, a consistent spinfoam model for quantum gravity has to be connected\nto LQG and must have the right semi-classical limit. An explicit map between\nthe spin network states of LQG and the boundary states of spinfoam models is\ngiven connecting the canonical and the covariant approaches. Finally, new\ntechniques to compute semiclassical asymptotic expressions for the transition\namplitudes of 3d quantum gravity and to extract semi-classical information from\na spinfoam model are introduced. Explicit computations based on approximation\nmethods and on the use of recurrence relations on spinfoam amplitudes have been\nperformed. The results are relevant to derive quantum corrections to the\ndynamics of the gravitational field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 13:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We use residual analyses to reveal systematic nonlinearity\nacross voxels not taken into account by previous models. We then show how a\nsparse nonparametric method [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 71 (2009b) 1009-1030]\ncan be used together with correlation screening to estimate nonlinear encoding\nmodels effectively. Our approach produces encoding models that predict about\n25% more accurately than models estimated using other methods [Nature 452\n(2008a) 352--355]. The estimated nonlinearity impacts the inferred properties\nof individual voxels, and it has a plausible biological interpretation. One\nbenefit of quantitative encoding models is that estimated models can be used to\ndecode brain activity, in order to identify which specific image was seen by an\nobserver. Encoding models estimated by our approach also improve such image\nidentification by about 12% when the correct image is one of 11,500 possible\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 15:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 09:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Our results show a dramatic decrease in the\nnumber of tile types needed to assemble $n \\times n$ squares to\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ at temperature 1 for the most simple model which meets\na lower bound from Kolmogorov complexity, and $O(\\log\\log n)$ in a model in\nwhich tile aggregates must move together through obstacle free paths within the\nplane.
