For massless, \"AdS-filling\" Dp-brane\nembeddings at zero temperature, we find an infinite set of threshold values of\nthe chemical potential at which instabilities are triggered. The onset of\ninstability is always preceded by metastability of the zero density state. From\nthe onset values of the chemical potential, we infer that unstable directions\nfavour a homogeneous condensate of a bilinear made from fermion harmonics, or\nCooper pairing. We confirm this picture both numerically and analytically. The\nlinearized analysis showing the appearance of instabilities involves a charged\nscalar in global AdS space coupled to a (large) constant background gauge\npotential. The resulting frequency space correlator of the fermion bilinear at\nstrong coupling displays poles in the upper half plane.

Since effects of elasticity are taken into account, the dynamics at\nshort time scales is modified from that given by the Navier-Stokes equations,\nso that acausal problems intrinsic to relativistic Navier-Stokes fluids are\nsignificantly remedied. We in particular show that the wave equations for the\npropagation of disturbance around a hydrostatic equilibrium in Minkowski\nspacetime become symmetric hyperbolic for some range of parameters, so that the\nmodel is free of acausality problems. This observation suggests that the\nrelativistic viscoelastic model with such parameters can be regarded as a\ncausal completion of relativistic Navier-Stokes fluid mechanics. By adjusting\nparameters to various values, this theory can treat a wide variety of materials\nincluding elastic materials, Maxwell materials, Kelvin-Voigt materials, and (a\nnonlinearly generalized version of) simplified Israel-Stewart fluids, and thus\nwe expect the theory to be the most universal description of single-component\nrelativistic continuum materials.

This kind of\ncirculation follows from mean-field models of the angular momentum balance in\nthe solar convection zone. We show that it is possible for this types of\nmeridional circulation to construct kinematic dynamo models that resemble in\nsome aspects the sunspot magnetic activity cycle. The dynamo model includes\nturbulent sources of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field production, due to\nkinetic helicity and a combined effect due to Coriolis force and the\nlarge-scale current. In these models the toroidal magnetic field, which is\nresponsible for the sunspot production, is concentrated at the bottom of the\nconvection zone, and is transported to low-latitude regions by the meridional\nflow. The meridional component of the poloidal field is also concentrated at\nthe bottom of the convection zone while the radial component is concentrated in\nnear polar regions. There are some issues which, perhaps, are resulted from the\ngiven meridional circulation pattern and the distribution of the magnetic\ndiffusivity inside convection zone. In particular, in the near-equatorial\nregions the phase relations between the toroidal and poloidal components\ndisagree with observations.

Phenomenological theories of\nMHD turbulence describe the self-similar dynamics of turbulent fluctuations in\nthe inertial range of scales. Numerical simulations serve to guide and test\nthese theories. However, the computational power that is currently available\nrestricts the simulations to Reynolds numbers that are significantly smaller\nthan those in astrophysical settings. In order to increase computational\nefficiency and, therefore, probe a larger range of scales, one often takes into\naccount the fundamental anisotropy of field-guided MHD turbulence, with\ngradients being much slower in the field-parallel direction. The simulations\nare then optimised by employing the reduced MHD equations and relaxing the\nfield-parallel numerical resolution. In this work we explore a different\npossibility. We propose that there exist certain quantities that are remarkably\nstable with respect to the Reynolds number. As an illustration, we study the\nalignment angle between the magnetic and velocity fluctuations in MHD\nturbulence, measured as the ratio of two specially constructed structure\nfunctions. We find that the scaling of this ratio can be extended surprisingly\nwell into the regime of relatively low Reynolds number. However, the extended\nscaling becomes easily spoiled when the dissipation range in the simulations is\nunder-resolved.

We link directly this cross-ratio with Fay's trisecant\nidentity for the tau-function (equivalent to the KP hierarchy). By restriction\nto the image of the Krichever map, we use the Schwarzian to introduce the\nnotion of operator-valued projective structure on a compact Riemann surface:\nthis allows a deformation inside the Grassmannian (as it varies its complex\nstructure). Lastly, we use our identification of the Jacobian of the Riemann\nsurface in terms of extensions of the Burchnall-Chaundy C*-algebra (Part I) to\ndescribe the KP hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2011 22:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-11"}

Abridged. Many stars are members of binary systems. During early\nphases when the stars are surrounded by discs, the binary orbit and disc\nmidplane may be mutually inclined. The discs around T Tauri stars will become\nmildly warped and undergo solid body precession around the angular momentum\nvector of the binary system. It is unclear how planetesimals in such a disc\nwill evolve and affect planet formation. Aims. We investigate the dynamics of\nplanetesimals embedded in discs that are perturbed by a binary companion on a\ncircular, inclined orbit. We examine collisional velocities of the\nplanetesimals to determine when they can grow through accretion. We vary the\nbinary inclination, binary separation, D, disc mass, and planetesimal radius.\nOur standard model has D=60 AU, inclination=45 deg, and a disc mass equivalent\nto the MMSN. Methods. We use a 3D hydrodynamics code to model the disc.\nPlanetesimals are test particles which experience gas drag, the gravitational\nforce of the disc, the companion star gravity. Planetesimal orbit crossing\nevents are detected and used to estimate collisional velocities. Results. For\nbinary systems with modest inclination (25 deg), disc gravity prevents\nplanetesimal orbits from undergoing strong differential nodal precession (which\noccurs in absence of the disc), and forces planetesimals to precess with the\ndisc on average. For bodies of different size the orbit planes become modestly\nmutually inclined, leading to collisional velocities that inhibit growth. For\nlarger inclinations (45 degrees), the Kozai effect operates, leading to\ndestructively large relative velocities. Conclusions. Planet formation via\nplanetesimal accretion is difficult in an inclined binary system with\nparameters similar to those considered in this paper. For systems in which the\nKozai mechanism operates, the prospects for forming planets are very remote.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2011 23:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-11"}

Despite their\nspatial proximity to material surfaces, surface states have been largely\noverlooked in fundamental understanding of surface catalysis and potential\nreal-world applications, because of their vulnerability to local impurities or\ndefects. In contrast, the recently discovered three-dimensional topological\ninsulators (3DTI) have exceptionally robust metallic surface states that are\ntopologically protected against surface contamination and imperfection. The\nrobust topological surface state(s) (TSS) provides a perfect platform for\nexploiting novel physical phenomena and potential applications of surface\nstates in less stringent environments. Here we employ first-principles density\nfunctional theory to demonstrate that the TSS can play a vital and elegant role\nin facilitating surface reactions by serving as an effective electron bath. We\nuse CO oxidation on gold-covered Bi2Se3 as a prototype example, and first show\nthat the TSS is preserved when a stable ultrathin Au film is deposited onto a\nBi-terminated Bi2Se3 substrate. Furthermore, the TSS can significantly enhance\nthe adsorption energy of both CO and O2 molecules, by promoting different\ndirections of electron transfer. For CO, the TSS accepts electrons from the\nCO-Au system, thereby decreasing the undesirable occupation of the CO\nantibonding states. For O2, the TSS donates the needed electrons to promote the\nmolecule towards dissociative adsorption. The present study adds a new arena to\nthe technological potentials of 3DTI, and the central concept of TSS as an\nelectron bath as revealed here may lead to new design principles beyond the\nconventional d-band theory of heterogeneous catalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2011 01:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Secondly, we propose two techniques to tighten the\nunion bound on the error probability caused by the good region. The first\ntechnique is based on pair-wise error probabilities, which can be further\ntightened by employing the independence between the error events and certain\ncomponents of the received random vectors. The second technique is based on\ntriplet-wise error probabilities, which can be upper-bounded by proving that\nany three bipolar vectors form a non-obtuse triangle.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the intermediate stages - from planetesimals to planetary\nembryos/cores - of planet formation in such highly inclined cases. Our focus is\non the effects of gas drag on the planetesimals' orbital evolution, in\nparticular on the evolution of the planetesimals' semimajor axis distribution\nand their mutual relative velocities. We first demonstrate that a non-evolving\naxisymmetric disk model is a good approximation for studying the effects of gas\ndrag on a planetesimal in the highly inclined case ($30^\\circ <i_B<150^\\circ$).\nWe then find that gas drag plays a crucial role, and the results can be\ngenerally divided into two categories, i.e., the Kozai-on regime and the\nKozai-off regime, depending on the specific value of $i_B$. For both regimes, a\nrobust outcome over a wide range of parameters is that, planetesimals\nmigrate/jump inwards and pile up, leading to a severely truncated and dense\nplanetesimal disk around the primary. In this compact and dense disk, collision\nrates are high but relative velocities are low, providing conditions which are\nfavorable for planetesimal growth, and potentially allow for the subsequent\nformation of planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2011 03:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Each particle has a location and a\n\"level,\" but unlike earlier constructions, the levels change with time. In\nfact, death of a particle occurs only when the level of the particle crosses a\nspecified level $r$, or for the limiting models, hits infinity. For branching\nMarkov processes, at each time $t$, conditioned on the state of the process,\nthe levels are independent and uniformly distributed on $[0,r]$. For the\nlimiting measure-valued process, at each time $t$, the joint distribution of\nlocations and levels is conditionally Poisson distributed with mean measure\n$K(t)\\times\\varLambda$, where $\\varLambda$ denotes Lebesgue measure, and $K$ is\nthe desired measure-valued process.

This work presents a\ncomprehensive study of hole velocities in p-type UTB films of widths from 15nm\ndown to 3nm. Various transport and surface orientations are considered. The\natomistic sp3d5s*-spin-orbit-coupled tight-binding model is used for the\nelectronic structure, and a semiclassical ballistic model for the carrier\nvelocity calculation. We find that the carrier velocity is a strong function of\norientation and layer thickness. The (110) and (112) surfaces provide the\nhighest hole velocities, whereas the (100) surfaces the lowest velocities,\nalmost 30% lower than the best performers. Additionally, up to 35% velocity\nenhancements can be achieved as the thickness of the (110) or (112) surfaces is\nscaled down to 3nm. This originates from strong increase in the curvature of\nthe p-type UTB film subbands with confinement, unlike the case of n-type UTB\nchannels. The velocity behavior directly translates to ballistic on-current\ntrends, and correlates with trends in experimental mobility measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2011 08:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-11"}

Methods: We use the gas-grain code\nNautilus with an up-to-date gas-phase network to study the sensitivity of the\nmolecular oxygen abundance to the oxygen elemental abundance. We use the rate\ncoefficient for the reaction O + OH at 10 K recommended by the KIDA (KInetic\nDatabase for Astrochemistry) experts. Results: The updates of rate coefficients\nand branching ratios of the reactions of our gas-phase chemical network,\nespecially N + CN and H3+ + O, have changed the model sensitivity to the oxygen\nelemental abundance. In addition, the gas-phase abundances calculated with our\ngas-grain model are less sensitive to the elemental C/O ratio than those\ncomputed with a pure gas-phase model. The grain surface chemistry plays the\nrole of a buffer absorbing most of the extra carbon. Finally, to reproduce the\nlow abundance of molecular oxygen observed in dark clouds at all times, we need\nan oxygen elemental abundance smaller than 1.6E-4.

Using a canonical transformation of the quark\nand gluon fields, which Abelianises the Gauss law constraints to be\nimplemented, the corresponding unconstrained Hamiltonian and total angular\nmomentum are derived. In the same way as this reduces the colored spin-1 gluons\nto unconstrained colorless spin-0 and spin-2 gluons, it reduces the colored\nspin-1/2 quarks to unconstrained colorless spin-0 and spin-1 quarks. These\nhowever continue to satisfy anti-commutation relations and hence the\nPauli-exclusion principle. The obtained unconstrained Hamiltonian is then\nrewritten into a form, which separates the rotational from the scalar degrees\nof freedom. In this form the low-energy spectrum can be obtained with high\naccuracy. As an illustrative example, the spin-0 energy-spectrum of the\nquark-gluon system is calculated for massless quarks of one flavor.

In\nparticular, black-hole XRBs emit compact, steady radio jets when they are in\nthe so-called hard state, the jets become eruptive as the sources move toward\nthe soft state, disappear in the soft state, and re-appear when the sources\nreturn to the hard state. On the other hand, jets from neutron-star X-ray\nbinaries are typically weaker radio emitters than the black-hole ones at the\nsame X-ray luminosity and in some cases radio emission is detected in the soft\nstate. Significant phenomenology has been accumulated so far regarding the\nspectral states of neutron-star and black-hole XRBs, and there is general\nagreement about the type of the accretion disk around the compact object in the\nvarious spectral states. Our aim is to investigate whether the phenomenology\nregarding the X-ray emission on one hand and the jet appearance and\ndisappearance on the other can be put together in a consistent physical\npicture. It has been shown that the so-called Poynting-Robertson Cosmic Battery\n(PRCB) explains in a natural way the formation of magnetic fields in the disks\nof AGN and the ejection of jets. We investigate whether the PRCB can also\nexplain the formation, destruction, and variability of jets in XRBs. We find\nexcellent agreement between the conditions under which the PRCB is efficient\n(i.e., the type of the accretion disk) and the emission or destruction of the\nradio jet. The disk-jet connection in XRBs is explained in a natural way using\nthe PRCB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2011 13:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 15:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The\nRiemannian metric $g_F$ also behaves nicely under conformal or bilipshitz\ndeformation of the Finsler metric $F$. These properties makes it a powerful\ntool in Finsler geometry and we illustrate that by solving a number of named\nFinslerian geometric problems. We also generalize and give new and shorter\nproofs of a number of known results. In particular we answer a question of M.\nMatsumoto about local conformal mapping between two Minkowski spaces, we\ndescribe all possible conformal self maps and all self similarities on a\nFinsler manifold. We also classify all compact conformally flat Finsler\nmanifolds, solve a conjecture of S. Deng and Z.

Wang\nabout the maximal dimension of the isometry groups of Finsler manifolds to\nmanifolds of all dimensions.\n  Most proofs in this paper go along the following scheme: using the\ncorrespondence $F \\mapsto g_F$we reduce the Finslerian problem to a similar\nproblem for the Binet-Legendre metric, which is easier and is already solved in\nmost cases we consider. The solution of the Riemannian problem provides us with\nthe additional information that helps to solve the initial Finslerian problem.\n  Our methods apply even in the absence of the strong convexity assumption\nusually assumed in Finsler geometry.
