We investigate differential invariants, which define an induction\nprinciple for differential equations and which can be checked for invariance\nalong a differential equation just by using their differential structure,\nwithout having to solve them. We study the structural properties of\ndifferential invariants. To analyze trade-offs for proof search complexity, we\nidentify more than a dozen relations between several classes of differential\ninvariants and compare their deductive power. As our main results, we analyze\nthe deductive power of differential cuts and the deductive power of\ndifferential invariants with auxiliary differential variables. We refute the\ndifferential cut elimination hypothesis and show that, unlike standard cuts,\ndifferential cuts are fundamental proof principles that strictly increase the\ndeductive power.

In such\napplications, evolutionary clustering typically outperforms traditional static\nclustering by producing clustering results that reflect long-term trends while\nbeing robust to short-term variations. Several evolutionary clustering\nalgorithms have recently been proposed, often by adding a temporal smoothness\npenalty to the cost function of a static clustering method. In this paper, we\nintroduce a different approach to evolutionary clustering by accurately\ntracking the time-varying proximities between objects followed by static\nclustering. We present an evolutionary clustering framework that adaptively\nestimates the optimal smoothing parameter using shrinkage estimation, a\nstatistical approach that improves a naive estimate using additional\ninformation. The proposed framework can be used to extend a variety of static\nclustering algorithms, including hierarchical, k-means, and spectral\nclustering, into evolutionary clustering algorithms. Experiments on synthetic\nand real data sets indicate that the proposed framework outperforms static\nclustering and existing evolutionary clustering algorithms in many scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 16:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 22:35:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 16:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We first introduce three basic Internet resource\npricing models through an Internet cost analysis. Then, with the evolution of\nservice types, we introduce several corresponding mechanisms which can ensure\npricing implementation and resource allocation. On network resource pricing\nmethods, we discuss the utility optimization in economics, and emphasize two\nclasses of pricing methods (including system optimization and entities'\nstrategic optimizations). Finally, we conclude the paper and forecast the\nresearch direction on pricing strategy which is applicable to novel service\nsituation in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 17:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The shape of the mean\ncontinuum, is similar to that measured at low-z (z~1), but the equivalent width\nof the emission lines are larger at low redshift. We calculate the correlation\nbetween fluxes at different wavelengths and find that the emission line fluxes\nin the red part of the spectrum are correlated with that in the blue part. We\nconstruct a projection matrix to predict the continuum in the Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest from the red part of the spectrum. We apply this matrix to quasars in\nthe SDSS-DR7 to derive the evolution with redshift of the mean flux in the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest due to the absorption by the intergalactic neutral\nhydrogen. A change in the evolution of the mean flux is apparent around z~3 in\nthe sense of a steeper decrease of the mean flux at higher redshifts. The same\nevolution is found when the continuum is estimated from the extrapolation of a\npower-law continuum fitted in the red part of the quasar spectrum if a\ncorrection, derived from simple simulations, is applied. Our findings are\nconsistent with previous determinations using high spectral resolution data. We\nprovide the PCA eigenvectors over the wavelength range 1020-2000 \\AA\\ and the\ndistribution of their weights that can be used to simulate QSO mock spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 18:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

This allows them not only to learn successful\nstrategies and adapt to them, but also to condition their own behavior on the\nbehavior of others, in a strategic forward looking manner. Game theory of\nrepeated games shows that these circumstances are conducive to the emergence of\ncollaboration in simple games of two players. We investigate the extension of\nthis concept to the case where players are engaged in a local contribution game\nand show that rationality and credibility of threats identify a class of Nash\nequilibria -- that we call \"collaborative equilibria\" -- that have a precise\ninterpretation in terms of sub-graphs of the social network. For large network\ngames, the number of such equilibria is exponentially large in the number of\nplayers. When incentives to defect are small, equilibria are supported by local\nstructures whereas when incentives exceed a threshold they acquire a non-local\nnature, which requires a \"critical mass\" of more than a given fraction of the\nplayers to collaborate. Therefore, when incentives are high, an individual\ndeviation typically causes the collapse of collaboration across the whole\nsystem. At the same time, higher incentives to defect typically support\nequilibria with a higher density of collaborators. The resulting picture\nconforms with several results in sociology and in the experimental literature\non game theory, such as the prevalence of collaboration in denser groups and in\nthe structural hubs of sparse networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 19:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Here we\nuse the ORION adaptive mesh refinement code to conduct the first ever\nradiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the global collapse scenario for the\nformation of an ONC-like cluster. We show that radiative feedback has a\ndramatic effect on the evolution: once the first ~10-20% of the gas mass is\nincorporated into stars, their radiative feedback raises the gas temperature\nhigh enough to suppress any further fragmentation. However, gas continues to\naccrete onto existing stars, and, as a result, the stellar mass distribution\nbecomes increasingly top-heavy, eventually rendering it incompatible with the\nobserved IMF. Systematic variation in the location of the IMF peak as star\nformation proceeds is incompatible with the observed invariance of the IMF\nbetween star clusters, unless some unknown mechanism synchronizes the IMFs in\ndifferent clusters by ensuring that star formation is always truncated when the\nIMF peak reaches a particular value.

We investigate\nthe variability of the 6.4-keV line emission of four clouds through spectral\nfitting of the EPIC MOS data with the use of a modelled background, which\navoids many of the systematics inherent in local background subtraction. We\nalso employ spectral stacking of both EPIC PN and MOS data to search for\nevidence of an Fe-K edge feature imprinted on the underlying X-ray continuum.\nThe lightcurves of the Fe-Ka line from three bright molecular knots close to\nthe Arches cluster are found to be constant over the 8-year observation window.\nWest of the cluster, however, we found a bright cloud exhibiting the fastest\nFe-Ka variability yet seen in a molecular cloud in the Galactic Center region.\nThe time-averaged spectra of the molecular clouds reveal no convincing evidence\nof the 7.1-keV edge feature. The EW of the 6.4-keV line emitted by the clouds\nnear the cluster is found to be ~1.0 keV. The observed Fe-Ka line flux and the\nhigh EW suggest the fluorescence has a photoionization origin, although\nexcitation by cosmic-ray particles is not specifically excluded. For the three\nclouds nearest to the cluster, an identification of the source of\nphoto-ionizing photons with an earlier outburst of Sgr A* is however at best\ntentative. The hardness of the nonthermal component associated with the 6.4-keV\nline emission might be best explained in terms of bombardment by cosmic-ray\nparticles from the Arches cluster itself. The relatively short-timescale\nvariability seen in the 6.4-keV line emission from the cloud to the West of the\ncluster is most likely the result of illumination by a nearby transient X-ray\nsource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In the absence of a compelling theory\nto explain the observations, a first task is to develop a robust phenomenology.\nIf the acceleration is driven by some form of dark energy, then, the\nphenomenology is determined by the dark energy equation of state w. A major aim\nof ongoing and upcoming cosmological surveys is to measure w and its time\ndependence at high accuracy. Since w(z) is not directly accessible to\nmeasurement, powerful reconstruction methods are needed to extract it reliably\nfrom observations. We have recently introduced a new reconstruction method for\nw(z) based on Gaussian process modeling. This method can capture nontrivial\ntime-dependences in w(z) and, most importantly, it yields controlled and\nunbaised error estimates. In this paper we extend the method to include a\ndiverse set of measurements: baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic microwave\nbackground measurements, and supernova data. We analyze currently available\ndata sets and present the resulting constraints on w(z), finding that current\nobservations are in very good agreement with a cosmological constant. In\naddition we explore how well our method captures nontrivial behavior of w(z) by\nanalyzing simulated data assuming high-quality observations from future\nsurveys.

When the tops\ndecay, these correlations imprint themselves on the angular patterns of the\nfinal quarks and leptons. While many approaches to the measurement of top spin\ncorrelations are known, the most common ones require detailed kinematic\nreconstructions and are insensitive to some important spin interference\neffects. In particular, spin-1 resonances with mostly-vector or mostly-axial\ncouplings to top cannot be easily discriminated from one another without\nappealing to mass-suppressed effects or to more model-dependent interference\nwith continuum Standard Model production. Here, we propose to probe the\nstructure of a resonance's couplings to tops by measuring the azimuthal angles\nof the tops' decay products about the production axis. These angles exhibit\nmodulations which are typically O(0.1-1), and which by themselves allow for\ndiscrimination of spin-0 from higher spins, measurement of the CP-phase for\nspin-0, and measurement of the vector/axial composition for spins 1 and 2. For\nrelativistic tops, the azimuthal decay angles can be well-approximated without\ndetailed knowledge of the tops' velocities, and appear to be robust against\nimperfect energy measurements and neutrino reconstructions. We illustrate this\npoint in the highly challenging dileptonic decay mode, which also exhibits the\nlargest modulations.

We consider various\nmodifications to the red-sequence matched filter richness estimator of Rozo et\nal. (2009), and evaluate their impact on the scatter in X-ray luminosity at\nfixed richness. Most significantly, we find that deeper luminosity cuts can\nreduce the recovered scatter, finding that sigma_lnLX|lambda=0.63+/-0.02 for\nclusters with M_500c >~ 1.6e14 h_70^-1 M_sun. The corresponding scatter in mass\nat fixed richness is sigma_lnM|lambda ~ 0.2-0.3 depending on the richness,\ncomparable to that for total X-ray luminosity. We find that including blue\ngalaxies in the richness estimate increases the scatter, as does weighting\ngalaxies by their optical luminosity. We further demonstrate that our richness\nestimator is very robust. Specifically, the filter employed when estimating\nrichness can be calibrated directly from the data, without requiring a-priori\ncalibrations of the red-sequence. We also demonstrate that the recovered\nrichness is robust to up to 50% uncertainties in the galaxy background, as well\nas to the choice of photometric filter employed, so long as the filters span\nthe 4000 A break of red-sequence galaxies. Consequently, our richness estimator\ncan be used to compare richness estimates of different clusters, even if they\ndo not share the same photometric data.

These observations\ncorrespond to the recent period of low solar activity when the emission induced\nby cosmic rays is brightest. For the first time, the high statistical\nsignificance of the observations allows clear separation of the two components:\nthe point-like emission from the solar disk due to cosmic ray cascades in the\nsolar atmosphere, and extended emission from the inverse Compton scattering of\ncosmic ray electrons on solar photons in the heliosphere. The observed integral\nflux (>100 MeV) from the solar disk is (4.6 +/- 0.2 [statistical error]\n+1.0/-0.8 [systematic error]) x10^{-7} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which is ~7 times higher\nthan predicted by the \"nominal\" model of Seckel et al.

In contrast, the\nobserved integral flux (>100 MeV) of the extended emission from a region of 20\ndeg radius centered on the Sun, but excluding the disk itself, (6.8 +/-0.7\n[stat.] +0.5/-0.4 [syst.]) x10^{-7} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, along with the observed\nspectrum and the angular profile, are in good agreement with the theoretical\npredictions for the inverse Compton emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 23:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-08"}

Measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is a\npromising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics. However,\nprevious attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity or\nonly approximated it crudely. This paper re-examines the effects of peculiar\nvelocity on the 21cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment and\naddressing several issues for the first time. (1) We show that properly\naccounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of\n21cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the IGM found by previous\nwork that employed the usual optically-thin approximation. (2) The\napproximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightness\ntemperature problem by capping velocity gradient can misestimate the power\nspectrum on all scales. (3) The observed power spectrum in redshift-space\nremains finite even in the optically-thin approximation if one properly\naccounts for the redshift-space distortion. However, results that take full\naccount of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accurate\nin the limit of high spin temperature. (4) The linear theory for redshift-space\ndistortion results in ~30% error in the observationally relevant wavenumber\nrange, at the 50% ionized epoch. (5) We describe and test two numerical schemes\nto calculate the 21cm signal from reionization simulations to incorporate\npeculiar velocity effects in the optically-thin approximation accurately. One\nis particle-based, the other grid-based, and while the former is most accurate,\nwe demonstrate that the latter is computationally more efficient and can\nachieve sufficient accuracy.

A low-complexity linear beamforming\nstrategy that allocates equal power and one spatial eigen-mode to each user is\nemployed at the transmitter. Beamforming vectors on the Grassmann manifold that\ndepend only on statistical information are to be designed at the transmitter to\nmaximize the ergodic sum-rate delivered to the two users. Towards this goal,\nthe beamforming vectors are first fixed and a closed-form expression is\nobtained for the ergodic sum-rate in terms of the covariance matrices of the\nlinks. This expression is non-convex in the beamforming vectors ensuring that\nthe classical Lagrange multiplier technique is not applicable. Despite this\ndifficulty, the optimal solution to this problem is shown to be the solution to\nthe maximization of an appropriately-defined average signal-to-interference and\nnoise ratio (SINR) metric for each user.

In\nthis review article we explain that EM algorithm is a natural computational\nscheme for learning image templates of object categories where the learning is\nnot fully supervised. We represent an image template by an active basis model,\nwhich is a linear composition of a selected set of localized, elongated and\noriented wavelet elements that are allowed to slightly perturb their locations\nand orientations to account for the deformations of object shapes. The model\ncan be easily learned when the objects in the training images are of the same\npose, and appear at the same location and scale. This is often called\nsupervised learning. In the situation where the objects may appear at different\nunknown locations, orientations and scales in the training images, we have to\nincorporate the unknown locations, orientations and scales as latent variables\ninto the image generation process, and learn the template by EM-type\nalgorithms. The E-step imputes the unknown locations, orientations and scales\nbased on the currently learned template. This step can be considered\nself-supervision, which involves using the current template to recognize the\nobjects in the training images. The M-step then relearns the template based on\nthe imputed locations, orientations and scales, and this is essentially the\nsame as supervised learning. So the EM learning process iterates between\nrecognition and supervised learning. We illustrate this scheme by several\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 06:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-13"}

We have developed a\nlake-atmosphere equilibrium model allowing the determination of the chemical\ncomposition of these liquid areas. The model is based on uncertain\nthermodynamic data and precipitation rates of organic species predicted to be\npresent in the lakes and seas that are subject to spatial and temporal\nvariations. Here we explore and discuss the influence of these uncertainties\nand variations. The errors and uncertainties relevant to thermodynamic data are\nsimulated via Monte-Carlo simulations. Global Circulation Models (GCM) are also\nemployed in order to investigate the possibility of chemical asymmetry between\nthe south and the north poles, due to differences in precipitation rates. We\nfind that mole fractions of compounds in the liquid phase have a high\nsensitivity to thermodynamic data used as inputs, in particular molar volumes\nand enthalpies of vaporization. When we combine all considered uncertainties,\nthe ranges of obtained mole fractions are rather large (up to ~8500%) but the\ndistributions of values are narrow. The relative standard deviations remain\nbetween 10% and ~300% depending on the compound considered. Compared to other\nsources of uncertainties and variability, deviation caused by surface pressure\nvariations are clearly negligible, remaining of the order of a few percent up\nto ~20%. Moreover no significant difference is found between the composition of\nlakes located in north and south poles. Because the theory of regular solutions\nemployed here is sensitive to thermodynamic data and is not suitable for polar\nmolecules such as HCN and CH3CN, our work strongly underlines the need for\nexperimental simulations and the improvement of Titan's atmospheric models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 08:05:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 06:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Via a spectral disentangling analysis we measure the minimum masses of\nthe stars to be M_A sin^3 i = 3.213 +/- 0.007 M_sun and M_B sin^3 i = 2.323 +/-\n0.006 M_sun, their effective temperatures to be T_eff(A) = 12840 +/- 120 K and\nT_eff(B) = 10580 +/- 240 K, and their projected rotational velocities to be v_A\nsin i_A = 14.5 +/- 0.1 km/s and v_B sin i_B = 4.6 +/- 0.1 km/s. These projected\nrotational velocities appear to be much lower than the synchronous values. We\nshow that measurements of the apsidal motion of the system suffer from a\ndegeneracy between orbital eccentricity and apsidal motion rate. We use our\nspectroscopically-measured e = 0.164 +/- 0.001 to break this degeneracy and\nmeasure (d omega_obs / dt) = 0.133 +/- 0.010 deg/yr.

This value is much smaller than the rate predicted by stellar\ntheory, 0.40--0.87 deg/yr. We interpret this as a misalignment between the\norbital axis of the close binary and the rotational axes of its component\nstars, which also explains their apparently low rotational velocities. The\nobserved and predicted apsidal motion rates could be brought into agreement if\nthe stars were rotating three times faster than synchronous about axes\nperpendicular to the orbital axis.

The longitudinal\nelectric field of a laser-generated plasma wave is used to wiggle electrons\ntransversally. The period of this plasma undulator being equal to the plasma\nwavelength, tunable photon energies in the 10 keV range can be achieved with\nelectron energies in the 100-200 MeV range. Considering a 10s TW class\nfemtosecond laser system, undulators with a strength parameter K~0.5 and with\nabout ten periods can be combined with a laser-plasma accelerator, resulting in\nseveral 10^-2 emitted x-ray photons per electron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 12:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-25"}

Results: While the\noverall structure of the multi-wavelength continuum data resembles each other\nwell, there are several intriguing differences. The 24mum emission stemming\nlargely from small dust grains follows tightly the spatial structure of the cm\nemission tracing the ionized free-free emission. Hence warm dust resides in\nregions that are spatially associated with the ionized hot gas (~10^4 K) of the\nHII regions. Furthermore, we find several evolutionary stages within the same\ncomplexes, ranging from infrared-observable clusters, via deeply embedded\nregions associated with active star formation traced by 24\\,$\\mu$m and cm\nemission, to at least one high-mass gas clump devoid of any such signature.

The mechanical\nmotion is coupled to the optical power circulating inside the cavity both\ndirectly through the radiation pressure and indirectly through heating that\ngives rise to a frequency shift in the mechanical resonance and to thermal\ndeformation. The the energy stored in the optical cavity is assumed to follow\nthe mirror displacement without any lag. In contrast, a finite thermal\nrelaxation rate introduces retardation effects into the mechanical equation of\nmotion through temperature dependent terms. Using standard averaging and\nharmonic balance techniques, slow envelope evolution equations are derived. In\nthe limit of small mechanical vibrations, the micromechanical system can be\ndescribed as a nonlinear Duffing-like oscillator. Coupling to the optical\ncavity is shown to introduce corrections to the linear dissipation, the\nnonlinear dissipation and the nonlinear elastic constants of the\nmicromechanical mirror. The magnitude and the sign of these corrections depend\non the exact position of the mirror and on the optical power incident on the\ncavity.

The description of chiral symmetry\nbreaking and translational symmetry breaking can become intertwined. Here, the\nfocus is on aspects of chiral symmetry breaking and its possible restoration\nthat are by construction independent of the nature of translational symmetry\nbreaking---namely spatial averages of chiral order parameters. A system will be\nconsidered to be chirally restored provided all spatially-averaged chiral order\nparameters are zero. A critical question is whether chiral restoration in this\nsense is possible for phases in which chiral order parameters are locally\nnon-zero but whose spatial averages all vanish. We show that this is not\npossible unless all chirally-invariant observables are spatially uniform. This\nresult is first derived for Skyrme-type models, which are based on a nonlinear\nsigma model and by construction break chiral symmetry on a point-by-point\nbasis. A no-go theorem for chiral restoration (in the average sense) for all\nmodels of this type is obtained by showing that in these models there exist\nchirally symmetric order parameters which cannot be spatially uniform. Next we\nshow that the no-go theorem applies to large N_c QCD in any phase which has a\nnon-zero but spatially varying chiral condensate. The theorem is demonstrated\nby showing that in a putative chirally-restored phase, the field configuration\ncan be reduced to that of a nonlinear sigma model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 14:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-04"}

Integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) can overcome this limitation, and\nhere we present a study of the PN population in the nearby compact elliptical\nM32. Using SAURON data taken with just two 10-minutes-long pointings we have\ndoubled the number of known PNe within the effective radius of M32, detecting\nPNe five times fainter than previously found in narrow-band images that\ncollected nearly the same number of photons.

Finally, owing to the\nproximity of M32 and to UV images taken with HST, we could identify the most\nlikely candidates for the central star of a subset of our detected PNe and\nconclude that these stars are affected by substantial amounts of circumstellar\ndust extinction, a finding that could reconcile the intriguing discrepancy\npreviously reported in M32 between model predictions and observations for the\nlater stages of stellar evolution.

We apply a method for nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic\nfield modelling of photospheric vector magnetograms in spherical geometry which\nallows us to study the connectivity between multi-active regions. We use vector\nmagnetograph data from the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun\nsurvey (SOLIS)/Vector Spectromagnetograph(VSM) to model the coronal magnetic\nfield, where we study three neighbouring magnetically connected active regions\n(ARs: 10987, 10988, 10989) observed on 28, 29, and 30 March 2008, respectively.\nWe compare the magnetic field topologies and the magnetic energy densities and\nstudy the connectivities between the active regions(ARs). We have studied the\ntime evolution of magnetic field over the period of three days and found no\nmajor changes in topologies as there was no major eruption event. From this\nstudy we have concluded that active regions are much more connected\nmagnetically than the electric current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 15:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-13"}

The mesoscopic description is performed by means of the Vlasov scaling,\nwhich yields a linear infinite chain of equations obtained from those for the\ncorrelation function. Its main peculiarity is that, for the initial correlation\nfunction of the inhomogeneous Poisson measure, the solution is the correlation\nfunction of such a measure with density which solves a nonlinear differential\nequation of convolution type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 15:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}
