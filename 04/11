Here it is argued that the reason is that they can all be\ndescribed as outcomes of a ubiquitous random group division: the elements can\nbe citizens of a country and the groups family names, or the elements can be\nall the words making up a novel and the groups the unique words, or the\nelements could be inhabitants and the groups the cities in a country, and so\non. A Random Group Formation (RGF) is presented from which a Bayesian estimate\nis obtained based on minimal information: it provides the best prediction for\nthe number of groups with $k$ elements, given the total number of elements,\ngroups, and the number of elements in the largest group. For each specification\nof these three values, the RGF predicts a unique group distribution\n$N(k)\\propto \\exp(-bk)/k^{\\gamma}$, where the power-law index $\\gamma$ is a\nunique function of the same three values. The universality of the result is\nmade possible by the fact that no system specific assumptions are made about\nthe mechanism responsible for the group division. The direct relation between\n$\\gamma$ and the total number of elements, groups, and the number of elements\nin the largest group, is calculated. The predictive power of the RGF model is\ndemonstrated by direct comparison with data from a variety of systems. It is\nshown that $\\gamma$ usually takes values in the interval $1\\leq\\gamma\\leq 2$\nand that the value for a given phenomena depends in a systematic way on the\ntotal size of the data set. The results are put in the context of earlier\ndiscussions on Zipf's and Gibrat's laws, $N(k)\\propto k^{-2}$ and the\nconnection between growth models and RGF is elucidated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2011 18:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Waves and flows are often observed\nsimultaneously. Due to plasma inhomogeneity in the perpendicular direction to\nthe magnetic field, kink waves are spatially damped by resonant absorption. The\npresence of flow may affect the wave spatial damping. Here, we investigate the\neffect of longitudinal background flow on the propagation and spatial damping\nof resonant kink waves in transversely nonuniform magnetic flux tubes. We\ncombine approximate analytical theory with numerical investigation. The\nanalytical theory uses the thin tube (TT) and thin boundary (TB) approximations\nto obtain expressions for the wavelength and the damping length. Numerically,\nwe verify the previously obtained analytical expressions by means of the full\nsolution of the resistive MHD eigenvalue problem beyond the TT and TB\napproximations. We find that the backward and forward propagating waves have\ndifferent wavelengths and are damped on length scales that are inversely\nproportional to the frequency as in the static case. However, the factor of\nproportionality depends on the characteristics of the flow, so that the damping\nlength differs from its static analogue. For slow, sub-Alfvenic flows the\nbackward propagating wave gets damped on a shorter length scale than in the\nabsence of flow, while for the forward propagating wave the damping length is\nlonger. The different properties of the waves depending on their direction of\npropagation with respect to the background flow may be detected by the\nobservations and may be relevant for seismological applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2011 18:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

It turns out that half of these modes have negative energy but after\ndefining the inner product we conclude that they are non-physical and should be\nselected out. We are left with the usual graviton modes but with a chiral\nasymmetry in the the vacuum energy and fluctuations. The latter depends on\n\\gamma and on the ordering prescription (namely in the Hamiltonian constraint).\nSuch an effect would leave a distinctive imprint in the polarization of the\ncosmic microwave background, thus finally engaging quantum gravity in\nmeaningful experimental test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2011 20:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 11:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-08"}

While the general claim is\ncorrect, the discussions have been incomplete and, sometimes, misleading. The\ndiscussions have been of three kinds. Type 1 examines the time dependence of\nthe survival probability for 3-momentum eigenstates of the unstable quanton\n(Khalfin). Type 2 does the same for velocity eigenstates, obtaining an\noutrageous result which then discredits velocity eigenstates (Shirokov /\nHegerfeldt). Type 3 examines arbitrary boosts of 3-momentum eigenstates\n(Stefanovich). Type 1 is incomplete since the momentum eigenstates are not the\nboosts of one another. Type 2 is misleading since the outrageous result is due\nto misinterpreting the initial conditions of the velocity eigenstates (as I\nhave previously argued). Type 3 is the most satisfactory, but has failed to\nrecognize and implement the unification of all three types of discussion that\ncan be achieved.

In such systems, generally we expect\nboth long-range and short-range interactions to exist. In the short-range Ising\nmodel, the correlation length diverges at the critical point. In contrast, in\nthe long-range interacting model the spin configuration is always uniform and\nthe correlation length is zero.

Vizing's theorem states that\nthe edge coloring of a simple graph $G$ requires either $\\Delta$ or $\\Delta+1$\ncolors, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum vertex degree of $G$. Holyer proved that\nit is {\\bf NP}-complete to decide whether $G$ is $\\Delta$-edge-colorable even\nfor cubic graphs. By introducing the concept of complex colors, we show that\nthe color-exchange operation follows the same multiplication rules as\nquaternion. An initially $\\Delta$-edge-colored graph $G$ allows\nvariable-colored edges, which can be eliminated by color exchanges in a manner\nsimilar to variable eliminations in solving systems of linear equations. The\nproblem is solved if all variables are eliminated and a properly\n$\\Delta$-edge-colored graph is reached.

Remarkable advantages of a gas monochromator based on\nthis principle are simplicity, efficiency and narrow-bandwidth. A gas\nmonochromator installed in the experimental hall of a VUV SASE FEL facility\nwould enable the delivery of a single-mode VUV laser beam. The design is\nidentical to that of already existing gas attenuator systems for VUV or X-ray\nFELs. We present feasibility study and exemplifications for the FLASH facility\nin the VUV regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 08:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Beyond charge two the minimal energy monopole has only a discrete\nsymmetry, which is often Platonic. The rational map approximation provides an\nupper bound on the monopole energy and may be viewed as a smooth non-abelian\nrefinement of the magnetic bag approximation, to which it reverts under some\nadditional approximations.

Main result of this paper asserts that the jump of\nthe singular spectral shift function at a resonance point is equal to the\nso-called resonance index, --- a new (to the best of my knowledge) notion\nintroduced in this paper.\n  Resonance index can be described as follows. For a fixed $\\lambda$ the\nresonance points $r_0$ of a path $H_r$ of self-adjoint operators are real poles\nof a certain meromorphic function associated with the triple $(\\lambda+i0;\nH_0,V).$ When $\\lambda+i0$ is shifted to $\\lambda+iy$ with small $y>0,$ that\npole get off the real axis in the coupling constant complex plane and, in\ngeneral, splits into some $N_+$ poles in the upper half-plane and some $N_-$\npoles in the lower half-plane (counting multiplicities).

Were it people who moved and outplaced the indigenous hunter-\ngatherer groups or admixed with them? Or was it just material and information\nthat moved-the Neolithic Package-consisting of domesticated plants and animals\nand the knowledge of its use? The latter process is commonly referred to as\ncultural diffusion and the former as demic diffusion. Despite continuous and\npartly combined efforts by archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists,\npaleontologists and geneticists a final resolution of the debate has not yet\nbeen reached. In the present contribution we interpret results from the Global\nLand Use and technological Evolution Simulator (GLUES), a mathematical model\nfor regional sociocultural development embedded in the western Eurasian\ngeoenvironmental context during the Holocene. We demonstrate that the model is\nable to realistically hindcast the expansion speed and the inhomogeneous\nspace-time evolution of the transition to agropastoralism in Europe. GLUES, in\ncontrast to models that do not resolve endogenous sociocultural dynamics, also\ndescribes and explains how and why the Neolithic advanced in stages. In the\nmodel analysis, we uncouple the mechanisms of migration and information\nexchange. We find that (1) an indigenous form of agropastoralism could well\nhave arisen in certain Mediterranean landscapes, but not in Northern and\nCentral Europe, where it depended on imported technology and material, (2) both\ndemic diffusion by migration or cultural diffusion by trade may explain the\nwestern European transition equally well, (3) [...]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 11:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 08:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}

With the arrival of the next generation of ground-based imaging\ninterferometers combining from 4 to possibly 6 telescopes simultaneously, there\nis also a strong need for a new generation of fringe trackers able to cophase\nsuch arrays. These instruments have to be very sensitive and to provide robust\noperations in quickly varying observational conditions.\n  Aims. We aim at defining the optimal characteristics of fringe sensor\nconcepts operating with 4 or 6 telescopes. The current detector limitations\nimpose us to consider solutions based on co-axial pairwise combination schemes.\n  Methods. We independently study several aspects of the fringe sensing\nprocess: 1) how to measure the phase and the group delay, and 2) how to combine\nthe telescopes in order to ensure a precise and robust fringe tracking in real\nconditions. Thanks to analytical developments and numerical simulations, we\ndefine the optimal fringe-sensor concepts and compute the expected performance\nof the 4-telescope one with our dedicated end-to-end simulation tool sim2GFT.\n  Results. We first show that measuring the phase and the group delay by\nobtaining the data in several steps (i.e. by temporally modulating the optical\npath difference) is extremely sensitive to atmospheric turbulence and therefore\nconclude that it is better to obtain the fringe position with a set of data\nobtained simultaneously. Subsequently, we show that among all co-axial pairwise\nschemes, moderately redundant concepts increase the sensitivity as well as the\nrobustness in various atmospheric or observing conditions. Merging all these\nresults, end-to-end simulations show that our 4-telescope fringe sensor concept\nis able to track fringes at least 90% of the time up to limiting magnitudes of\n7.5 and 9.5 for the 1.8- and 8.2-meter VLTI telescopes respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 13:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

It was recently found that orientation\npreference maps (OPMs) obey statistical laws which are apparently invariant\namong species widely separated in eutherian evolution. Here, we examine whether\none of the most prominent models for the optimization of cortical maps, the\nelastic net (EN) model, can reproduce this common design. The EN model\ngenerates representations which optimally trade of stimulus space coverage and\nmap continuity. While this model has been used in numerous studies, no\nanalytical results about the precise layout of the predicted OPMs have been\nobtained so far. We present a mathematical approach to analytically calculate\nthe cortical representations predicted by the EN model for the joint mapping of\nstimulus position and orientation. We find that in all previously studied\nregimes, predicted OPM layouts are perfectly periodic. An unbiased search\nthrough the EN parameter space identifies a novel regime of aperiodic OPMs with\npinwheel densities lower than found in experiments. In an extreme limit,\naperiodic OPMs quantitatively resembling experimental observations emerge.\nStabilization of these layouts results from strong nonlocal interactions rather\nthan from a coverage-continuity-compromise. Our results demonstrate that\noptimization models for stimulus representations dominated by nonlocal\nsuppressive interactions are in principle capable of correctly predicting the\ncommon OPM design. They question that visual cortical feature representations\ncan be explained by a coverage-continuity-compromise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 13:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2011 13:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In recent years it has been possible to use the Fe K line and\nreflection continuum to parametrize the ionization state of the irradiated\ninner accretion disk. Here, we collect 10 measurements of xi, the disk\nionization parameter, from 8 AGNs with strong evidence for reflection from the\ninner accretion disk and good black hole mass estimates. We find strong\nstatistical evidence (98.56% confidence) for a nearly linear correlation\nbetween xi and the AGN Eddington ratio. Moreover, such a correlation is\npredicted by a simple application of alpha-disk accretion theory, albeit with a\nstronger dependence on the Eddington ratio. The theory shows that there will be\nintrinsic scatter to any correlation as a result of different black hole spins\nand radii of reflection. There are several possibilities to soften the\npredicted dependence on the Eddington ratio to allow a closer agreement with\nthe observed correlation, but the current data does not allow for an unique\nexplanation. The correlation can be used to estimate that MCG-6-30-15 should\nhave a highly ionized inner accretion disk, which would imply a black hole spin\nof ~0.8. Additional measurements of xi from a larger sample of AGNs are needed\nto confirm the existence of this correlation, and will allow investigation of\nthe accretion disk/corona interaction in the inner regions of accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 15:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
