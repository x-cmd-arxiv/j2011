This is partially motivated\nby the observed bimodal inclination distribution and by the putative physical\ndifferences between the low- and high-inclination populations. We find that\nsome classical KBOs undergo large changes in inclination over gigayear\ntimescales, which means that a current member of the low-inclination population\nmay have been in the high-inclination population in the past, and vice versa.\nThe dynamical mechanisms responsible for the time-variability of inclinations\nare predominantly distant encounters with Neptune and chaotic diffusion near\nthe boundaries of mean motion resonances. We reassess the correlations between\ninclination and physical properties including inclination time-variability. We\nfind that the size-inclination and color-inclination correlations are less\nstatistically significant than previously reported (mostly due to the increased\nsize of the data set since previous works with some contribution from\ninclination variability).

For molecular pairs composed of a He\natom and an S-state atom, the molecular spin is stable during formation,\ndissociation, and collisions, and thus these molecules can be magnetically\ntrapped. Collisional spin relaxations are too slow to affect trap lifetimes.\nHowever, helium-3-containing complexes can change spin due to adiabatic\ncrossings between trapped and untrapped Zeeman states, mediated by the\nanisotropic hyperfine interaction, causing trap loss.

That is,\ncomets from the nearly-isotropic class were most likely fed into their current\nreservoir, the Oort cloud, from a source region near the formation location of\nEnceladus. Dynamical simulations of the formation of the Oort cloud indicate\nthat Uranus and Neptune are, primarily, responsible for the delivery of\nmaterial into the Oort cloud. In addition, Enceladus formed from material that\ncondensed from the solar nebula near the location at which Saturn captured its\ngas envelope, most likely at or near Saturn's current location in the solar\nsystem. The coupling of these lines of evidence appears to require that Uranus\nand Neptune were, during the epoch of the formation of the Oort cloud, much\ncloser to the current location of Saturn than they are currently. Such a\nconfiguration is consistent with the Nice model of the evolution of the outer\nsolar system. Further measurements of the D/H enrichment in comets,\nparticularly in ecliptic comets, will provide an excellent discriminator among\nvarious models of the formation of the outer solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 17:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A key objective for the analysis and\nverification of these games is the termination objective, where the players aim\nto maximize (minimize, respectively) the probability of hitting counter value\n0, starting at a given control state and given counter value. Recently, we\nstudied qualitative decision problems (\"is the optimal termination value = 1?\")\nfor OC-MDPs (and OC-SSGs) and showed them to be decidable in P-time (in NP and\ncoNP, respectively). However, quantitative decision and approximation problems\n(\"is the optimal termination value ? p\", or \"approximate the termination value\nwithin epsilon\") are far more challenging. This is so in part because optimal\nstrategies may not exist, and because even when they do exist they can have a\nhighly non-trivial structure. It thus remained open even whether any of these\nquantitative termination problems are computable. In this paper we show that\nall quantitative approximation problems for the termination value for OC-MDPs\nand OC-SSGs are computable. Specifically, given a OC-SSG, and given epsilon >\n0, we can compute a value v that approximates the value of the OC-SSG\ntermination game within additive error epsilon, and furthermore we can compute\nepsilon-optimal strategies for both players in the game. A key ingredient in\nour proofs is a subtle martingale, derived from solving certain LPs that we can\nassociate with a maximizing OC-MDP. An application of Azuma's inequality on\nthese martingales yields a computable bound for the \"wealth\" at which a \"rich\nperson's strategy\" becomes epsilon-optimal for OC-MDPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 17:42:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 14:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

This makes the present work the\ncenterpiece of a broadly applicable full CSL model checker.

In two\ndecades, phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, granular piles, snow avalanches,\nsolar flares, superconducting vortices, sub-critical fracture, evolution, and\neven stock market crashes have been reported to evolve through scale invariant\navalanches. The theory, based on the key axiom that a critical state is an\nattractor of the dynamics, presented an exponent close to -1 (in two\ndimensions) for the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes. However, the\nmajority of real phenomena classified as SOC present smaller exponents, i.e.,\nlarger absolute values of negative exponents, a situation that has provoked a\nlot of confusion in the field of scale invariant avalanches. The main goal of\nthis chapter is to shed light on this issue. The essential role of the exponent\nvalue of the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes is discussed. The\nexponent value controls the ratio of small and large events, the energy balance\n--required for stationary systems-- and the critical properties of the\ndynamics. A condition of criticality is introduced. As the exponent value\ndecreases, there is a decrease of the critical properties, and consequently the\nsystem becomes, in principle, predictable. Prediction of scale invariant\navalanches in both experiments and simulations are presented. Other sources of\nconfusion as the use of logarithmic scales, and the avalanche dynamics in well\nestablished critical systems, are also revised; as well as the influence of\ndissipation and disorder in the \"self-organization\" of scale invariant\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 18:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-27"}

Mid-IR observations, which span the peak of the\nthermal spectral energy distribution, provide useful constraints on the\nproperties of the dust and, ultimately, the circumstellar environment,\nexplosion mechanism, and progenitor system. Due to the low SN IIn rate (<10% of\nall core-collapse SNe), few IR observations exist for this subclass. The\nhandful of isolated studies, however, show late-time IR emission from warm dust\nthat, in some cases, extends for five or six years post-discovery. While\nprevious Spitzer/IRAC surveys have searched for dust in SNe, none have targeted\nthe Type IIn subclass. This article presents results from a warm Spitzer/IRAC\nsurvey of the positions of all 68 known SNe IIn within a distance of 250 Mpc\nbetween 1999 and 2008 that have remained unobserved by Spitzer more than 100\ndays post-discovery. The detection of late-time emission from ten targets\n(~15%) nearly doubles the database of existing mid-IR observations of SNe IIn.\nAlthough optical spectra show evidence for new dust formation in some cases,\nthe data show that in most cases the likely origin of the mid-IR emission is\npre-existing dust, which is continuously heated by optical emission generated\nby ongoing circumstellar interaction between the forward shock and\ncircumstellar medium. Furthermore, an emerging trend suggests that these SNe\ndecline at ~1000--2000 days post-discovery once the forward shock overruns the\ndust shell.

In this model, the intra-dimer exchange coupling J>0 is\nantiferromagnetic, while the inter-dimer exchange couplings are ferromagnetic\nand take different values, J_x,J_y<0, in the two bond directions. Anticipating\nthat the highly frustrated character of this model may lead to a wide range of\nbehaviors in (CuCl)LaNb2O7 and related compounds, we theoretically investigate\nthe ground state phase diagram of this model in detail using the following\nthree approaches: a strong-coupling expansion for small J_x and J_y, exact\ndiagonalization for finite clusters, and a Schwinger boson mean field theory.\nWhen |J_x|, |J_y| <~ J, the system stays in a dimer singlet phase with a finite\nspin gap. This state is adiabatically connected to the decoupled-dimer limit\nJ_x=J_y=0. We show that the magnetization process of this phase depends\ncrucially on the spatial anisotropy of the inter-dimer couplings. The\nmagnetization shows a jump or a smooth increase for weak and strong anisotropy,\nrespectively, after the spin gap closes at a certain magnetic field.

(2) The mean sSFR at a given redshift is a\nmonotonically increasing function of decreasing galaxy mass that steepens with\ndecreasing redshift. The general dimming trend with time merely reflects the\ngeneral decline of gas inflow rate with increasing time. The differential\nevolution of galaxies of different masses with redshift is a result of\ngravitational shock heating of gas due to formation of large halos (groups and\nclusters) and large-scale structure that move a progressively larger fraction\nof galaxies and their satellites into environments where gas has too high an\nentropy to cool to continue feeding resident galaxies. Overdense regions where\nlarger halos are preferentially located begin to be heated earlier and have\nhigher temperatures than lower density regions at any given time, causing sSFR\nof larger galaxies to fall below the general dimming trend at higher redshift\nthan less massive galaxies and galaxies with high sSFR to gradually shift to\nlower density environments at lower redshift.

We focus on the bipartition entanglement between one qubit and\nthe remaining qubits constituting the system, which is measured by the\nnegativity. For the two-qubit system, the speed for the pure state completely\ndepends on its entanglement. The upper and lower bounds of the speed for\narbitrary two-qubit states, and the necessary conditions for a state achieving\nthem, are obtained. For the three-qubit system, we study the speed for pure\nstates, whose entanglement properties can be completely described by five\nlocal-unitary-transformation invariants. An analytical expression of the\nrelation between the speed and the invariants is derived. The speed is enhanced\nby the the three-tangle which is the entanglement among the three qubits, but\nreduced by the the two-qubit correlations outside of the concurrence. The decay\nof the negativity can be restrained by the other two negativity with the\ncoequal sense. The unbalance between two qubits can reduce speed of\ndisentanglement of the remaining qubit in the system, even can retrieve the\nentanglement partially. For the k-qubit systems in an arbitrary superposition\nof GHZ state and W state, the speed depends almost entirely on the amount of\nthe negativity when k increases to five or six. An alternative quantitative\ndefinition for the robustness of entanglement is presented based on the speed\nof disentanglement, with comparison to the widely studied robustness measured\nby the critical amount of noise parameter where the entanglement vanishes. In\nthe limit of large number of particles, the alternative robustness of the\nGHZ-type states is inversely proportional to k, and the one of the W states\napproaches 1/\\sqrt{k}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 00:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2011 03:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2012 14:11:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 14:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In such cases, the goal\nshould be to generate plans that are robust with respect to any known\nincompleteness of the domain. In this paper, we first introduce annotations\nexpressing the knowledge of the domain incompleteness, and formalize the notion\nof plan robustness with respect to an incomplete domain model.

The first\nis the classical statistical setting where instances are drawn i.i.d. from a\nfixed distribution and the second scenario is the online learning, completely\nadversarial scenario where adversary at every time step picks the worst\ninstance to provide the learner with. It can be argued that in the real world\nneither of these assumptions are reasonable. It is therefore important to study\nproblems with a range of assumptions on data. Unfortunately, theoretical\nresults in this area are scarce, possibly due to absence of general tools for\nanalysis. Focusing on the regret formulation, we define the minimax value of a\ngame where the adversary is restricted in his moves. The framework captures\nstochastic and non-stochastic assumptions on data. Building on the sequential\nsymmetrization approach, we define a notion of distribution-dependent\nRademacher complexity for the spectrum of problems ranging from i.i.d. to\nworst-case. The bounds let us immediately deduce variation-type bounds. We then\nconsider the i.i.d. adversary and show equivalence of online and batch\nlearnability. In the supervised setting, we consider various hybrid assumptions\non the way that x and y variables are chosen. Finally, we consider smoothed\nlearning problems and show that half-spaces are online learnable in the\nsmoothed model. In fact, exponentially small noise added to adversary's\ndecisions turns this problem with infinite Littlestone's dimension into a\nlearnable problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 04:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-28"}

We consider the more challenging scenario when the agents are identical\nand initially scattered within the network.

The solution of this\n\"softened ODE\" has the following properties: i) it is regular at the edges\n(finite radial accelerations), ii) it possesses the correct long-range\nproperties, iii) it matches the Newtonian potential of a geometrically thin\ndisk very well, and iv) it tends continuously to the flat disk solution in the\nlimit $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$.

Originally the\nproblem was proposed by Soren Riis (who posed the question for pyramid graphs)\nin the following more general form. We are given a natural number k, and k\nquestions can be asked in a round. The goal is to minimize the number of\nrounds. We completely solve this problem for complete t-ary trees. Also, for\npyramid graphs we present some non-trivial partial results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 09:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-28"}

At low temperature, the structure has\nmonoclinic $P2_{1}$ symmetry, with layered ordering of the Na and La ions and\nrocksalt ordering of Mn and W ions. The Mn atoms show an antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) collinear spin ordering, and the compound has been reported as a\npotential multiferroic. By comparing the low symmetry structure with a parent\nphase of $P4/nmm$ symmetry, two distortion modes are found dominant. They\ncorrespond to MnO$_{6}$ and WO$_{6}$ octahedron \\textit{tilt} modes, often\nfound in many simple perovskites. While in the latter these common tilting\ninstabilities yield non-polar phases, in NaLaMnWO$_{6}$ the additional presence\nof the $A$-$A^{'}$ cation ordering is sufficient to make these rigid unit modes\nas a source of the ferroelectricity. Through a trilinear coupling with the two\nunstable tilting modes, a significant polar distortion is induced, although the\nsystem has no intrinsic polar instability. The calculated electric polarization\nresulting from this polar distortion is as large as $\\sim$ 16 ${\\mu}{\\rm\nC/cm^{2}}$. Despite its secondary character, this polarization is coupled with\nthe dominant tilting modes and its switching is bound to produce the switching\nof one of two tilts, enhancing in this way a possible interaction with the\nmagnetic ordering. The transformation of common non-polar purely steric\ninstabilities into sources of ferroelectricity through a controlled\nmodification of the parent structure, as done here by the cation ordering, is a\nphenomenon to be further explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 09:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The\naccretion builds up the star to its final mass and is also believed to power\nthe mass outflows, which may in turn remove the excess angular momentum from\nthe star-disk system. However, although the process of mass accretion is a\ncritical aspect of star formation, some of its mechanisms are still to be fully\nunderstood. A point not considered to date and relevant for the accretion\nprocess is the evidence of very energetic and frequent flaring events in these\nstars. Flares may easily perturb the stability of the disks, thus influencing\nthe transport of mass and angular momentum. Here we report on three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic modeling of the evolution of a flare with an idealized\nnon--equilibrium initial condition occurring near the disk around a rotating\nmagnetized star. The model takes into account the stellar magnetic field, the\ngravitational force, the viscosity of the disk, the magnetic-field-oriented\nthermal conduction (including the effects of heat flux saturation), the\nradiative losses from optically thin plasma, and the coronal heating. We show\nthat, during its first stage of evolution, the flare gives rise to a hot\nmagnetic loop linking the disk to the star. The disk is strongly perturbed by\nthe flare: disk material evaporates under the effect of the thermal conduction\nand an overpressure wave propagates through the disk. When the overpressure\nreaches the opposite side of the disk, a funnel flow starts to develop there,\naccreting substantial disk material onto the young star from the side of the\ndisk opposite to the flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 10:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The results presented in this paper\nare based on 4 large N-body simulations with about 10 billion particles each:\nthe Millennium-I and II, Bolshoi, and MultiDark simulations. The MultiDark (or\nBigBolshoi) simulation is introduced in this paper. This suite of simulations\nwith high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute with\nunprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (about\nsix orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state-of-the-art of our\ncurrent knowledge on this basic property of dark matter halos in the LCDM\ncosmology. We find that there is consistency among the different simulation\ndata sets. We confirm a novel feature for halo concentrations at high\nredshifts: a flattening and upturn with increasing mass. The concentration\nc(M,z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological\nparameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms\nof the linear rms fluctuation of the density field sigma(M,z), the halo\nconcentration c(sigma) shows a nearly-universal simple U-shaped behaviour with\na minimum at a well defined scale at sigma=0.71. Yet, some small dependences\nwith redshift and cosmology still remain. At the high-mass end (sigma < 1) the\nmedian halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highly\nradial orbits. This c-sigma(M,z) relation can be accurately parametrized and\nprovides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass.\nWhen applied to galaxy clusters, our estimates of concentrations are\nsubstantially larger -- by a factor up to 1.5 -- than previous results from\nsmaller simulations, and are in much better agreement with results of\nobservations.

In the rotation experiment pairs of images of identical\nsurface regions taken at different epochs are used to retrieve information on\nMercury's rotation and orientation.

The estimation of\nthe libration amplitude and obliquity through pattern matching of observed\nsurface landmarks is challenging. The main problem arises from the difficulty\nto observe the same landmark on the planetary surface repeatedly over the MPO\nmission lifetime, due to the combination of Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit resonance,\nthe absence of a drift of the MPO polar orbital plane and the need to combine\ndata from different instruments with their own measurement restrictions.

To obtain an exclusive N-jet sample,\none can measure the event shape \"N-jettiness\" \\tau_N and veto additional\nundesired jets by requiring \\tau_N <<1. However, this leads to large logarithms\nof \\tau_N in the cross section, that need to be summed for reliable theory\npredictions. For N=0 in hadronic collisions, \\tau_N reduces to the \"beam\nthrust\" eventshape \\tau_B. We derive a factorization theorem for pp -> XL,\nwhere a central jet veto \\tau_B<<1 is imposed on the hadronic final state X and\nL is non-hadronic. This factorization theorem enables us to sum large\nlogarithms of \\tau_B in the cross section.

D-model is a generic model\nwhich can be expanded into a hierarchy of more refined models including\ndissipation, forcing, etc. D-model can be applied to the experimental and\ntheoretical study of numerous wave turbulent systems appearing in\nhydrodynamics, nonlinear optics, electrodynamics, convection theory, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 15:32:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 09:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-11"}
