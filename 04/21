As singular (single-conclusion) cuts yield trees, which underlie\nordinary natural deduction derivations, so plural cuts yield graphs of a more\ncomplicated kind, related to trees, which this paper defines. Besides the\ninductive definition of these oriented graphs, which is based on sequent\nsystems, a non-inductive, graph-theoretical, combinatorial, definition is\ngiven, and to reach that other definition is the main goal of the paper. As\ntrees underlie multicategories, so the graphs of plural cuts underlie\npolycategories. The graphs of plural cuts are interesting in particular when\nthe plural cuts are appropriate for sequent systems without the structural rule\nof permutation, and the main body of the paper deals with that matter. It gives\na combinatorial characterization of the planarity of the graphs involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 16:06:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2011 15:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 17:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 14:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 18:07:19 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2012 10:54:26 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 18:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-15"}

The main aim of this study is to validate results\nobtained by our inversion code. We simulate travel-time maps using a snapshot\nfrom a numerical simulation of solar convective flows, realistic Born\ntravel-time sensitivity kernels, and a realistic model of travel-time noise.\nThese synthetic travel times are inverted for flows and the results compared\nwith the known input flow field.

The vertical component of velocity (v_z),\nif it were to be weak, is more difficult to infer and is seriously affected by\ncross-talk from horizontal velocity components. We emphasise that this\ncross-talk must be explicitly minimised in order to retrieve v_z in the top 1\nMm. We also show that statistical averaging over many different areas of the\nSun allows for reliably measuring of average properties of all three flow\ncomponents in the top 5.5 Mm of the convection zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 17:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Previous work on maximally random strictly jammed sphere packings in\nthree dimensions has shown that these systems are hyperuniform and possess\nunusual quasi-long-range pair correlations, resulting in anomalous logarithmic\ngrowth in the number variance. However, recent work on maximally random jammed\nsphere packings with a size distribution has suggested that such\nquasi-long-range correlations and hyperuniformity are not universal among\njammed hard-particle systems. In this paper we show that such systems are\nindeed hyperuniform with signature quasi-long-range correlations by\ncharacterizing the more general local-volume-fraction fluctuations.

We find that the high frequency noise\nis filtered by the output degradation process through time-averaging; while the\nlow frequency noise is damped by adaptation through negative feedback. Both\nfiltering processes themselves introduce intrinsic noises, which are found to\nbe unfiltered and can thus amount to a significant internal noise floor even\nwithout signaling. These results are applied to E. coli chemotaxis. We show\nunambiguously that the molecular mechanism for the Berg-Purcell time-averaging\nscheme is the dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY-P, not the\nreceptor adaptation process as previously suggested. The high frequency noise\ndue to the stochastic ligand binding-unbinding events and the random ligand\nmolecule diffusion is averaged by the CheY-P dephosphorylation process to a\nnegligible level in E.coli. We identify a previously unstudied noise source\ncaused by the random motion of the cell in a ligand gradient. We show that this\nrandom walk induced signal noise has a divergent low frequency component, which\nis only rendered finite by the receptor adaptation process. For gradients\nwithin the E. coli sensing range, this dominant external noise can be\ncomparable to the significant intrinsic noise in the system.

This suggests a total\nmolecular gas mass of Mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_CO/0.8) (mu_L/10.9)^-1 Msun.\nThe gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formation\nefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an SMG. The\nvelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensed\nimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region in\nthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.\nThe resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structure\nobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. Major mergers are commonly\nobserved in SMGs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intense\nstarbursts at high gas consumption rates. This study demonstrates the level of\ndetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing the\nincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by\ngravitational lensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-27"}

While\nthe Galactic CO-H2 conversion factor (Xco) appears to be reasonably constant,\nobservations indicate that Xco may be depressed in high-surface density\nstarburst environments. Using a multi-scale approach, we investigate the\ndependence of Xco on the galactic environment in numerical simulations of disc\ngalaxies and galaxy mergers. Xco is proportional to the GMC surface density\ndivided by the integrated CO intensity, Wco, and Wco is related to the kinetic\ntemperature and velocity dispersion in the cloud. In disc galaxies (except\nwithin the central ~ kpc), the galactic environment is largely unimportant in\nsetting the physical properties of GMCs provided they are gravitationally\nbound. The temperatures are roughly constant at ~10 K due to the balance of CO\ncooling and cosmic ray heating, giving a nearly constant CO-H2 conversion\nfactor in discs. In mergers, the velocity dispersion of the gas rises\ndramatically during coalescence. The gas temperature also rises as it couples\nwell to the warm (~50 K) dust at high densities (n > 10^4 cm^-3). The rise in\nvelocity dispersion and temperature combine to offset the rise in surface\ndensity in mergers, causing Xco to drop by a factor of ~2-10 compared to the\ndisc simulation. This model predicts that high-resolution ALMA observations of\nnearby ULIRGs should show velocity dispersions of ~10-100 km/s, and brightness\ntemperatures comparable to the dust temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 20:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 18:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 21:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We numerically\nstudy propagation of 3-dimensional (3D) EMHD wave packets moving in one\ndirection. We obtain two major results: 1. Unlike its magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\ncounterpart, an EMHD wave packet is dispersive. Because of this, EMHD wave\npackets traveling in one direction create opposite traveling wave packets via\nself-interaction and cascade energy to smaller scales. 2. EMHD wave packets\ntraveling in one direction clearly exhibit inverse energy cascade. We find that\nthe latter is due to conservation of magnetic helicity. We compare inverse\nenergy cascade in 3D EMHD turbulence and 2-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 00:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

Partial\nspatial ordering is introduced by the application of a transverse magnetic\nfield that superimposes a periodic modulation on the dielectric randomess. This\nintroduces Bragg scattering which effectively enhances the scattering due to\ndisorder alone, and thus reduces the elastic mean free path towards Anderson\nlocalization. Our theoretical treatment, based on invariant imbedding, gives a\nsimultaneous decrease of transmission and reflection without change of incident\nlinear polarisation as the spatial order is tuned magnetically to the Bragg\ncondition, namely the light wave vector being equal to half the Bragg vector\n(Q). Our experimental observations are in qualitative agreement with these\nresults. We have also given expressions for the transit (sojourn) time of light\nand for the light energy stored in the random medium under steady illumination.\nThe ferrofluid thus provides an interesting physical realization of effectively\na \"Lossy Anderson-Bragg\" (LAB) cavity with which to study the effect of the\ninterplay of spatial disorder, partial order and weak dissipation on light\ntransport. Given the current interest in propagation, optical limiting and\nstorage of light in ferrofluids, the present work seems topical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 05:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The variability level is a monotonic function of the source inclination.\nIt rises more rapidly for larger values of the black hole spin (Kerr parameter)\nand for steeper emissivity (index beta of the radial profile). We compare the\nexpected level of variability for the viewing angle 81.6 deg, as inferred for\nNGC 4258, with the case of moderate viewing angles about 30 deg, typical for\nSeyfert type-1 galaxies. Highly inclined sources such as this one are\nparticularly suitable to test the flare model because the effects of orbital\nmotion, Doppler boosting and light bending are all expected to have maximum\nwhen the accretion disk is seen almost edge-on. The model is consistent with\nthe NGC 4258 variability, where the obscuring material is thought to be\nlocalized mainly towards the equatorial plane rather than forming a\ngeometrically thick torus.

The major aim is to probe the nature of\ncollective modes and in particular to ascertain whether the propagating modes\ncan exist above the ordering temperature.

It has been recognized that, especially in practical\nenvironments, when computing the treewidth of a graph it is invaluable to first\napply an array of preprocessing rules that simplify and shrink it. This work\nseeks to prove rigorous performance guarantees for such preprocessing rules,\nboth known and new ones, by studying them in the framework of kernelization\nfrom parameterized complexity.\n  It is known that the NP-complete problem of determining whether a given graph\nG has treewidth at most k admits no polynomial-time preprocessing algorithm\nthat reduces any input instance to size polynomial in k, unless NP is in\ncoNP/poly and the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level. In this\npaper we therefore consider structural graph measures larger than treewidth,\nand determine whether efficient preprocessing can shrink the instance size to a\npolynomial in such a parameter value.\n  We prove that given an instance (G,k) of treewidth we can efficiently reduce\nits size to O(fvs(G)^4) vertices, where fvs(G) is the size of a minimum\nfeedback vertex set in G. We can also prove a size reduction to O(vc(G)^3)\nvertices, where vc(G) is the size of a minimum vertex cover. Phrased in the\nlanguage of parameterized complexity, we show that Treewidth has a polynomial\nkernel when parameterized by the size of a given feedback vertex set, and also\nby the size of a vertex cover. In contrast we show that Treewidth parameterized\nby the vertex-deletion distance to a single clique, and Weighted Treewidth\nparameterized by the size of a vertex cover, do not admit polynomial\nkernelizations unless NP is in coNP/poly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 09:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 12:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

This new family, called Beta\nskew-normal (BSN), arises naturally when we consider the distributions of order\nstatistics of the SN. The BSN can also be obtained as a special case of the\nBeta generated distribution (Jones (2004)). In this work we pay attention to\nthree other generalizations of the SN distribution: the Balakrishnan\nskew-normal (SNB) (Balakrishnan (2002), as a discussant of Arnold and Beaver\n(2002), Gupta and Gupta (2004), Sharafi and Behboodian (2008)), the generalized\nBalakrishnan skew-normal (GBSN) (Yadegari et al.

The paper is organized as follows: after\ndescribing briefly, in Section 2, the skew-normal distribution, its\ngeneralizations and listing their most important properties, in Section 3 we\npresent some generalizations of the Beta distribution. In the last Section we\ndefine the Beta skew-normal distribution, we present its properties and some\nspecial cases. In particular the BSN contains the Beta half-normal distribution\n(Pescim et al. (2010)) as limiting case. Besides, we investigate its shape\nproperties. We derive its moment generating function and we also compute\nnumerically the first moment, the variance, the skewness and the kurtosis. We\npresent two different methods which allow to simulate a BSN distribution. We\nexplore its relationships with the other generalizations of the SN. We give\nsome results concerning the SNB distribution. In particular we derive the exact\ndistributions of the largest order statistic from SNB with parameters m and 1\nand the shortest order statistic SNB with parameters m and -1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 09:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Here we investigate the effect of varying noise in a model\nsystem, namely an excitable activator-repressor genetic circuit, that displays\nthis noise-induced stabilization effect.

This raises the question about the dominant emission mechanisms in the\nhigh-energy domain. Spectral analysis allows us to put constraints on the\npossible emission processes. Here we study the hard X-ray emission as measured\nby INTEGRAL in the 3-1000 keV energy range, in order to distinguish between a\nthermal and non-thermal inverse Compton process. The hard X-ray spectrum of Cen\nA shows a significant cut-off at energies Ec = 434 (+106 -73) keV with an\nunderlying power law of photon index 1.73 +- 0.02. A more physical model of\nthermal Comptonisation (compPS) gives a plasma temperature of kT = 206+-62 keV\nwithin the optically thin corona with Compton parameter y = 0.42 (+0.09 -0.06).\nThe reflection component is significant at the 1.9 sigma level with R = 0.12\n(+0.09 -0.10), and a reflection strength R>0.3 can be excluded on a 3 sigma\nlevel.

The analysis of the\nSPI data provides no sign of significant emission from the radio lobes and\ngives a 3 sigma upper limit of f(40-1000 keV) < 0.0011 ph/cm**2/s. While\ngamma-rays, as detected by CGRO and Fermi, are caused by non-thermal (jet)\nprocesses, the main process in the hard X-ray emission of Cen A is still not\nunambiguously determined, being either dominated by thermal inverse Compton\nemission, or by non-thermal emission from the base of the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 13:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 13:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

As equilibration means an increase of entropy, the mechanism can\nalso be considered responsible for entropy production. Theoretical treatments\nshow a remarkable agreement with experiments. They rest upon the assumption of\nstochastic quantum transitions. Under this premise, master equations have been\nused that are known to deliver equilibria and entropy production.\n  Here we examine the hypothesis that the ubiquitous inelastic interactions in\ngas and liquid phase may represent a source of entropy beyond chemical\nreactions, rotational activation/deactivation being the prevailing mechanism in\ngas dynamics at room temperature. For a quantum mechanical two-state model the\nmaster equations are formulated which yield entropy production and\nequilibration in translational degrees of freedom until, at conserved energy, a\nstationary Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is reached.\n  The relaxation rates show features that can be checked by monitoring thermal\nrelaxation in gas phase. Depending on the composition, first or second order\nprocesses are predicted. The temperature dependence is determined by the\nactivation energy of the lowest transition. Thus, experimental verification\nwill allow to decide to which extent this hypothesis describes thermal\nrelaxation. It would support a connection between the macroscopic second law of\nthermodynamics and the microscopic stochastic collapse in quantum mechanics,\nboth experimentally secured facts which in theory emerge as special elements\nbeyond Hamiltonian dynamics.\n  It is also shown that inelastic collisions are connected with\nvelocity-dependent forces and result in a new analog of the Fokker-Planck\nequation where they replace Langevin dynamics as a non-Hamiltonian dissipative\nmechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 14:32:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2011 17:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 13:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-12"}

The spin orientation and\npropagation direction of such helical edge states are inherently connected,\nproviding protection against backscattering. However, these features conversely\nrender controlled spin operations such as spin switching difficult. Here we\ntherefore propose constrictions as connectors between opposite edge (and spin)\nstates in HgTe. We demonstrate how the coupling between edge states, which\noverlap in the constriction, can be employed both for steering the charge flow\ninto different edge modes and for controlled spin switching. This gives rise to\na three-state charge and spin transistor function. Unlike in a conventional\nspin transistor, the switching does not rely on a tunable Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction, but on the energy dependence of the edge state wavefunctions.\nBased on this mechanism, and supported by numerical transport calculations, we\npresent two different ways to control spin- and charge-currents depending on\nthe gating of the constriction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 15:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-26"}

Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (J.\nLogic Comput. 13, 2003), extends Dung's framework.

For short-duration transient signals (with pulse widths $\\la$100 \\us),\nthe limiting peak flux density is 100 mJy, which would correspond to a\n5-$\\sigma$ detection of bright giant pulses ($\\sim$20 kJy) from Crab-like\npulsars if located at the distance of M33. We discuss the implications of our\nnull results for various source populations within the galaxy and comment on\nthe future prospects to conduct even more sensitive searches with the upcoming\nnext-generation instruments including the Square Kilometer Array and its\npathfinders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 04:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
