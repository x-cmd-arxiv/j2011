The travel lengths exhibit an exponential\ndistribution rather than a power law with an exponential cutoff as previous\nstudies illustrated.

The identification of the carriers of diffuse interstellar bands\n(DIBs) remains one of the long-standing mysteries in astronomy. The detection\nof a polarisation signal in a DIB profile can be used to distinguish between a\ndust or gas-phase carrier. The polarisation profile can give additional\ninformation on the grain or molecular properties of the absorber. In order to\ndetect and measure the linear and circular polarisation of the DIBs we observed\nreddened lines of sight showing continuum polarisation. For this study we\nselected two stars HD 197770 and HD 194279. We used high-resolution (R~64.000)\nspectropolarimetry in the wavelength range from 3700 to 10480 Angstrom with the\nESPaDOnS echelle spectrograph mounted at the CFHT.\n  Results. High S/N and high resolution Stokes V (circular), Q and U (linear)\nspectra were obtained. We constrained upper limits by a factor of 10 for\npreviously observed DIBs. Furthermore, we analysed ~30 additional DIBs for\nwhich no spectropolarimetry data has been obtained before. This included the\n9577 A DIB and the 8621 A DIB.\n  Conclusions. The lack of polarisation in 45 DIB profiles suggests that none\nof the absorption lines is induced by a grain-type carrier. The strict upper\nlimits, less than ~0.01%, derived for the observed lines-of-sight imply that if\nDIBs are due to gas-phase molecules these carriers have polarisation\nefficiencies which are at least 6 times, and up to 300 times, smaller than\nthose predicted for grain-related carriers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2011 17:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-11"}

Our approach is based on a\nquantum description of the electron spin in combination with the coherent\nsemiclassical dynamics of nuclear spins. We consider single and double\nLandau-Zener passages across the $S$-$T_{+}$ anticrossings.

In this paper, we investigate whether dark energy\nmodels whose ESS are epoch dependent leaves any distinct imprints on the large\nscale CDM power spectrum. In particular, we compare the cases where the ESS is\ndecreasing with time with those where it increases. The CDM power spectrum is\nfound to be generically suppressed in these cases as compared to the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. The degree of suppression at different length scales can,\nin principle, reflect the evolving nature of the ESS of dark energy. However,\nwe find that the effect on the CDM power spectrum in cases where the ESS of\ndark energy is evolving with constant EOS parameter is significantly smaller as\ncompared to the situation where ESS is constant whereas EOS parameter is\nevolving. Further, it is also shown that the effect of different evolution of\nESS for a given evolution of EOS parameter of dark energy on the CDM power\nspectrum is significant only at the intermediate scales (around $k \\sim\n0.01h/Mpc$). At scales much smaller and larger than the Hubble radius, it is\nthe evolution of EOS parameter of dark energy which governs the degree of\nsuppression of CDM power spectrum with respect to the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2011 08:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-26"}

We tested technique of immobilisation\non a substrate for free single-stranded RNA molecules in an extended state.\nUsing AFM we visualised stages of processes of RNA release from protein coat of\ntobacco mosaic virus particles. The asymmetry of this process regarding two\nends of a macromolecule was confirmed. The dynamics of compaction for DNA T4\nmolecules was traced using AFM in real time regime. The partially compacted\nmacromolecules were clearly resolved. We detected that the partially compacted\nstructures consisted of toroidal parts formed by different macromolecular\nstrands. The real geometry of the compacted structures was reconstructed on the\nbasis of systematic AFM measurements. That allowed us to calculate the amount\nof molecules combining each condensed DNA particle. We demonstrated clear\nbenefits of horizontal deposition method for formation of LB films. Using AFM\nwe achieved molecular resolution for some thin film coating and detected\nlattice parameters with the precision determined by the errors within a few\npercent.
