We derive an empirical calibration of the apparent\nluminosities of Cepheids as measured from the optical through the mid-infrared\n(0.45-8.0um) as a function of spectroscopic [Fe/H] abundances of individual\nCepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud from Romaniello et al. (2008). The\ncumulative trend over the entire wavelength range shows a nearly monotonic\nbehavior. The sense of the trend is consistent with differential\nline-blanketing in the optical, leading to stars of high metallicity being\nfainter in the optical. This is followed by a reversal in the trend at longer\nwavelengths, with the cross-over occurring near the K band at about 2.2um,\nconsistent with a subsequent redistribution of energy resulting in a mild\nbrightening of Cepheids (with increased metallicity) at mid-infrared\nwavelengths. This conclusion agrees with that of Romaniello et al. based on a\ndifferential comparison of the mean V- and K-band Leavitt Laws for the Galaxy,\nSMC and LMC, but is opposite in sign to most other empirical tests of the\nsensitivity of Cepheid distances to mean [O/H] HII region abundances. We also\nsearch for a correlation of Cepheid host-galaxy metallicity with deviations of\nthe galaxy's Cepheid distance from that predicted from a pure Hubble flow.\nBased on Cepheid distances to 26 nearby galaxies in the local flow, only a very\nweak signal is detected giving Dmu_o = -0.17 (+/- 0.31) ([O/H] - 8.80) - 0.21\n(+/-0.10).

To apply them to the simulation of medium-modified\njets in heavy ion collisions, a probabilistic implementation of medium-induced\nquantum interference effects is needed. Here, we analyze in detail how the\nquantum interference effects included in the BDMPS-Z formalism of\nmedium-induced gluon radiation can be implemented in a quantitatively\ncontrolled, local probabilistic parton cascade. The resulting MC algorithm is\nformulated in terms of elastic and inelastic mean free paths, and it is by\nconstruction insensitive to the IR and UV divergences of the total elastic and\ninelastic cross sections that serve as its basic building blocks in the\nincoherent limit. Interference effects are implemented by reweighting gluon\nproduction histories as a function of the number of scattering centers that act\nwithin the gluon formation time. Unlike existing implementations based on gluon\nformation time, we find generic arguments for why a quantitative implementation\nof quantum interference cannot amount to a mere dead-time requirement for\nsubsequent gluon production. We validate the proposed MC algorithm by comparing\nMC simulations with parametric dependencies and analytical results of the\nBDMPS-Z formalism. In particular, we show that the MC algorithm interpolates\ncorrectly between analytically known limiting cases for totally coherent and\nincoherent gluon production, and that it accounts quantitatively for the\nmedium-induced gluon energy distribution and the resulting average parton\nenergy loss. We also verify that the MC algorithm implements the transverse\nmomentum broadening of the BDMPS-Z formalism. We finally discuss why the\nproposed MC algorithm provides a suitable starting point for going beyond the\napproximations of the BDMPS-Z formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2011 17:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 14:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-03"}

The 0.3-10 kev continuum, well described by a\npower-law (Gamma ~ 1.86) and two blackbodies (kT ~ 0.085 and 0.22 kev), is\nfound to be affected by a neutral partial covering absorption (N_H ~ 10^{23}\nper cm square, covering fraction ~ 0.22) and two warm absorber components. We\nidentify a low ionisation, xi ~ 20 erg-cm/sec, and high outflow velocity, v ~\n1350 km/s, phase producing the OVI and Fe M-shell unresolved-transition array\n(UTA). An additional high ionisation warm absorbing phase with xi ~ 500\nerg-cm/sec and low outflow velocity, v ~ 540 km/s, gives rise to absorption\nfeatures due to OVII, OVIII, NVI, NVII and CVI. We also detected signatures of\nweak emission lines of He-like triplets from OVII and NVI ions. The emission\nlines are well described by two warm emitting, photoionised media with\ndifferent densities but comparable xi, suggesting discrete clouds of warm\nemission. The high density phase (n_e ~ 10^{13} per cc) responsible for the\nresonance lines appears to outflow at high velocity ~ 5000 km/s. The low\nvelocity, low density phase is likely similar to the X-ray line emitting\nregions found in Seyfert 2 galaxies. The physical conditions of warm emitters\nand warm absorbers suggest that these clouds are similar but observed in\nabsorption along our line of sight and in emission at other lines of sight. The\nunique line of sight passing close to the torus opening angle is likely\nresponsible for the neutral partial covering absorption and our view of\nemission lines due to the suppressed continuum in this polar scattered Seyfert\n1 galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2011 18:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We compare the experimental data to the most recent theoretical\ncalculations that incorporate a variety of physics mechanisms including gluon\nsaturation, gluon shadowing, initial-state parton energy loss, cold nuclear\nmatter breakup, color screening, and charm recombination.

Possible candidates include massive, metal-rich stars, early\ngenerations of massive stars, intermediate or low mass stars and Asymptotic\nGiant Branch (AGB) stars.

The abundance ratios of carbon over\noxygen and nitrogen over oxygen that we find are high compared to the ratios in\nthe stars in the disk of our Galaxy.

Therefore we favour low-and intermediate mass\nstars as sources of these elements.

With\nimproved sensitivity, and the detection of weaker sources, we can explore the\nidea that the spectral trends are a result of the same physical quantities\ncontrolling the emission of non-jetted sources: the black hole mass and the\naccretion rate. This is based on recent results on sources showing a thermal\ncomponent in their spectrum, besides a non-thermal continuum. That the jet\npower should be linked to accretion is intriguing.

We simulate planetary system evolution around Sun-like stars from\ninitial conditions that comprise: an inner disk of planetesimals and planetary\nembryos, three giant planets at Jupiter-Saturn distances, and a massive outer\nplanetesimal disk. We then calculate dust production rates and debris disk SEDs\nassuming that each planetesimal particle represents an ensemble of smaller\nbodies in collisional equilibrium.

Strong giant planet instabilities destroy all rocky material -\nincluding fully-formed terrestrial planets if the instabilities occur late -\nalong with the icy planetesimals.

It takes into\naccount both galaxy evolution and the perturbing effects of large scale\nstructure. The key to the algorithm is a maximum likelihood (ML) method for\njointly estimating both the luminosity function (LF) and the overdensity as a\nfunction of redshift. The random catalogue algorithm then works by cloning each\ngalaxy in the original catalogue, with the number of clones determined by the\nML solution. Each of these cloned galaxies is then assigned a random redshift\nuniformly distributed over the accessible survey volume, taking account of the\nsurvey magnitude limit(s) and, optionally, both luminosity and number density\nevolution. The resulting random catalogues, which can be employed in\ntraditional estimates of galaxy clustering, make fuller use of the information\navailable in the original catalogue and hence are superior to simply fitting a\nfunctional form to the observed redshift distribution. They are particularly\nwell suited to studies of the dependence of galaxy clustering on galaxy\nproperties as each galaxy in the random catalogue has the same list of\nattributes as measured for the galaxies in the genuine catalogue. The\nderivation of the joint overdensity and LF estimator reveals the limit in which\nthe ML estimate reduces to the standard 1/Vmax LF estimate, namely when one\nmakes the prior assumption that the are no fluctuations in the radial\noverdensity. The new ML estimator can be viewed as a generalization of the\n1/Vmax estimate in which Vmax is replaced by a density corrected Vdc,max.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2011 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 13:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

One potential solution to\nthese prosaic concerns is to encode and process the information using\ntopological manipulations of so-called anyons, particles in two dimensions with\nnon-Abelian statistics. Unfortunately, practical implementation of such a\ntopological system remains far from complete, both in terms of physical methods\nbut also in terms of connecting the underlying topological field theory with a\nspecific physical model, including the imperfections expected in any realistic\ndevice.

Our\ndata provide a detailed example of how covering such a broad range in\nwavelength provides a powerful tool for constraining the physical properties of\nstellar populations. The deepest data reach the ancient red clump at M_F814W\n-0.2.

Its relatively hard spectrum without a cut\noff, together with the observed variability on timescale of ~10 min challenges\nstandard emission models. If the emission originates in a portion of the\nrelativistic jet located inside the BLR, severe absorption of gamma rays above\nfew tens of GeV is expected due to the pair production process. These\nobservations imply the existence of a very compact (R_b ~5 x 10^{14} cm) and\nvery fast blob located far beyond the BLR radius, responsible for the rapidly\nvarying high energy flux. However the long term (days-weeks) coherent evolution\nof the GeV flux recorded by LAT indicates that there could be also the\nsubstantial contribution from another larger emission region. We model the\nspectral energy distribution of PKS 1222+216 during the epoch of the MAGIC\ndetection assuming three different scenarios,: (1) a one-zone model considering\nonly the emission from a compact blob outside the BLR; (2) a two-zone model\nconsidering the compact blob plus an emitting region filling the whole jet\ncross-section located outside the BLR and (3) a two zone model with the jet\nemitting region inside the BLR. We find that in all cases the high-energy\nemission from the compact blob is dominated by the inverse Compton scattering\nof the IR thermal radiation of the dusty torus. Both regions are matter\ndominated, with a negligible Poynting flux. These results disfavor models in\nwhich the compact blob is the result of reconnection events inside the jet or\n\"needles\" of high-energy electrons.

The key feature of our model is that it captures peer effects and\ncomplementarities using utility functions, rather than traditional preference\nordering.

The upconverters in\nthis study are based on triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) between excited\npolycyclic aromatic molecules, and TTA requires a fluidic media to allow for\nthe molecules to collide with each other for energy transfer. This process,\nTTA-based photon upconversion (TTA-UC), was therefore mainly accomplished with\norganic solvents previously. It is found that the molecules used for TTA-UC,\nwhich are non-polar or weakly polar, are stably solvated in a certain class of\nILs. The mechanism of the observed solvation is proposed and discussed. The\nupconversion quantum yields (UC-QYs) measured by continuous wave (CW) light\nexcitation reach as high as 10 % with moderate excitation intensity (~ 6\nW/cm2), which is considerably higher than those in previous TTA-UC studies\nperformed with organic solvents (up to ~ 4 % with CW light excitations). It is\nfound that the value of UC-QY starts to saturate as the excitation power\nincreases for all the cases, even within the moderate CW excitation power range\nin this study. An analytical model that describes the UC-QY vs. excitation\npower relationship is derived and compared with the experimental results. The\nagreement between them suggests that the donor-acceptor energy transfer in this\nsystem is highly efficient. Based on these experimental and analytical\nfindings, it is found that efficient energy transfer between the molecules is\npossible in ILs and therefore ILs are not actually viscous media for the\npurpose of TTA-UC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 00:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

For the first time, a search is performed over the\nentire parameter space of energy, direction and time looking for neutrino\nflares of 20 microseconds to a year duration from astrophysical sources among\nthe atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds. Searches which integrate over\ntime are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a larger\nbackground of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the time\nconstraint. Flaring sources considered here, such as active galactic nuclei,\nsoft gamma-ray repeaters and gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidate neutrino\nemitters. We used mainly data taken between April 5, 2008 and May 20, 2009 by a\npartially completed configuration of IceCube with 40 strings. For the presented\nsearches an unbinned maximum likelihood method is used with a time-dependent\nprior to test several different source hypotheses. An \"untriggered\" search\ncovers any possible time-dependent emission from sources not correlated to any\nother observation using other astrophysical messengers such as photons.\nMoreover, a similar time scan is performed for a predefined catalogue of\nsources that exhibit intense photon flares. Searches triggered by\nmulti-wavelength information on flares from blazars and soft gamma-ray\nrepeaters are performed using the 40 string data and also the data taken by the\nprevious configuration of 22 strings in operation between May 31, 2007 and\nApril 5, 2008. Flares for which extensive and continuous monitoring is\navailable from Fermi-LAT and SWIFT and flares detected by imaging Cherenkov\ntelescopes with shorter time-scale monitoring are considered.

The origin of the observed disk-jet coupling also remains\nlargely unknown. X-ray variability studies have revealed complex variability in\nthe accretion flow onto stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, on\ntimescales as short as milliseconds. The detection of correlated broad-band\nrapid time variability in the jet emission would provide valuable information\non how the variability is transferred along the jet and on the timescales of\nphysical processes operating in these jets, ultimately helping to constrain\ninternal jet physics, probe disk-jet coupling and infer accretion geometry. In\nrecent years there have been indirect evidences for optical fast variability\narising from a powerful jet. However, in optical light the emission from the\nouter disk can strongly contaminate the jet signal, resulting in an ambiguous\nidentification of the source of the variability. On the other hand, at much\nlonger wavelengths the variability, coming from far out in the jet, will be\nsmeared out in time. Infrared variability studies are thus ideal for looking at\njet variability on the fastest possible timescales. Thanks to newly available\ndetectors and fast-readout modes, fast infrared and mid-infrared photometry is\nnow possible. This is opening a new exciting window to study the geometry and\nthe Physics of relativistic jets and their connection with the accretion flow.\nHere we present the first results from a large ongoing fast-timing\nmulti-wavelength project, showing the first unambiguous evidence for sub-second\njet variable emission.

In the metallic regime (l_{DH}>l_{DD}), the domains of D-H\npairs overlap with one another, thereby doublons and holons can move\nindependently by exchanging the partners one after another. In contrast, the\nD-D factors give only a minor contribution to the Mott transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 08:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In a D-MAB problem there are $M$ users and $N$ arms (channels)\nthat each offer i.i.d. stochastic rewards with unknown means so long as they\nare accessed without collision. The goal is to design a decentralized online\nlearning policy that incurs minimal regret, defined as the difference between\nthe total expected rewards accumulated by a model-aware genie, and that\nobtained by all users applying the policy. We make two contributions in this\npaper. First, we consider the setting where the users have a prioritized\nranking, such that it is desired for the $K$-th-ranked user to learn to access\nthe arm offering the $K$-th highest mean reward. For this problem, we present\nthe first distributed policy that yields regret that is uniformly logarithmic\nover time without requiring any prior assumption about the mean rewards.\nSecond, we consider the case when a fair access policy is required, i.e., it is\ndesired for all users to experience the same mean reward. For this problem, we\npresent a distributed policy that yields order-optimal regret scaling with\nrespect to the number of users and arms, better than previously proposed\npolicies in the literature. Both of our distributed policies make use of an\ninnovative modification of the well known UCB1 policy for the classic\nmulti-armed bandit problem that allows a single user to learn how to play the\narm that yields the $K$-th largest mean reward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 08:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}

We show the potential to put the\nconstraint on f_{NL} from the number count by future observations such as LOFAR\nand SKA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 11:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Here we describe the beginning of our investigation into\nthe strength of this correlation utilising new multi-line millimeter data from\nthe Mopra CMZ and HOP surveys and multi-wavelength GBT radio continuum\nobservations towards the CMZ and compare these in detail with the diffuse TeV\ngamma-ray emission from HESS. The benefit of these new data is that they allow\nus to simultaneously observe and analyse correlations using a large number\n(>10) of molecular species, some of which contain their isotopologue pairs. The\nuse of isotopologue pairs is especially powerful, since it allows one to\nanalyse the optical depth of a number of different molecular species, thus\ninvestigating the nature of the correlation over a range of different physical\nconditions. Here we begin by comparing the integrated line emission and\ncontinuum radio emission with the diffuse gamma-ray emission, and, by using\nisotopologue pairs such as HCN/H$^{13}$CN, obtain optical depths throughout the\nCMZ corresponding to regions of both strong and weak gamma-ray emission. We\nfind that the radio continuum better matches the peak of the gamma-ray\nemission, which corresponds to the more compact -- compared to the relatively\ncoarse resolution of the gamma-ray images -- sources in the CMZ. Using the\nisotopologue pairs, we find that the optical depth at all positions and\nvelocities within the CMZ are about 2--4. This is similar to that found for the\nCS(1--0) line and would underestimate the mass of the CMZ, potentially\nexplaining why molecular line emission peaks appear offset from the gamma-ray\npeaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 12:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}

Using cosmological resimulations of\na galaxy cluster, we study the evolution of its intracluster medium (ICM) gas\nproperties, and through them we assess the effect of different (sub-grid)\nmodelling of the physical processes at play, namely gas cooling, star\nformation, feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN). More\nspecifically we show that AGN feedback plays a major role in the pre-heating of\nthe proto-cluster as it prevents a high concentration of mass from collecting\nin the center of the future galaxy cluster at early times. However, AGN\nactivity during the cluster's later evolution is also required to regulate the\nmass flow into its core and prevent runaway star formation in the central\ngalaxy. Whereas the energy deposited by supernovae alone is insufficient to\nprevent an overcooling catastrophe, supernovae are responsible for spreading a\nlarge amount of metals at high redshift, enhancing the cooling efficiency of\nthe ICM gas. As the AGN energy release depends on the accretion rate of gas\nonto its central black hole engine, the AGN responds to this supernova enhanced\ngas accretion by injecting more energy into the surrounding gas, and as a\nresult increases the amount of early pre-heating. We demonstrate that the\ninteraction between an AGN jet and the ICM gas that regulates the growth of the\nAGN's BH, can naturally produce cool core clusters if we neglect metals.\nHowever, as soon as metals are allowed to contribute to the radiative cooling,\nonly the non cool core solution is produced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 13:47:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 12:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Molecular emission from rotational transitions of H2O\nand OH and ro-vibrational bands of simple organic molecules (CO2, HCN, C2H2) is\ncommon among the sources in the sample. The gas temperatures (200-800 K) and\nemitting areas we derive are consistent with the emission originating in a warm\ndisk atmosphere in the inner planet formation region at radii < 2 AU. The H2O\nemission appears to form under a limited range of excitation conditions, as\nshown by the similarity in relative strengths of H2O features from star to star\nand the narrow range in derived temperature and column density. Emission from\nhighly excited rotational levels of OH is present in all stars; the OH emission\nflux increases with the stellar accretion rate, and the OH/H2O flux ratio shows\na relatively small scatter.

Theoretical models suggest that short-term\ncollective behavior and long-term cultural diversity are mutually excluding,\nsince they require very different levels of social influence. The latter\njointly depends on two factors: the topology of the underlying social network\nand the overlap between individuals in multidimensional cultural space.\nHowever, while the empirical properties of social networks are well understood,\nlittle is known about the large-scale organization of real societies in\ncultural space, so that random input specifications are necessarily used in\nmodels. Here we use a large dataset to perform a high-dimensional analysis of\nthe scientific beliefs of thousands of Europeans. We find that inter-opinion\ncorrelations determine a nontrivial ultrametric hierarchy of individuals in\ncultural space, a result unaccessible to one-dimensional analyses and in\nstriking contrast with random assumptions. When empirical data are used as\ninputs in models, we find that ultrametricity has strong and counterintuitive\neffects, especially in the extreme case of long-range online-like interactions\nbypassing social ties. On short time-scales, it strongly facilitates a\nsymmetry-breaking phase transition triggering coordinated social behavior. On\nlong time-scales, it severely suppresses cultural convergence by restricting it\nwithin disjoint groups. We therefore find that, remarkably, the empirical\ndistribution of individuals in cultural space appears to optimize the\ncoexistence of short-term collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity,\nwhich can be realized simultaneously for the same moderate level of mutual\ninfluence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 14:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

We used the VLA in multiple configurations to produce high\nresolution radio images of IC443 at 74 and 330 MHz. The changes with position\nin the radio spectral index were correlated with data in near infrared from\n2MASS, in gamma-rays from VERITAS, and with the molecular 12^CO line emission.\nThe new image at 74 MHz has HPBW=35\", rms=30 mJy/beam and at 330 MHz HPBW= 17\"\nand rms=1.7 mJy/beam. The integrated flux densities for the whole SNR are\nS_74MHz=470+/-51 Jy and S_330MHz=248+/-15 Jy. For the pulsar wind nebula\nassociated with the compact source CXOUJ061705.3+222127, we calculated\nS_330MHz=0.23+/-0.05 Jy, S_1420MHz=0.20+/-0.04 Jy, and alpha~0.0. Substantial\nvariations are observed in spectral index between 74 and 330 MHz across IC443.\nThe flattest spectral components (-0.25< alpha<-0.05) coincide with the\nbrightest parts of the SNR along the eastern border, with an impressive\nagreement with ionic lines as observed in the 2MASS J and H bands. This result\nstrongly suggests that the passage of a fast dissociating J-type shock across\nthe interacting molecular cloud dissociated the molecules and ionized the gas.\nWe therefore conclude that thermal absorption at 74 MHz is responsible for the\nlocalized spectral index flattening observed along the eastern border of IC443.\nThe diffuse interior of IC443 has a spectrum steeper than found anywhere in the\nSNR (-0.85<alpha<-0.6), while the southern ridge again has a flatter spectrum\n(alpha -0.4), consequence in this case of the strong shock/molecular cloud\ninteraction. At the available statistics the VERITAS gamma-ray emission\nstrikingly matches the CO distribution, but no clear evidence is found for a\nmorphological correlation between the TeV distribution and radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 15:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In this study we follow the temporal development\nwithin a periodic computational box and concentrate on flows that are\nsub-Alfvenic on the cylindrical jet's axis. Displacement of the initial\nforce-free helical magnetic field leads to the growth of CD kink instability.\nWe find that helically distorted density structure propagates along the jet\nwith speed and flow structure dependent on the radius of the velocity shear\nsurface relative to the characteristic radius of the helically twisted\nforce-free magnetic field. At small velocity shear surface radius the plasma\nflows through the kink with minimal kink propagation speed. The kink\npropagation speed increases as the velocity shear radius increases and the kink\nbecomes more embedded in the plasma flow. A decreasing magnetic pitch profile\nand faster flow enhance the influence of velocity shear. Simulations show\ncontinuous transverse growth in the nonlinear phase of the instability. The\ngrowth rate of the CD kink instability and the nonlinear behavior also depend\non the velocity shear surface radius and flow speed, and the magnetic pitch\nradial profile. Larger velocity shear radius leads to slower linear growth,\nmakes a later transition to the nonlinear stage, and with larger maximum\namplitude than occur for a static plasma column. However, when the velocity\nshear radius is much greater than the characteristic radius of the helical\nmagnetic field, linear and non-linear development can be similar to the\ndevelopment of a static plasma column.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 01:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
