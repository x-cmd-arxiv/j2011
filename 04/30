Traditionally, a spherical harmonics decomposition of\nthe magnetogram is used to construct the current and divergence free magnetic\nfield solution. This method works reasonably well when the order of spherical\nharmonics is limited to be small relative to the resolution of the magnetogram,\nalthough some artifacts, such as ringing, can arise around sharp features. When\nthe number of spherical harmonics is increased, however, using the raw\nmagnetogram data given on a grid that is uniform in the sine of the latitude\ncoordinate can result in inaccurate and unreliable results, especially in the\npolar regions close to the Sun.\n  We discuss here two approaches that can mitigate or completely avoid these\nproblems: i) Remeshing the magnetogram onto a grid with uniform resolution in\nlatitude, and limiting the highest order of the spherical harmonics to the\nanti-alias limit; ii) Using an iterative finite difference algorithm to solve\nfor the potential field. The naive and the improved numerical solutions are\ncompared for actual magnetograms, and the differences are found to be rather\ndramatic.\n  We made our new Finite Difference Iterative Potential-field Solver (FDIPS) a\npublically available code, so that other researchers can also use it as an\nalternative to the spherical harmonics approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 16:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-02"}

Their reality can be interpreted as\nevidence of supermassive black-hole encounters in a previous aeon, as predicted\nby conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) [2]. Counter arguments [4-6] pointed out\nthat such circles arise, at similar frequency, also in simulated data using\nWMAP's CMB power spectrum, plus random input. We responded [7] that if such\ncircles contribute to CMB, this influences the power spectrum, enhancing such\ncircles in simulations. We confirm this here, but show that if the theoretical\nLCDM power spectrum is used instead, then the low-variance circles disappear.\nThis is evidence that the LCDM model gives an incomplete explanation of the\nCMB, missing crucial information, which is provided by incorporating\nlow-variance circles of CCC. The excellent agreement between theoretical LCDM\nand observed power spectrum, even for fairly large l-values, does not reveal\nthis discrepancy, of relevance only at larger l-values where agreement is weak.\nWe point out various non-random aspects of the circles, seen both in the true\ndata and in simulations with WMAP power spectrum, but not with the theoretical\nLCDM spectrum. We also show the spatial distribution of concentric circle sets\nto be very non-random in the true WMAP data (perhaps owing to large-scale mass\ninhomogeneities distorting CCC's circle shapes), in complete contrast with\nsimulations with WMAP power spectrum, where such circle sets are much sparser\nand closer to average temperature. These features are fully consistent with CCC\n(and with an earlier analysis [8] that the random Gaussian component in the CMB\nis only around 0.2 in the total CMB signal) but do not readily fit in with the\nrandom initial fluctuations of standard inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 16:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-04"}

Since the interior of neutron stars has high pressure and as their\nmass and radius can be measured observationally, they are the perfect\nlaboratory for testing the validity of the aether theory. In this paper, we\nsolve the equations of stellar structure for the gravitational aether theory\nand find the predicted mass-radius relation of non-rotating neutron stars using\ntwo different realistic proposals for the equation of state of nuclear matter.\nWe find that the maximum neutron star mass predicted by the aether theory is\n12% - 16% less than the maximum mass predicted by general relativity assuming\nthese two equations of state.

Due to the randomness of the appearance of licensed users,\ndisruptions to both licensed and unlicensed communications are often difficult\nto prevent. In this chapter, a proactive spectrum handoff framework for CR ad\nhoc networks is proposed to address these concerns.

One of the main challenges in dynamic spectrum\naccess is to determine when the \\emph{secondary} (unlicensed) users can use the\nspectrum. In particular, when the secondary user is using the spectrum, if the\nprimary user becomes active to use the spectrum, it is usually hard for the\nsecondary user to detect the primary user instantaneously, thus causing\nunexpected interference and delay to primary users. The secondary user cannot\ndetect the presence of primary users instantaneously because the secondary user\nis unable to detect the spectrum at the same time while it is transmitting. To\nsolve this problem, we propose the full duplex wireless communications scheme\nfor CRNs. In particular, we employ the Antennas Cancellation (AC), the RF\nInterference Cancellation (RIC), and the Digital Interference Cancellation\n(DIC) techniques for secondary users so that the secondary user can scan for\nactive primary users while it is transmitting. Once detecting the presence of\nprimary users, the secondary user will release the spectrum instantaneously to\navoid the interference and delay to primary users. We analyze the packet loss\nrate of primary users in wireless full duplex CRNs, and compare them with the\npacket loss rate of primary users in wireless half duplex CRNs.

Almost all of the estimators are devoted to the tree\ntopology despite the general topology is more common in practice. There has\nbeen few likelihood function devoted to the general topology, not to mention\nthe estimator. To overcome this, two sets of sufficient statistics for the tree\nand general topologies, respectively, are proposed in this paper.

Distance ladder work at mid-infrared wavebands, where dust\neffects are negligible and metallicity correlations are minimized, have been\nlargely focused on few-epoch Cepheid studies. Here we present the first\ndetermination of mid-infrared period-luminosity (PL) relations of RR Lyrae\nstars from phase-resolved imaging using the preliminary data release of the\nWide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We present a novel statistical\nframework to predict posterior distances of 76 well-observed RR Lyrae that uses\nthe optically constructed prior distance moduli while simultaneously imposing a\npower-law PL relation to WISE-determined mean magnitudes. We find that the\nabsolute magnitude in the bluest WISE filter is M_W1 = (-0.421+-0.014) -\n(1.681+-0.147)*log(P/0.50118 day), with no evidence for a correlation with\nmetallicity. Combining the results from the three bluest WISE filters, we find\nthat a typical star in our sample has a distance measurement uncertainty of\n0.97% (statistical) plus 1.17% (systematic). We do not fundamentalize the\nperiods of RRc stars to improve their fit to the relations. Taking the\nHipparcos-derived mean V-band magnitudes, we use the distance posteriors to\ndetermine a new optical metallicity-luminosity relation which we present in\nSection 5. The results of this analysis will soon be tested by HST parallax\nmeasurements and, eventually, with the Gaia astrometric mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2011 07:44:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 19:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Unfortunately, all of the maximum\nlikelihood estimators need to use an iterative procedure to search the solution\nspace for the maximum or to solve a high degree polynomial. An iterative\nprocedure can be computationally expensive and may even converge to a local\nmaximum.

The promise of\ndecentralization is complete freedom for end-users from any service providers\nboth in terms of keeping privacy about content and communication, and also from\nany form of censorship. However decentralization introduces many challenges.\nOne of the principal problems is to guarantee availability of data even when\nthe data owner is not online, so that others can access the said data even when\na node is offline or down. In this paper, we argue that a pragmatic design\nneeds to explicitly allow for and leverage on system heterogeneity, and provide\nincentives for the resource rich participants in the system to contribute such\nresources. To that end we introduce SuperNova - a super-peer based DOSN\narchitecture. While proposing the SuperNova architecture, we envision a dynamic\nsystem driven by incentives and reputation, however, investigation of such\nincentives and reputation, and its effect on determining peer behaviors is a\nsubject for our future study. In this paper we instead investigate the efficacy\nof a super-peer based system at any time point (a snap-shot of the envisioned\ndynamic system), that is to say, we try to quantify the performance of\nSuperNova system given any (fixed) mix of peer population and strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2011 10:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 13:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-26"}

Asymmetries were studied\nwith an elliptical FDD. Modeling results in an apparent angular FDD diameter of\nW Hya of about (80 +/- 1.2) mas (7.8 AU) between 8 and 10 microns, which\ncorresponds to an about 1.9 times larger diameter than the photospheric one.\nThe diameter gradually increases up to (105 +/- 1.2) mas (10.3 AU) at 12\nmicrons.

As already shown in Del Popolo (2009), the\nslope of density profile of inner halos flattens with decreasing halo mass and\nthe profile is well approximated by a Burkert's profile. The analysis shows\nthat dwarfs who suffered a smaller tidal torquing (consequently having smaller\nangular momentum) are characterized by steeper profiles with respect to dwarfs\nsubject to higher torque, and similarly dwarfs having a smaller baryons\nfraction have also steeper profiles than those having a larger baryon fraction.\nIn the case tidal torquing is shut down and baryons are not present, the\ndensity profile is very well approximated by an Einasto profile, similarly to\ndwarfs obtained in dissipationless N-body simulations.

Hence, for any point of the Thoma simplex, the corresponding\nmeasures on the levels of the Young graph have a property of gaussian\nconcentration. By using the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm and the theory\nof Pitman operators, we relate these results to the properties of certain\nrandom permutations obtained by riffle shuffles, and to the behaviour of random\nwalks conditioned to stay in a Weyl chamber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2011 15:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-03"}

The winner is\nwhoever places the \\emph{lowest} bid, provided that it is also unique. We use a\ngrand canonical approach to derive an analytical expression for the equilibrium\ndistribution of strategies. We then study the properties of the solution as a\nfunction of the mean number of players, and compare them with a large dataset\nof internet auctions. The theory agrees with the data with striking accuracy\nfor small population size $N$, while for larger $N$ a qualitatively different\ndistribution is observed. We interpret this result as the emergence of two\ndifferent regimes, one in which adaptation is feasible and one in which it is\nnot. Our results question the actual possibility of a large population to adapt\nand find the optimal strategy when participating in a collective game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2011 10:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 12:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2012 15:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
