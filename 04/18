This is mainly due to the fact\nthat these norms provide a method for testing whether the maximum correlation\nof a function $f:\\mathbb{F}_p^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_p$ with polynomials of\ndegree at most $d \\le p$ is non-negligible, while making only a constant number\nof queries to the function. This is an instance of {\\em correlation testing}.\nIn this framework, a fixed test is applied to a function, and the acceptance\nprobability of the test is dependent on the correlation of the function from\nthe property. This is an analog of {\\em proximity oblivious testing}, a notion\ncoined by Goldreich and Ron, in the high error regime. In this work, we study\ngeneral properties which are affine invariant and which are correlation\ntestable using a constant number of queries. We show that any such property (as\nlong as the field size is not too small) can in fact be tested by Gowers\nuniformity tests, and hence having correlation with the property is equivalent\nto having correlation with degree $d$ polynomials for some fixed $d$. We stress\nthat our result holds also for non-linear properties which are affine\ninvariant. This completely classifies affine invariant properties which are\ncorrelation testable.

In contrast to three-dimensional\nsystems where the macroscopic screening can be described by a static dielectric\nconstant in 2D systems the macroscopic screening is non local (q-dependent)\nshowing a logarithmic divergence for small distances and reaching the\nunscreened Coulomb potential for large distances. The cross-over of these two\nregimes is dictated by 2D layer polarizability that can be easily computed by\nstandard first-principles techniques. The present results have strong\nimplications for describing gap-impurity levels and also exciton binding\nenergies. The simple model derived here captures the main physical effects and\nreproduces well, for the case of graphane, the full many-body GW plus\nBethe-Salpeter calculations.

The\nresults of our rotation diagram analysis show that the rotation temperatures\nare close to the cosmic microwave background temperature of 5.14 K that we\nexpect to measure at z=0.89, whereas the kinetic temperature is one order of\nmagnitude higher, indicating that the gas is subthermally excited. The\nmolecular fractional abundances are found to be in-between those in typical\nGalactic diffuse and translucent clouds, and clearly deviate from those\nobserved in the dark cloud TMC 1 or in the Galactic center giant molecular\ncloud Sgr B2. The isotopic ratios of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon\ndeviate significantly from the solar values, which can be linked to the young\nage of the z=0.89 galaxy and a release of nucleosynthesis products dominated by\nmassive stars.

Finally, the\nline centroids of several species (e.g., CH3OH, NH3) are found to be\nsignificantly offset from the average velocity.

In general, a feature of random effects logistic\nregression models for longitudinal binary data is that the marginal functional\nform, when integrated over the distribution of the random effects, is no longer\nof logistic form. Recently, Wang and Louis [Biometrika 90 (2003) 765--775]\nproposed a random intercept model in the clustered binary data setting where\nthe marginal model has a logistic form. An acknowledged limitation of their\nmodel is that it allows only a single random effect that varies from cluster to\ncluster.

The proposed model allows for a flexible correlation\nstructure among the random intercepts, where the correlations can be\ninterpreted in terms of Kendall's $\\tau$. For example, the marginal\ncorrelations among the repeated binary outcomes can decline with increasing\ntime separation, while the model retains the property of having matching\nconditional and marginal logit link functions.

The model gives a semi-quantitatively\naccurate description of both the vapor-liquid-solid phase diagram for both\nsimple fluids (Lennard-Jones interactions) and of the\nlow-density/high-density/crystal phase diagram for model globular proteins (ten\nWolde-Frenkel interaction). The density profile is characterized by two local\norder parameters, the average density and the crystallinity. The bulk free\nenergy model is supplemented by squared-derivative terms in these order\nparameters to account for inhomogeneities thus producing a model similar in\nspirit to phase-field theory. It is shown that for both interaction models, the\nvapor-crystal part of the phase-diagram can be separated into regions for which\nmetastable liquid phases are more or less stable than the vapor, but always\nless stable than the solid. The former case allows for the possibility of\n\\emph{double nucleation} whereby liquid droplets nucleate from the vapor\nfollowed by a separate nucleation of the solid phase within the liquid\ndroplets. Whether or not this actually occurs depends on the relative free\nenergy barriers for vapor-solid and vapor-liquid nucleation and it is shown\nthat for simple fluids, double nucleation is indeed favored at sufficiently\nlarge supersaturation. Finally, by studying the minimum free energy path from\nthe vapor to the solid, the separate possibility of \\emph{transient\nnucleation}, where the vapor-solid transition involves a single nucleation\nevent but the sub-critical clusters tend to be liquid-like while small, is\nshown to also be possible when the metastable liquid exists, but the\nsupersaturation is too small for double nucleation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 08:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The poor convergence of quantum field theory at finite temperature\nhas been the main obstacle in the practical applications of thermal QCD for\ndecades. In this dissertation I apply hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory,\nwhich is a gauge-invariant reorganization of the conventional perturbative\nexpansion for quantum gauge theories to the thermodynamics of QED and\nYang-Mills theory to three-loop order. For the Abelian case, I present a\ncalculation of the free energy of a hot gas of electrons and photons by\nexpanding in a power series in $m_D/T$, $m_f/T$ and $e^2$, where $m_D$ and\n$m_f$ are the photon and electron thermal masses, respectively, and $e$ is the\ncoupling constant. I demonstrate that the hard-thermal-loop perturbation\nreorganization improves the convergence of the successive approximations to the\nQED free energy at large coupling, $e \\sim 2$. For the non-Abelian case, I\npresent a calculation of the free energy of a hot gas of gluons by expanding in\na power series in $m_D/T$ and $g^2$, where $m_D$ is the gluon thermal mass and\n$g$ is the coupling constant. I show that at three-loop order hard-thermal-loop\nperturbation theory is compatible with lattice results for the pressure, energy\ndensity, and entropy down to temperatures $T \\sim 2-3\\;T_c$.

Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) allows the\nanalyst to minimize some cost function while ensuring some minimal performances\ncast as admissible failure probabilities for a set of performance functions. In\norder to address real-world engineering problems in which the performance is\nassessed through computational models (e.g., finite element models in\nstructural mechanics) metamodeling techniques have been developed in the past\ndecade. This paper introduces adaptive Kriging surrogate models to solve the\nRBDO problem. The latter is cast in an augmented space that \"sums up\" the range\nof the design space and the aleatory uncertainty in the design parameters and\nthe environmental conditions. The surrogate model is used (i) for evaluating\nrobust estimates of the failure probabilities (and for enhancing the\ncomputational experimental design by adaptive sampling) in order to achieve the\nrequested accuracy and (ii) for applying a gradient-based optimization\nalgorithm to get optimal values of the design parameters.

We derive an\nexpression for the Mukhanov-Sasaki perturbation variable at the onset of the\ninflationary phase that follows the bounce. Rather than being in the\nBunch-Davies vacuum, it is found to be in an excited state that depends on the\ntime scale of the bounce. We then show that this induces oscillations\nsuperimposed on the nearly scale-invariant primordial spectra for scalar and\ntensor perturbations. We discuss the effects of these oscillations in the\ncosmic microwave background and in the matter power spectrum. We propose a new\nway to indirectly measure the spatial curvature energy density parameter in the\ncontext of this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 14:26:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 09:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

To meet such a coexistence constraint, the\nrelaying from the secondary user (SU) can help the PU's transmission under the\ninterference from the SU. However, the relayed signal in the known dirty paper\ncoding (DPC) based scheme is interfered by the SU's signal, and is not \"clean\".\nIn this paper, under the half-duplex constraints, we propose two new\ntransmission schemes aided by the clean relaying from the SU's transmitter and\nreceiver without interference from the SU. We name them as the clean\ntransmitter relaying (CT) and clean transmitter-receiver relaying (CTR) aided\ncognitive radio, respectively. The rate and multiplexing gain performances of\nCT and CTR in fading channels with various availabilities of the channel state\ninformation at the transmitters (CSIT) are studied. Our CT generalizes the\ncelebrated DPC based scheme proposed previously. With full CSIT, the\nmultiplexing gain of the CTR is proved to be better (or no less) than that of\nthe previous DPC based schemes. This is because the silent period for decoding\nthe PU's messages for the DPC may not be necessary in the CTR. With only the\nstatistics of CSIT, we further prove that the CTR outperforms the rate\nperformance of the previous scheme in fast Rayleigh fading channels. The\nnumerical examples also show that in a large class of channels, the proposed CT\nand CTR provide significant rate gains over the previous scheme with small\ncomplexity penalties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 14:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-24"}

But\nadjacent material planes of alternating permittivity should interact due to the\nzero-point (ZP) field to produce internal forces, roughly like the Casimir\neffect in a stack of regularly spaced discrete conducting plates. The ZP force\nin a smoothly varying 1D permittivity wave is modeled and found to consist\nmainly of bulk repulsive and double-wavenumber harmonics. It is stronger than\nthe Casimir ZP attractive force in the corresponding discrete alternating-layer\nstack at all physically meaningful repetition scales, extends to larger scales,\nfalling off universally only as the inverse square of the wavelength, and shows\nno temperature sensitivity. Thus, at its extremes, a standing acoustic wave\nexhibits a bulk expansive ZP pressure through the material volume, but as it\npasses through its null the ZP pressure vanishes, giving a body stress\nmodulated at twice the acoustic wave frequency. But such repeated tensing in a\npiezo material is a usual energy-harvesting scenario, suggesting that ZP energy\ntransfer may occur naturally with standing acoustic waves in a piezo medium. A\nvoltage effect is predicted for biphonon lattice vibrations in piezo crystals\nwith the possibility of 'crystal power', the extraction of electrical ZP energy\nacross the crystal volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 15:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 15:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}
