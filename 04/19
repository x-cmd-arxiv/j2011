We have built a mixed\ndwarfs+clusters sample containing some of the most promising nearby dwarf\ngalaxies (Draco, Ursa Minor, Wilman 1 and Segue 1) and local galaxy clusters\n(Perseus, Coma, Ophiuchus, Virgo, Fornax, NGC5813 and NGC5846), and then\ncompute their DM annihilation flux profiles by making use of the latest\nmodeling of their DM density profiles. We also include in our calculations the\neffect of DM substructure. Willman 1 appears as the best candidate in the\nsample. However, its mass modeling is still rather uncertain, so probably other\ncandidates with less uncertainties and quite similar fluxes, namely Ursa Minor\nand Segue 1, might be better options. As for galaxy clusters, Virgo represents\nthe one with the highest flux. However, its large spatial extension can be a\nserious handicap for IACT observations and posterior data analysis. Yet, other\nlocal galaxy cluster candidates with more moderate emission regions, such as\nPerseus, may represent good alternatives. After comparing dwarfs and clusters,\nwe found that the former exhibit annihilation flux profiles that, at the\ncenter, are roughly one order of magnitude higher than those of clusters,\nalthough galaxy clusters can yield similar, or even higher, integrated fluxes\nfor the whole object once substructure is taken into account. Even when any of\nthese objects are strictly point-like according to the properties of their\nannihilation signals, we conclude that dwarf galaxies are best suited for\nobservational strategies based on the search of point-like sources, while\ngalaxy clusters represent best targets for analyses that can deal with rather\nextended emissions. Finally, we study the detection prospects for IACTs\n[ABRIDGED]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 16:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2011 07:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 22:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of\nbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are\ngenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical\ngalaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it\ngives a misleading description of ETGs. We study for the first time the\nkinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to\nreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than\nusing classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density\nenvironments [f(SR)<2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR)~4%] of\nthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, with\nthe exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR)~20%].

The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma\nrelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment as\nmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators in\nlow-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local\neffects at the small-group scale.

Significant flux variability on a time scale of several hours was found\nin the optical regime, accompanied by a weak trend of spectral softening with\nincreasing flux. We suggest that this might be the signature of a contribution\nfrom the accretion disk at the blue end of the optical spectrum. The optical\nflux is weakly polarized with rapid variations of the degree and direction of\npolarization, while the polarization of the 43 GHz radio core remains steady.\nOptical spectropolarimetry suggests a trend of increasing degree of\npolarization with increasing wavelength, providing additional evidence for an\naccretion disc contribution towards the blue end of the optical spectrum. We\nconstructed four SEDs indicating that even in the quiescent state, the\nbolometric luminosity of PKS 0528+134 is dominated by its gamma-ray emission. A\nleptonic single-zone jet model produced acceptable fits to the SEDs with\ncontributions to the high-energy emission from synchrotron self-Compton\nradiation and Comptonization of direct accretion disk emission. Fit parameters\nclose to equipartition were obtained. The moderate variability on long time\nscales implies the existence of on-going particle acceleration, while the\nobserved optical polarization variability seems to point towards a turbulent\nacceleration process.

The\nmethod is demonstrated using a model Wind Farm case study, and applied to\ndefining a true physical measure of its energy productivity for society\n(EROI-S), the global ratio of energy produced to energy cost. The traceable\nneeds of business technology are combined with assignable energy needs for all\nother operating services. That serves to correct a large natural gap in energy\nuse information. Current methods count traceable energy receipts for technology\nuse. Self-managing services employed by businesses outsource their own energy\nneeds to operate, and leave no records to trace. Those uncounted energy demands\nare often 80% of the total embodied energy of business end products. The scale\nof this \"dark energy\" was discovered from differing global accounts, and\ncorrected so the average energy cost per dollar for businesses would equal the\nworld average energy use per dollar of GDP. Presently the energy needs of paid\nservices that outsource their own energy needs are counted for lack of\ninformation to be \"0\".

The significant fraction of crystalline material in comets,\nchondritic meteorites and interplanetary dust particles indicates a\nmodification of the almost completely amorphous ISM dust from which they\nformed. The production of crystalline silicates thus must happen in\nprotoplanetary disks, where dust evolves to build planets and planetesimals.\nDifferent scenarios have been proposed, but it is still unclear how and when\nthis happens. This paper presents dust grain mineralogy of a complete sample of\nprotoplanetary disks in the young Serpens cluster. These results are compared\nto those in the young Taurus region and to sources that have retained their\nprotoplanetary disks in the older Upper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis stellar\nclusters, using the same analysis technique for all samples. This comparison\nallows an investigation of the grain mineralogy evolution with time for a total\nsample of 139 disks. The mean cluster age and disk fraction are used as\nindicators of the evolutionary stage of the different populations. Our results\nshow that the disks in the different regions have similar distributions of mean\ngrain sizes and crystallinity fractions (~10-20%) despite the spread in mean\nages. Furthermore, there is no evidence of preferential grain sizes for any\ngiven disk geometry, nor for the mean cluster crystallinity fraction to\nincrease with mean age in the 1-8 Myr range. The main implication is that a\nmodest level of crystallinity is established in the disk surface early on (< 1\nMyr), reaching a equilibrium that is independent of what may be happening in\nthe disk midplane. These results are discussed in the context of planet\nformation, in comparison with mineralogical results from small bodies in our\nSolar System.

Anisotropic heat conduction causes the slow magnetosonic wave to\nbecome buoyantly unstable to the magnetothermal instability (MTI) when the\ntemperature increases in the direction of gravity and to the heat-flux--driven\nbuoyancy instability (HBI) when the temperature decreases in the direction of\ngravity. The local changes in magnetic field strength that attend these\ninstabilities cause pressure anisotropies that viscously damp motions parallel\nto the magnetic field. In this paper we employ a linear stability analysis to\nelucidate the effects of anisotropic viscosity (i.e. Braginskii pressure\nanisotropy) on the MTI and HBI. By stifling the convergence/divergence of\nmagnetic field lines, pressure anisotropy significantly affects how the ICM\ninteracts with the temperature gradient. Instabilities which depend upon the\nconvergence/divergence of magnetic field lines to generate unstable buoyant\nmotions (the HBI) are suppressed over much of the wavenumber space, whereas\nthose which are otherwise impeded by field-line convergence/divergence (the\nMTI) are strengthened. As a result, the wavenumbers at which the HBI survives\nlargely unsuppressed in the ICM have parallel components too small to\nrigorously be considered local. This is particularly true as the magnetic field\nbecomes more and more orthogonal to the temperature gradient. In contrast, the\nfastest-growing MTI modes are unaffected by anisotropic viscosity.

To define gas motions relative to the systemic\nvelocity of the blob, the LyA line must be compared with an optically-thin line\nlike Halpha, which is not much altered by radiative transfer effects. We obtain\noptical and NIR spectra of the two brightest LyA blobs from Yang et al. sample\nusing the Magellan/MagE and VLT/SINFONI. Both the LyA and Halpha lines confirm\nthat these blobs lie at the survey redshift, z~2.3. Within each blob, we detect\nseveral Halpha sources, which roughly correspond to galaxies seen in HST\nimages. The Halpha detections show that these galaxies have large internal\nvelocity dispersions (130 - 190km/s) and that, in the one system (LAB01), their\nvelocity difference is ~440 km/s. The presence of multiple galaxies within the\nblobs, and those galaxies' large velocity dispersions and large relative\nmotion, is consistent with our previous finding that LyA blobs inhabit massive\ndark matter halos that will evolve into those typical of rich clusters today.\nTo determine whether the gas near the embedded galaxies is predominantly\ninfalling or outflowing, we compare the LyA and Halpha line centers, finding\nthat LyA is not offset (Delta LyA = +0km/s) in LAB01 and redshifted by only\n+230 km/s in LAB02. These offsets are small compared to those of Lyman break\ngalaxies, which average +450 km/s and extend to about +700 km/s. We test and\nrule out the simplest infall models and those outflow models with\nsuper/hyper-winds, which require large outflow velocities. Because of the\nunknown geometry of the gas distribution and the possibility of multiple\nsources of LyA emission embedded in the blobs, a larger sample and more\nsophisticated models are required to test more complex or a wider range of\ninfall and outflow scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 21:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Traditionally, this\nproblem is formulated into a utilization maximization problem. The single-path\nrouting scheme fails to react to instantaneous network congestion. Multi-path\nrouting schemes thus have been proposed aiming at improving network efficiency.\nUnfortunately, the natural optimization problem to consider is concave but not\nstrictly concave. It thus brings a huge challenge to design stable multi-path\ncongestion control algorithms.\n  In this paper, we propose a generalized multi-path utility maximization model\nto consider the problem of routes selection and flow control, and derive a\nfamily of multi-path dual congestion control algorithms. We show that the\nproposed algorithms are stable in the absence of delays. We also derive\ndecentralized and scalable sufficient conditions for a particular scheme when\npropagation delays exist in networks. Simulations are implemented using both\nMatlab and NS2, on which evaluation of the proposed multi-path dual algorithms\nis exerted. The comparison results, between the proposed algorithms and the\nother two existing algorithms, show that the proposed multi-path dual\nalgorithms with appropriate parameter settings can achieve a stable aggregated\nthroughput while maintaining fairness among the involved users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 04:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Starting with the\npremise that simulation-based approaches are not affordable for such problems,\nand that the most-probable-failure-point-based approaches do not permit to\nquantify the error on the estimation of the failure probability, an approach\nbased on both metamodels and advanced simulation techniques is explored. The\nkriging metamodeling technique is chosen in order to surrogate the performance\nfunctions because it allows one to genuinely quantify the surrogate error. The\nsurrogate error onto the limit-state surfaces is propagated to the failure\nprobabilities estimates in order to provide an empirical error measure. This\nerror is then sequentially reduced by means of a population-based adaptive\nrefinement technique until the kriging surrogates are accurate enough for\nreliability analysis. This original refinement strategy makes it possible to\nadd several observations in the design of experiments at the same time.\nReliability and reliability sensitivity analyses are performed by means of the\nsubset simulation technique for the sake of numerical efficiency. The adaptive\nsurrogate-based strategy for reliability estimation is finally involved into a\nclassical gradient-based optimization algorithm in order to solve the RBDO\nproblem. The kriging surrogates are built in a so-called augmented reliability\nspace thus making them reusable from one nested RBDO iteration to the other.\nThe strategy is compared to other approaches available in the literature on\nthree academic examples in the field of structural mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 08:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}

We perform radiative transfer\ncalculations on chemical-MHD models to compute X. Using integrated NH2 and W\nreproduces the limited range in X found in observations, resulting in a mean\nvalue X=2\\times10^20 s/cm^2/K^1/km^1 from the Galactic MC model. However, in\nlimited velocity intervals, X can take on a much larger range due to CO line\nsaturation. Thus, X strongly depends on both the range in gas velocities and\nvolume densities. The temperature (T) variations within individual MCs do not\nstrongly affect X, as dense gas contributes most to setting X. For fixed\nvelocity and density structure, gas with higher T has higher W, yielding X ~\nT^-1/2 for T~20-100 K. We demonstrate that the linewidth-size scaling relation\ndoes not influence the X factor - only the range in velocities is important.\nClouds with larger linewidths, regardless of the linewidth-size relation, have\na higher W, corresponding to a lower value of X, scaling roughly as X ~\nsigma^-1/2. The \"mist\" model, consisting of optically thick cloudlets with\nwell-separated velocities, does not accurately reflect the conditions in a\nturbulent MC. We propose that the observed cloud-average values of X ~ XGal is\nsimply a result of the limited range in NH2, temperatures, and velocities found\nin Galactic MCs - a ~constant value of X therefore does not require any\nlinewidth-size relation, or that MCs are virialized objects. Since gas\nproperties likely differ (slightly) between clouds, masses derived through a\nstandard X should only be considered as a rough first estimate. For\ntemperatures T~10-20 K, velocity dispersions ~1-6 km/s, and NH2~2-20\\times10^21\ncm^-2, we find cloud-averaged X ~ 2-4\\times10^20 s/cm^2/K^1/km^1 for\nSolar-metallicity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 10:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The observed object\nmorphology in the near-IR images clearly suggests a young stellar object that\nis embedded in an extended, roughly spherical envelope and surrounded by a\nlarge circumstellar disk with a diameter of ~5500 AU that is seen nearly\nedge-on. The radiative transfer modeling shows that the central object is a\nmassive (10-15 Msun) young stellar object. The circumstellar disk has a mass of\nabout 2 Msun. The disk object in Carina is one of the most massive young\nstellar objects for which a circumstellar disk has been detected so far, and\nthe size and mass of the disk are very large compared to the corresponding\nvalues found for most other similar objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 10:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Comparison of different populations of weighted networks is hard\nbecause topology is inherently dependent on wiring cost, where cost is defined\nas the number of edges in an unweighted graph. In this paper, we evaluate the\nbenefits and limitations associated with using cost-integrated topological\nmetrics. Our focus is on comparing populations of weighted undirected graphs\nusing global efficiency. We evaluate different approaches to the comparison of\nweighted networks that differ in mean association weight. Our key result shows\nthat integrating over cost is equivalent to controlling for any monotonic\ntransformation of the weight set of a weighted graph. That is, when integrating\nover cost, we eliminate the differences in topology that may be due to a\nmonotonic transformation of the weight set. Our result holds for any unweighted\ntopological measure. Cost-integration is therefore helpful in disentangling\ndifferences in cost from differences in topology. By contrast, we show that the\nuse of the weighted version of a topological metric does not constitute a valid\napproach to this problem. Indeed, we prove that, under mild conditions, the use\nof the weighted version of global efficiency is equivalent to simply comparing\nweighted costs. Thus, we recommend the reporting of (i) differences in weighted\ncosts and (ii) differences in cost-integrated topological measures. We\ndemonstrate the application of these techniques in a re-analysis of an fMRI\nworking memory task. Finally, we discuss the limitations of integrating\ntopology over cost, which may pose problems when some weights are zero, when\nmultiplicities exist in the ranks of the weights, and when one expects subtle\ncost-dependent topological differences, which could be masked by\ncost-integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 10:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 05:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The geometrical nature of the entanglement entropy\ncalculation is particularly intriguing when applied to black holes when the\nentangling surface is the black hole horizon.

Firstly, in order to constrain the possible galaxy\ncluster morphologies, the validity of the distance-duality relation (DD\nrelation) is assumed in the $\\Lambda$CDM framework (WMAP7).

This raises the question of whether a similar\nintractability holds for approximate Nash equilibrium without such constraints.\nWe give evidence that the constraint of near-optimal value makes the problem\ndistinctly harder: a simple algorithm finds an optimal 1/2-approximate\nequilibrium, while finding strictly better than 1/2-approximate equilibria is\nas hard as the Hidden Clique problem. This is in contrast to the unconstrained\nproblem where more sophisticated algorithms, achieving better approximations,\nare known.\n  Unlike general Nash equilibrium, which is in PPAD, optimal (maximum value)\nNash equilibrium is NP-hard.

Along with the pairwise\ndeath of predators and growth of preys, we introduce an interaction where the\npredators can eat one of the neighboring prey and reproduce a new predator\nthere instantly. The model shows a non-equilibrium phase transition into a\nunusual absorbing state where predators are absent and the lattice is fully\noccupied by preys. The critical exponents of the system are found to be\ndifferent from that of the Directed Percolation universality class and they are\nrobust against addition of explicit diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 14:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 05:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-02"}

Motivated by experiments where a dusty plasma is heated and then\ncooled suddenly, we track particle motion using a simulation with Langevin\ndynamics. Hysteresis is observed when the temperature is varied rapidly in a\nheating and cooling cycle. As in the experiment, transient solid superheating,\nbut not liquid supercooling, is observed. Solid superheating, which is\ncharacterized by solid structure above the melting point, is found to be\npromoted by a higher rate of temperature increase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 15:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}

Our approach is\nbased on statistical mechanics models and it is developed analytically via\nmean-field techniques. First of all, we show that, when the coupling strength\nis set positive, the model is able to consistently recover all the various\ncooperative measures previously introduced, hence obtaining a single unifying\nframework. Furthermore, we introduce a criterion to discriminate between weak\nand strong cooperativity, based on a measure of \"susceptibility\". We also\nproperly extend the model in order to account for multiple attachments\nphenomena: this is realized by incorporating within the model $p$-body\ninteractions, whose non-trivial cooperative capability is investigated too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 15:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-07"}
