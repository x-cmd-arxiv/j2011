Here we propose an alternative picture where the\nbubbles are the remnants of a large-scale wide-angle outflow from \\sgra, the\nSMBH of our Galaxy. Such an outflow would be a natural consequence of a short\nbut bright accretion event on to \\sgra\\ if it happened concurrently with the\nwell known star formation event in the inner 0.5 pc of the Milky Way $\\sim 6$\nMyr ago. We find that the hypothesised near-spherical outflow is focussed into\na pair of symmetrical lobes by the greater gas pressure along the Galactic\nplane. The outflow shocks against the interstellar gas in the Galaxy bulge.\nGamma--ray emission could be powered by cosmic rays created by either \\sgra\\\ndirectly or accelerated in the shocks with the external medium. The Galaxy disc\nremains unaffected, agreeing with recent observational evidence that\nsupermassive black holes do not correlate with galaxy disc properties. We\nestimate that an accreted mass $\\sim 2 \\times 10^3\\msun$ is needed for the\naccretion event to power the observed {\\it Fermi}--LAT lobes. Within a factor\nof a few this agrees with the mass of the young stars born during the star\nformation event. This estimate suggests that roughly 50% of the gas was turned\ninto stars, while the rest accreted onto \\sgra. One interpretation of this is a\nreduced star formation efficiency inside the \\sgra\\ accretion disc due to\nstellar feedback, and the other a peculiar mass deposition geometry that\nresulted in a significant amount of gas falling directly inside the inner $\\sim\n0.03$ pc of the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 16:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The ionization fraction, in turn, controls the coupling of the\nmagnetic field to the gas and hence the dynamical evolution of the cores. The\npurpose of this work is to compute the attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux rate\nin a cloud core taking into account magnetic focusing, magnetic mirroring, and\nall relevant energy loss processes. We adopt a standard cloud model\ncharacterized by a mass-to-flux ratio supercritical by a factor of about 2 to\ndescribe the density and magnetic field distribution of a low-mass starless\ncore, and we follow the propagation of cosmic rays through the core along flux\ntubes enclosing different amount of mass. We then extend our analysis to cores\nwith different mass-to-flux ratios. We find that mirroring always dominates\nover focusing, implying a reduction of the cosmic-ray ionization rate by a\nfactor of about 2-3 over most of a solar-mass core with respect to the value in\nthe intercloud medium outside the core. For flux tubes enclosing larger masses\nthe reduction factor is smaller, since the field becomes increasingly uniform\nat larger radii and lower densities. We also find that the cosmic-ray\nionization rate is further reduced in clouds with stronger magnetic field, e.g.\nby a factor of about 4 for a marginally critical cloud. The magnetic field\nthreading molecular cloud cores affects the penetration of low-energy cosmic\nrays and reduces the ionization rate by a factor 3-4 depending on the position\ninside the core and the magnetization of the core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 16:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

While there is no consensus on whether MCIs actually \"convert\"\nto AD, the more important question is not whether MCIs convert, but what is the\nbest such definition. We focus on automatic prognostication, nominally using\nonly a baseline image brain scan, of whether an MCI individual will convert to\nAD within a multi-year period following the initial clinical visit. This is in\nfact not a traditional supervised learning problem since, in ADNI, there are no\ndefinitive labeled examples of MCI conversion. Prior works have defined MCI\nsubclasses based on whether or not clinical/cognitive scores such as CDR\nsignificantly change from baseline. There are concerns with these definitions,\nhowever, since e.g. most MCIs (and ADs) do not change from a baseline CDR=0.5,\neven while physiological changes may be occurring. These works ignore rich\nphenotypical information in an MCI patient's brain scan and labeled AD and\nControl examples, in defining conversion. We propose an innovative conversion\ndefinition, wherein an MCI patient is declared to be a converter if any of the\npatient's brain scans (at follow-up visits) are classified \"AD\" by an\n(accurately-designed) Control-AD classifier. This novel definition bootstraps\nthe design of a second classifier, specifically trained to predict whether or\nnot MCIs will convert. This second classifier thus predicts whether an\nAD-Control classifier will predict that a patient has AD. Our results\ndemonstrate this new definition leads not only to much higher prognostic\naccuracy than by-CDR conversion, but also to subpopulations much more\nconsistent with known AD brain region biomarkers.

We found that, when a cluster is surrounded by\na dense DM halo, the positions of the cluster' stars in the H-R diagram have a\nbrighter and hotter turn-off point than in the classical scenario without DM,\ntherefore giving the cluster a younger appearance. The high DM densities\nrequired to produce these effects are expected only in very specific locations,\nsuch as near the center of our Galaxy. In particular, if DM is formed by the 8\nGeV WIMPs recently invoked to reconcile the results from direct detection\nexperiments, then this signature is predicted for halos of DM with a density\nrho_DM = 3 \\cdot 10^5 GeV cm^3. A DM density gradient inside the stellar\ncluster would result in a broader main sequence, turn-off and red giant branch\nregions. Moreover, we found that for very high DM halo densities the bottom of\nthe isochrones in the H-R diagram rises to higher luminosities, leading to a\ncharacteristic signature on the stellar cluster.

In this view a theory is scientific if\nit can be used to build a data compression program, and it is valuable if it\ncan compress a standard benchmark database to a small size, taking into account\nthe length of the compressor itself. This methodology therefore includes an\nOccam principle as well as a solution to the problem of demarcation. Because of\nthe fundamental difficulty of lossless compression, this type of research must\nbe empirical in nature: compression can only be achieved by discovering and\ncharacterizing empirical regularities in the data. Because of this, the\nphilosophy provides a way to reformulate fields such as computer vision and\ncomputational linguistics as empirical sciences: the former by attempting to\ncompress databases of natural images, the latter by attempting to compress\nlarge text databases. The book argues that the rigor and objectivity of the\ncompression principle should set the stage for systematic progress in these\nfields. The argument is especially strong in the context of computer vision,\nwhich is plagued by chronic problems of evaluation.\n  The book also considers the field of machine learning. Here the traditional\napproach requires that the models proposed to solve learning problems be\nextremely simple, in order to avoid overfitting. However, the world may contain\nintrinsically complex phenomena, which would require complex models to\nunderstand. The compression philosophy can justify complex models because of\nthe large quantity of data being modeled (if the target database is 100 Gb, it\nis easy to justify a 10 Mb model). The complex models and abstractions learned\non the basis of the raw data (images, language, etc) can then be reused to\nsolve any specific learning problem, such as face recognition or machine\ntranslation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 18:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-29"}

For all of these\nevents we derive, where possible, the intrinsic peak energy in the $\\nu\nF_{\\nu}$ spectrum (\\eprest), the duration in the rest-frame, defined as the\ntime in which 90% of the burst fluence was observed (\\tninetyrest) and the\nisotropic equivalent bolometric energy (\\eiso). Results: The distribution of\n\\eprest has mean and median values of 1.1 MeV and 750 keV, respectively. A\nlog-normal fit to the sample of long bursts peaks at ~800 keV. No high-\\ep\npopulation is found but the distribution is biased against low \\ep values. We\nfind the lowest possible \\ep that GBM can recover to be ~ 15 keV. The\n\\tninetyrest distribution of long GRBs peaks at ~10 s. The distribution of\n\\eiso has mean and median values of $8.9\\times 10^{52}$ erg and $8.2 \\times\n10^{52}$ erg, respectively. We confirm the tight correlation between \\eprest\nand \\eiso (Amati relation) and the one between \\eprest and the 1-s peak\nluminosity ($L_p$) (Yonetoku relation). Additionally, we observe a parameter\nreconstruction effect, i.e. the low-energy power law index $\\alpha$ gets softer\nwhen \\ep is located at the lower end of the detector energy range. Moreover, we\ndo not find any significant cosmic evolution of neither \\eprest nor\n\\tninetyrest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 10:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Using a theory for\nnucleic acid secondary structures that accounts for the logarithmic entropy c\nln m for a loop of length m, we study homopolymeric single-stranded nucleic\nacid chains under external force and varying temperature. In the thermodynamic\nlimit of a long strand, the chain displays a phase transition between a low\ntemperature / low force compact (folded) structure and a high temperature /\nhigh force molten (unfolded) structure. The influence of c on phase diagrams,\ncritical exponents, melting, and force extension curves is derived\nanalytically. For vanishing pulling force, only for the limited range of loop\nexponents 2 < c < 2.479 a melting transition is possible; for c <= 2 the chain\nis always in the folded phase and for 2.479 < c always in the unfolded phase. A\nforce induced melting transition with singular behavior is possible for all\nloop exponents c < 2.479 and can be observed experimentally by single molecule\nforce spectroscopy. These findings have implications for the hybridization or\ndenaturation of double stranded nucleic acids. The Poland-Scheraga model for\nnucleic acid duplex melting does not allow base pairing between nucleotides on\nthe same strand in denatured regions of the double strand. If the sequence\nallows these intra-strand base pairs, we show that for a realistic loop\nexponent c ~ 2.1 pronounced secondary structures appear inside the single\nstrands. This leads to a lower melting temperature of the duplex than predicted\nby the Poland-Scheraga model. Further, these secondary structures renormalize\nthe effective loop exponent c^, which characterizes the weight of a denatured\nregion of the double strand, and thus affect universal aspects of the duplex\nmelting transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 21:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-02"}

Systematic \\emph{in situ}\nfour-point conductance measurements were taken on single-crystal STO substrates\ninside vacuum environment.

To check the validity of this claim, we study\nd-wave superconductivity on the checkerboard Hubbard model on a square lattice\nusing the Cellular Dynamical Mean Field theory method with an exact\ndiagonalization solver at zero temperature. The d-wave order parameter is\ncomputed for various inhomogeneity levels over the entire doping range of\ninterest in both strong and weak coupling regimes. At a given doping, the size\nof the d-wave order parameter manifests itself directly in the height of the\ncoherence peaks and hence is an appropriate measure of the strength of\nsuperconductivity. The weak coupling results reveal a suppression of the order\nparameter in the presence of inhomogeneity for small to intermediate hole\ndopings, while it is enhanced for large dopings. In contrast, for strong\ncoupling there is a monotonic decrease in the maximum amplitude of the\nsuperconducting order parameter with inhomogeneity over the entire doping range\nof interest. Furthermore, at moderately high inhomogeneity, the system\nundergoes a first-order transition from the superconducting to the normal state\nin the underdoped regime.

It is natural to expect that the channel\nwith small deletion probabilities has a capacity that varies smoothly with d,\nand that the optimal input distribution is obtained by smoothly perturbing the\ni.i.d.

To develop effective\nsolutions to these questions, we approach these problems in two stages. The\nfirst set of problems assume ideal source-relay channels; this simplification\nhelps illustrate our general methodology and also why our solutions provide\ntight bounds. We then formulate the general problem of transmission strategy\nselection, relay assignment, and power allocation at the sources and relays\nconsidering all communication channels, i.e., finite power source-relay\nchannels.

The\nmotivation comes from the fact that super magnetized neutron stars of $\\sim\n10^{15}$G, magnetars, and magnetized proto-neutron stars born after the\nmagnetically-driven supernovae are likely to have such strong toroidal magnetic\nfields. Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic\nsimulations are performed, preparing isentropic neutron stars with toroidal\nmagnetic fields in equilibrium as initial conditions. To explore the effects of\nrotations on the stability, simulations are done for both non-rotating and\nrigidly rotating models. We find the emergence of the Parker and/or Tayler\ninstabilities in both the non-rotating and rotating models. For both\nnon-rotating and rotating models, the Parker instability is the primary\ninstability as predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. The\ninterchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that\nrapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this\nfinding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. The reason for this is\nthat rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, in\nthe presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed,\nunstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile is\ndeveloped. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited.\nContrary to the axisymmetric case, the magnetic fields never reach an\nequilibrium state after the development of the turbulence. This conclusion\nsuggests that three-dimensional simulation is indispensable for exploring the\nformation of magnetars or prominence activities of magnetars such as giant\nflares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 07:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

Recent calorimetric\nexperiments and computer simulations heavily challenge this established\nparadigm by reporting that water's thermodynamic signature in the binding of\nsmall hydrophobic ligands to similar-sized apolar pockets is enthalpy-driven.\nHere we show with purely geometric considerations that this controversy can be\nresolved if the antagonistic effects of concave and convex bending on water\ninterface thermodynamics are properly taken into account. A key prediction of\nthis continuum view is that for fully complementary binding of the convex\nligand to the concave counterpart, water shows a thermodynamic signature very\nsimilar to planar (large-scale) hydrophobic association, that is,\nenthalpy-dominated, and hardly depends on the particular pocket/ligand\ngeometry. A detailed comparison to recent simulation data qualitatively\nsupports the validity of our perspective down to subnanometer scales.

A volume element\nof the interstellar medium is described as a multiphase system, comprising a\ncold and a warm gas phase in effective (thermal plus turbulent) pressure\nequilibrium, and a stellar component. Since turbulence has a critical impact on\nthe shape of the gaseous phases, on the production of molecular hydrogen and on\nthe formation of stars, the consistent treatment of turbulence energy -- the\nkinetic energy of unresolved motions -- is an important new feature of our\nmodel. Besides turbulence production by supernovae and by the cooling\ninstability, we also take into account the forcing by large scale motions.\n  We formulate a set of ordinary differential equations, which statistically\ndescribes star formation and the exchange between the different budgets of mass\nand energy in a region of the interstellar medium with given mean density,\nsize, metallicity and external turbulence forcing. By exploring the behaviour\nof the solutions, we find equilibrium states, in which the star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with observations. Kennicutt-Schmidt-like relations\nnaturally arise from the equilibrium solutions, while conventional star\nformation models in numerical simulations impose such relations with observed\nefficiency parameters as phenomenological calibrations.\n  Beyond the semi-analytic approach, a potential application is a complete\nsubgrid scale model of the unresolved multi-phase structure, star formation and\nturbulence in simulations of galaxies or in cosmological simulations.

We propose a distributed\nPrediction-based Cognitive Topology Control (PCTC) scheme to provision\ncognition capability to routing in CR-MANETs. PCTC is a midware-like\ncross-layer module residing between CR module and routing. The proposed PCTC\nscheme uses cognitive link availability prediction, which is aware of the\ninterference to primary users, to predict the available duration of links in\nCR-MANETs. Based on the link prediction, PCTC constructs an efficient and\nreliable topology, which is aimed at mitigating re-routing frequency and\nimproving end-to-end network performance such as throughput and delay.\nSimulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed\nscheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 12:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-02"}

Using an updated data set of 109 high\nredshift GRBs, we show that the correlation parameters only weakly depend on\nthe cosmological model. Once the parameters of Amati relation have been\ndetermined we use this relation to construct a fiducial GRBs Hubble diagram\nthat extends up to redshifts ~ 8. Moreover we apply a local regression\ntechnique to estimate, in a model independent way, the distance modulus from\nthe recently updated Union SNIa sample, containing 557 SNIa spanning the\nredshift range of 0.015 < z <1.55. The derived calibration parameters are used\nto construct an updated GRBs Hubble diagram, which we call the calibrated GRBs\nHD. We also compare the fiducial and calibrated GRBs HDs, which turned out to\nbe fully statistically consistent, thus indicating that they are not affected\nby any systematic bias induced by the different calibration procedures. This\nmeans that the high redshift GRBs can be used to test different models of dark\nenergy settling the circularity problem. Furthermore, we investigate possible\nevolutionary effects that might have important influence on our results. Our\nanalysis indicates that the presently available GRBs datasets do not show\nstatistically unambiguous evolutionary effect with the cosmological redshift.\nFinally we propose another approach to calibrate the GRB relations, by using an\napproximate luminosity distance relation, which holds in any cosmological\nmodel. We use this calibration of the Amati relation to construct an empirical\napproximate HD, which we compare with the calibrated GRBs HD.

The formation and early evolution of high- and intermediate-mass\nstars towards the main sequence involves the interplay of stars in a clustered\nand highly complex environment. To obtain a full census of this interaction,\nthe Formation and Early evolution of Massive Stars (FEMS) collaboration studies\na well-selected sample of 10 high-mass star-forming regions. Aims. In this\nstudy we examine the stellar content of the high-mass star-forming region\ncentered on IRAS 06084-0611 in the Monoceros R2 cloud. Methods. Using the\nnear-infrared H- and K-band spectra from the VLT/SINFONI instrument on the ESO\nVery Large Telescope (VLT)and photometric near-infrared NTT/SOFI, 2MASS and\nSpitzer/IRAC data, we were able to determine the spectral types for the most\nluminous stars in the cluster. Results. Two very young and reddened massive\nstars have been detected by SINFONI: a massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) con-\nsistent with an early-B spectral type and a Herbig Be star. Furthermore, stars\nof spectral type G and K are detected while still in the Pre-Main Sequence\n(PMS) phase. We derive additional properties such as temperatures, extinctions,\nradii and masses.

Using Spitzer/IRAC\ndata we confirm earlier studies that the younger class 0/I objects are\ncentrally located while the class II objects are spread out over a larger area,\nwith rough scale size radii of \\sim0.5 pc and \\sim1.25 pc respectively.\nMoreover, the presence of a massive YSO, an ultracompact H ii region and highly\nreddened objects in the center of the cluster suggest a much younger age of < 1\nMyr. A possible scenario for this observation would be sequential star\nformation along the line of sight; from a cluster of intermediate-mass to\nhigh-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 12:58:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

To derive\nthis result I replace the computational strategy of previous work with a new\napproach, wherein the form of the force is first fixed up to a gauge-invariant\npiece by simple manipulations, and then that piece is determined by working in\na gauge designed specifically to simplify the computation.

The\nsample includes 8 newly discovered secure systems. [abridged] We find that the\nSWELLS sample of secure lenses spans a broad range of morphologies (from\nlenticular to late-type spiral), spectral types (quantified by Halpha\nemission), and bulge to total stellar mass ratio (0.22-0.85), while being\nlimited to M_*>10^{10.5} M_sun. The SWELLS sample is thus well-suited for\nexploring the relationship between dark and luminous matter in a broad range of\ngalaxies. We find that the deflector galaxies obey the same size-mass relation\nas that of a comparison sample of elongated non-lens galaxies selected from the\nSDSS survey. We conclude that the SWELLS sample is consistent with being\nrepresentative of the overall population of high-mass high-inclination disky\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 15:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 13:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
