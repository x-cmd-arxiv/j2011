Thus, the structure of Lambda(1405) is closely\nrelated to the Kbar N interaction which is the fundamental ingredient to study\nfew-body systems with antikaon. In this paper, after reviewing the basic\nproperties of the Lambda(1405) resonance, we introduce the dynamical\ncoupled-channel model which respects chiral symmetry of QCD and the unitarity\nof the scattering amplitude.

Proper motions within\nthe jet suggest a decelerating jet flow passing through a slower, accelerating\nwave pattern. We use these observations to develop a mass and energy flux\nconserving model describing the jet flow and conditions along the jet. We\ndetermine the cocoon conditions required if the twisted filaments are the\nresult of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) unstable elliptical mode. We find that the\ncocoon must be cooler than the jet at HST-1 but must be about as hot as the jet\nat knot A. Under these conditions we find that the observed filament wavelength\nis near the elliptical mode maximum growth rate and growth is rapid enough for\nthe filaments to develop and saturate well before HST-1. We generate a\npseudo-synchrotron image of a model jet carrying a combination of normal modes\nof the KH instability. The pseudo-synchrotron image of the jet reveals: (1)\nthat a slow decline in the model jet's surface brightness is still about five\ntimes faster than the real jet; (2) that KH produced dual helically twisted\nfilaments can appear qualitatively similar to those on the real jet if any\nhelical perturbation to the jet is very small or nonexistent inside knot A; (3)\nthat the knots in the real jet cannot be associated with the twisted\nfilamentary features and are unlikely to be the result of a KH instability. The\nexistence of the knots in the real jet, the limb brightening of the real jet in\nthe radio, and the slower decline of the surface brightness of the real jet\nindicate that additional processes --- such as unsteady jet flow and internal\nparticle acceleration --- are occurring within the jet.

A magnetic\ntransition develops at 24 K for Sm1-xYxMnO3 (x=0.4,0.5) which is not present in\nthe parent compound. This transition coincides with the onset of electric\norder, with an electric polarization measured along the c axis. It is proposed\nthat the effect of Y doping is to bring about a subtle distortion of the MnO6\noctahedra, causing a magnetic ordering of the Mn3+ moments similar to that\nreported for the well studied multiferroic TbMnO3. Following on from our\nprevious study on polycrystalline samples, we present measurements of the\nmagnetic and electric properties of single crystal Sm0.6Y0.4MnO3 and\nSm0.5Y0.5MnO3. The data are summarized in a phase diagram for each of the\nprincipal crystallographic axes for the x=0.5 compound. Powder neutron\ndiffraction experiments on SmMnO3 and Sm0.6Y0.4MnO3 show that the Y\nsubstitution causes a change in the Mn-O-Mn bond angle towards the value found\nfor TbMnO3. The magnetic structure of Sm0.6Y0.4MnO3 has been shown to consist\nof two phases: a sinusoidal ordering of the Mn3+ moments below 50 K and a\ncycloidal ordering below 27 K. The cycloidal ordering occurs at the same\ntemperature as the previously observed ferroelectric polarization, suggesting a\nsimilar multiferroic mechanism to that found in TbMnO3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2011 20:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 16:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-17"}

This requires\nus to define a notion of distance between two stochastic processes assuming\nvalues in distinct sets, possibly of different cardinalities.

In this paper, we\nprove that there are only four possible values for the order of a differential\noperator, 0, 1, 2, 3, or $\\infty$. Furthermore, when the order is finite, the\nexpansion $\\Lambda$ is generated by $X$ and a differential polynomial $A$,\nwhich can be obtained through a rational solution of a partial differential\nequation that is given explicitly in this paper. When the order is infinite,\nthe expansion $\\Lambda$ is just the unit ideal. In additional, if, and only if,\nthe order of $\\mathscr{X}$ is 0, 1, or 2, the polynomial differential equation\nassociating with $\\mathscr{X}$ has Liouvillian first integrals. Examples for\neach class of differential operators are given at the end of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2011 01:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 03:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

Cooperation survives because it is possible\nfor close-knit communities of cooperation to be shielded from invasion by\ndefectors. Here we show that parameter ranges in which cooperation can survive\nare strongly expanded if game play on networks is skewed towards more frequent\ninteractions with more successful neighbours. In particular, if agents\nexclusively select neighbors for game play that are more successful than\nthemselves, cooperation can even dominate in situations in which it would die\nout if interaction neighbours were chosen without a bias or with a preference\nfor less successful opponents.

Compared with earlier cases of forced turbulence with\nan isothermal equation of state, we find that the turbulence effect is similar\nto or even stronger in the present case of turbulent convection. This is argued\nto be due to the anisotropy of turbulence in the vertical direction. Another\nimportant difference compared with earlier studies is the presence of an\nevolution equation for the specific entropy. Mean-field modelling with entropy\nevolution indicates that the negative effective magnetic pressure can still\nlead to a large-scale instability which forms local flux concentrations, even\nthough the specific entropy evolution tends to have a stabilizing effect when\napplied to a stably stratified (e.g., isothermal) layer.

If such a\nplanet enters the envelope of an RGB star, it is expected to spiral-in to the\nvery inner region within <100yr, and be evaporated or destructed by the core.\nWe speculate that the planet was engulfed by the star as a result of the core\nhelium flash that caused this metal poor star to swell by a factor of ~3-4.

This question has been much\ndebated since the argument first proposed by Rietdijk and Putnam. The goal of\nthis text is to study the implications of relativity and quantum mechanics on\npresentism, possibilism, and eternalism. We put the emphasis on the implicit\nmetaphysical preconceptions underlying each of these different approaches to\nthe question of time. We show that there exists a unique version of presentism\nwhich is both non-trivial, in the sense that it does not reduce the present to\na unique event, and compatible with special relativity and quantum mechanics:\nthe one in which the present of an observer at a point is identified with the\nbackward light cone of that point. However, this compatibility is achieved at\nthe cost of a renouncement to the notion of an objective, observer-independent\nreality. We also argue that no non-trivial version of presentism survives in\ngeneral relativity, except if some mechanism forbids the existence of closed\ntimelike curves, in which case precisely one version of possibilism does\nsurvive. We remark that the above physical theories force the\npresentist/possibilist's view of reality to shrink and break up, whereas the\neternalist, on the contrary, is forced to grant the status of reality to more\nand more entities.

We interpret our results in the context of proto-planetary disks. We\ninvestigate the turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI)\nusing the PLUTO Godunov code in spherical coordinates with the accurate and\nrobust HLLD Riemann solver. We follow the turbulence for more than 1500 orbits\nat the innermost radius of the domain to measure the overall strength of\nturbulent motions and the detailed accretion flow pattern. We find that regions\nwithin two scale heights of the midplane have a turbulent Mach number of about\n0.1 and a magnetic pressure two to three orders of magnitude less than the gas\npressure, while outside three scale heights the magnetic pressure equals or\nexceeds the gas pressure and the turbulence is transonic, leading to large\ndensity fluctuations. The strongest large-scale density disturbances are spiral\ndensity waves, and the strongest of these waves has m=5. No clear meridional\ncirculation appears in the calculations because fluctuating radial pressure\ngradients lead to changes in the orbital frequency, comparable in importance to\nthe stress gradients that drive the meridional flows in viscous models. The net\nmass flow rate is well-reproduced by a viscous model using the mean stress\ndistribution taken from the MHD calculation. The strength of the mean turbulent\nmagnetic field is inversely proportional to the radius, so the fields are\napproximately force-free on the largest scales. Consequently the accretion\nstress falls off as the inverse square of the radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2011 14:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Our approach is inspired by the\ncontemporary movements in the string theory. The string map of data is defined\nhere by the boundary conditions, characteristic length, real valued and the\nmethod of redistribution of information. As a practical matter, this map\nrepresents the detrending and data standardization procedure. We introduced\nmaps onto 1-end-point and 2-end-point open strings that satisfy the Dirichlet\nand Neumann boundary conditions. The questions of the choice of\nextra-dimensions, symmetries, duality and ways to the partial compactification\nare discussed. Subsequently, we pass to higher dimensional and more complex\nobjects.

The\nmodel of the rotating string which naturally yields calculation of angular\nmomentum is suitable for tracking of several currency pairs. The systematic way\nwhich allows one suggest more structured maps suitable for a simultaneous study\nof several currency pairs was analyzed by means of the G\\^{a}teaux generalized\ndifferential calculus. The effect of the string and brane maps on test data was\nstudied by comparing their mean statistical characteristics. The study revealed\nnotable differences between topologies.
