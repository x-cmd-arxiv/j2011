Cifuolini in 2004 and the NASA-Stanford Gravity Probe-B experiment\nin 2007 confirmed the Lense-Thirring effect as predicted by GR (gravitomagnetic\nfields generated by a rotating massive body, i.e. Earth) within some 10%. In\n2007 gravitomagnetic fields generated by a rotating cryogenic lead disk were\nmeasured by Graham et al. Though these measurements were not conclusive (the\naccuracy of the laser gyrometer was not sufficient to produce a standard\ndeviation small enough) their experiment seems to have seen the same phenomenon\nreported earlier by Tajmar et al., termed parity violation. This means that\ngravitomagnetic fields produced by the cryogenic rotating ring or disk vary\nsubstantially and change sign for clockwise and counter-clockwise directions of\nrotation. The experimental situation therefore occurs to be contradictory. On\nthe one hand GR has been confirmed while at the same time, there seems to be\nexperimental evidence for the existence of extreme gravitomagnetic fields that\ncannot be generated by the movement of large masses. If these experiments can\nbe confirmed, they give a clear indication for the existence of additional\ngravitational fields of non-Newtonian nature. As was shown by the GP-B\nexperiment, measuring gravitomagnetic fields from GR poses extreme\ndifficulties. Therefore a novel physical mechanism should exist for the\ngeneration of gravity-like fields, which might also provide the key to\ngravitational engineering similar to electromagnetic technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2011 17:05:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2011 17:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Thus far, the\napplication of this technique has mostly been restricted to restframe\nultra-violet and optical images. However, with the new radio observatories\nbeing commissioned (MeerKAT, ASKAP, EVLA, WSRT/APERTIF, and ultimately SKA), a\nnew window on the neutral atomic hydrogen gas (HI) morphology of a large\nnumbers of galaxies will open up. The quantified morphology of gas disks of\nspirals can be an alternative indicator of the level and frequency of\ninteraction. The HI in galaxies is typically spatially more extended and more\nsensitive to low-mass or weak interactions. In this paper, we explore six\nmorphological parameters calculated over the extent of the stellar (optical)\ndisk and the extent of the gas disk for a range of wavelengths spanning UV,\nOptical, Near- and Far-Infrared and 21 cm (HI) of 28 galaxies from The HI\nNearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS).

Quantified morphology of stellar spiral disks is one avenue to\ndetermine the merger rate over much of the age of the Universe. In this paper,\nwe measure the quantitative morphology parameters for the HI column density\nmaps from the Westerbork observations of neutral Hydrogen in Irregular and\nSPiral galaxies (WHISP). These are Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness, Gini,\nM20, and one addition of our own, the Gini parameter of the second order moment\n(GM). Our aim is to determine if lopsided or interacting disks can be\nidentified with these parameters. Our sample of 141 HI maps have all previous\nclassifications on their lopsidedness and interaction. We find that the\nAsymmetry, M20, and our new GM parameter correlate only weakly with the\nprevious morphological lopsidedness quantification. These three parameters may\nbe used to compute a probability that an HI disk is morphologically lopsided\nbut not unequivocally to determine it. However, we do find that that the\nquestion whether or not an HI disk is interacting can be settled well using\nmorphological parameters. Parameter cuts from the literature do not translate\nfrom ultraviolet to HI directly but new selection criteria using combinations\nof Asymmetry and M20 or Concentration and M20, work very well.

The consistency of our merger fractions to those published for\nbigger surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, shows that HI morphology\ncan be a very viable way to identify mergers in a large HI survey. The\nrelatively high value for the volume merger rate may be a bias in the selection\nor WHISP volume. The expected boon in high-resolution HI data by the planned\nMeerKAT, ASKAP and WSRT/APERTIF radio observatories will reveal the importance\nof mergers in the local Universe and, with the advent of SKA, over cosmic\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2011 10:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

These morphological disturbances\nare related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxies\nundergo in this dense cluster environment. To quantify the morphological\ntransformation of the HI disks, we compute the morphological parameters of CAS,\nGini, and M20 and our own GM for 51 galaxies in 48 HI column density maps from\nthe VIVA project. Some morphological phenomena can be identified in this space\nof relatively low resolution HI data.

Tidal interaction is typically\nidentified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to\n(optical) images of galaxies. We find that some selection criteria (Gini-M20,\nAsymmetry, and a modified Concentration-M20) are still applicable for the\ncoarse (~15\" FWHM) VIVA HI data. The phenomena of tidal tails can be reasonably\nwell identified using the Gini-M20 criterion (60% of galaxies with tails\nidentified but with as many contaminants).

Therefore, future searches for\ninteraction using HI morphologies should take ram-pressure into account as a\nmechanism to disturb HI disks enough to make them appear as gravitationally\ninteracting. One mechanism would be to remove all the HI deficient (C<5) disks\nfrom the sample, as these have undergone more than one HI removal mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2011 11:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Of three selection criteria used in\nthe literature, one based on Concentration and M20 works well for the HI\nperspective with a merger time scale of 0.4 Gyr. Of the three selection\ncriteria defined in our previous paper, the GM performs well and cleanly\nselects mergers for 0.69 Gyr.

All chemical reaction systems are shaped by the\nsame physics that gives molecules their stability and affinity to react. These\nfundamental factors cannot be captured by standard null-models based on\nrandomization. The unique property of organismal metabolism is that it is\ncontrolled, to some extent, by an enzymatic machinery that is subject to\nevolution. In this paper, we explore the possibility that reaction systems of\nplanetary atmospheres can serve as a null-model against which we can define\nmetabolic structure and trace the influence of evolution. We find that the two\ntypes of data can be distinguished by their respective degree distributions.\nThis is especially clear when looking at the degree distribution of the\nreaction network (of reaction connected to each other if they involve the same\nmolecular species). For the Earth's atmospheric network and the human metabolic\nnetwork, we look into more detail for an underlying explanation of this\ndeviation. However, we cannot pinpoint a single cause of the difference, rather\nthere are several concurrent factors. By examining quantities relating to the\nmodular-functional organization of the metabolism, we confirm that metabolic\nnetworks have a more complex modular organization than the atmospheric\nnetworks, but not much more. We interpret the more variegated modular\narrangement of metabolism as a trace of evolved functionality. On the other\nhand, it is quite remarkable how similar the structures of these two types of\nnetworks are, which emphasizes that the constraints from the chemical\nproperties of the molecules has a larger influence in shaping the reaction\nsystem than does natural selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2011 12:34:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 May 2011 12:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-10"}

Future cosmological\nmeasurements of the matter density, cosmological constant and curvature will\nopen up a window on the very beginning of our Universe and offer an opportunity\nto support or falsify the de Sitter Equilibrium cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2011 13:08:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 21:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Our main results are necessary and sufficient\nconditions for invertibility. We will show that the stationary GARCH($p$, $q$)\nmodel is always invertible, but certain types of models, such as EGARCH of\n\\cite{Nelson1991} and VGARCH of \\cite{EngleNg1993} may indeed be\nnon-invertible. Moreover, we will demonstrate it's possible for the pair (true\nvolatility, approximation) to have a non-degenerate stationary distribution.
