The radiation causes a decrease of the average\nswitching current of the wire. This suppression of the switching current is\nmodeled assuming that there is one-to-one correspondence between Little's phase\nslips and the experimentally observed switching events. At some critical power\nP* of the radiation a dissipative dynamic superconducting state occurs as an\nextra step on the V-I curve. It is identified as a phase slip center (PSC).\nWith the dependence of the switching currents and the standard deviations\nobserved at the transitions (i) from a constant supercurrent state to a normal\nstate and (ii) from a constant superconducting state to a PSC state, we\nconclude that both of the two types of the switching events are triggered by\nthe same microscopic event, namely a single Little's phase slip. We show that\nthe Skocpol-Beasely-Tinkham model is not applicable to our microwave-driven\nphase slip centers, since it leads to an unphysical small estimated value of\nthe size of the dissipative core of the PSC. Through the analysis of the\nwitching current distributions at a sufficiently low temperature, we also\npresent evidence that the quantum phase slip play a role in switching events\nunder microwaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 16:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-26"}

These problems are notorious\nfor the existence of huge gaps between the known algorithmic results and\nNP-hardness results. Our algorithm is based on rounding semidefinite programs\nfrom the Lasserre hierarchy, and the analysis uses bounds for low-rank\napproximations of a matrix in Frobenius norm using columns of the matrix.\n  For all the above graph problems, we give an algorithm running in time\n$n^{O(r/\\epsilon^2)}$ with approximation ratio\n$\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\min\\{1,\\lambda_r\\}}$, where $\\lambda_r$ is the $r$'th\nsmallest eigenvalue of the normalized graph Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}$. In the\ncase of graph bisection and small set expansion, the number of vertices in the\ncut is within lower-order terms of the stipulated bound.

To define sepcanonical system, we must endow the curve with extra\nstructure called an 'azimuthal structure'.

Thermal phase curves (variations of the apparent infrared\nemission of the planet with its orbital phase) have been observed for hot\nJupiters in both transiting and nontransiting configurations, and could be\nobserved for hot terrestrial exoplanets. We study the wavelength and phase\nchanges of the thermal emission of a tidally-locked terrestrial planet as\natmospheric pressure increases, and address the observability of these\nmultiband phase-curves and the ability to use them to detect atmospheric\nconstituents. We used a 3D climate model (GCM) to simulate the CO2 atmosphere\nof a terrestrial planet on an 8-day orbit around a M3 dwarf and its apparent\ninfrared emission as a function of its orbital phase.

We report the first study of the peculiar ring-like galaxy HRG 2304\n(NED02),which was previously classified as a ring galaxy with an elliptical\nsmooth ring. This object was selected to prove that it is a candidate for the\nSolitaire-type ring galaxies in an early stage of ring formation. The main goal\nof this work is to provide the spectral characteristics of the current object\nand its companion AM 1646-795 (NED01). Methods. The study is based on\nspectroscopic observations in the optical band to highlight the characteristics\nof this interacting galaxy. To investigate the star formation history of HRG\n2304 we used the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT. The direct V and\nB broad band images were used to enhance some fine structures. Results. Along\nthe entire long-slit signal, the spectra of HRG 2304 and its companion resemble\nthat of an early-type galaxy. We estimated a heliocentric systemic redshift of\nz = 0.0415, corresponding to heliocentric velocities of 12449 km s-1 for HRG\n2304 (NED02) and 12430 km s-1 for AM1646-795 (NED01).

Conclusions.The spectroscopic\nresults and the morphological peculiarities of HRG 2304 can be adequately\ninterpreted as an ongoing interaction with the companion galaxy. Both galaxies\nare early-type, the companion is elliptical, and the smooth distribution of the\nmaterial around HRG 2304 and its off-center nucleus in the direction of\nAM1646-795 (NED01) characterize HRG 2304 as a Solitaire-type galaxy candidate\nin an early stage of ring formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 18:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

It is based on kinematics of particles moving near the horizon. This\neffect arises when particles of two kinds collide near the horizon. For massive\nparticles, the first kind represents a particle with the generic energy and\nangular momentum (I call them \"usual\"). Near the horizon, such a particle has a\nvelocity almost equal to that of light in the frame that corotates with a black\nhole (the frame is static if a black hole is static). The second kind (called\n\"critical\") consists of particles with the velocity v<c near the horizon due to\nspecial relationship between the energy and angular momentum (or charge). As a\nresult, the relative velocity approaches the speed of light c, the Lorentz\nfactor grows unbound. This explanation applies both to generic rotating black\nholes and charged ones (even for radial motion of particles). If one of\ncolliding particles is massless (photon), the critical particle is\ndistinguished by the fact that its frequency is finite near the horizon. The\nexistence (or absence) of the effect is determined depending on competition of\ntwo factors - gravitational blue shift for a photon propagating towards a black\nhole and the Doppler effect due to transformation from the locally nonrotating\nframe to a comoving one. Classification of all possible types of collisions is\nsuggested depending on whether massive or massless particle is critical or\nusual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 20:33:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 19:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-12"}

By systematic\nsimplification of the arising Morse-Smale complex in a one-parameter process we\nshow that equilibria occur typically in highly localized groups (flocks), the\nnumber of the latter can be reliably observed and determined by hand\nexperiments. Both local and global (micro and macro) equilibria can be either\nstable or unstable. Most commonly, rocks and pebbles are balanced on stable\nlocal equilibria belonging to stable flocks. However, it is possible to balance\na convex body on a stable local equilibrium belonging to an unstable flock and\nthis is the intriguing mechanical scenario corresponding to rocking stones.\nSince outside observers can only reliably perceive flocks, the last described\nsituation will appear counter-intuitive. Comparison of computer experiments to\nhand experiments reveals that the latter are consistent, i.e. the flocks can be\nreliably counted and the pebble classification system proposed in our previous\nwork (Domokos et al 2010) is robustly applicable. We also find an interesting\nlogarithmic relationship between the Zingg parameters and the average number of\nglobal equilibrium points, indicating a close relationship between the two\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 21:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-27"}

This\nframework, expressed through a set of differential equations, synthesizes the\nimpact of ionic currents on a cell's voltage -- and the highly nonlinear impact\nof that voltage back on the currents themselves -- into the rapid push and pull\nof the action potential. Latter studies confirmed that these cellular dynamics\nare orchestrated by individual ion channels, whose conformational changes\nregulate the conductance of each ionic current. Thus, kinetic equations\nfamiliar from physical chemistry are the natural setting for describing\nconductances; for small-to-moderate numbers of channels, these will predict\nfluctuations in conductances and stochasticity in the resulting action\npotentials. At first glance, the kinetic equations provide a far more complex\n(and higher-dimensional) description than the original Hodgkin-Huxley\nequations. This has prompted more than a decade of efforts to capture channel\nfluctuations with noise terms added to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. Many of\nthese approaches, while intuitively appealing, produce quantitative errors when\ncompared to kinetic equations; others, as only very recently demonstrated, are\nboth accurate and relatively simple. We review what works, what doesn't, and\nwhy, seeking to build a bridge to well-established results for the\ndeterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations.

This paper examines the use of CS in the design\nof a wideband radio receiver in a noisy environment. We formulate the problem\nstatement for such a receiver and establish a reasonable set of requirements\nthat a receiver should meet to be practically useful. We then evaluate the\nperformance of a CS-based receiver in two ways: via a theoretical analysis of\nits expected performance, with a particular emphasis on noise and dynamic\nrange, and via simulations that compare the CS receiver against the performance\nexpected from a conventional implementation. On the one hand, we show that\nCS-based systems that aim to reduce the number of acquired measurements are\nsomewhat sensitive to signal noise, exhibiting a 3dB SNR loss per octave of\nsubsampling, which parallels the classic noise-folding phenomenon. On the other\nhand, we demonstrate that since they sample at a lower rate, CS-based systems\ncan potentially attain a significantly larger dynamic range. Hence, we conclude\nthat while a CS-based system has inherent limitations that do impose some\nrestrictions on its potential applications, it also has attributes that make it\nhighly desirable in a number of important practical settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 05:05:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 14:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 05:31:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 01:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

However, if gas infall is important,\nradial gas flows should be taken into account as a dynamical consequence of\ninfall. The aim of this paper is to test the effect of radial gas flows on\ndetailed chemical evolution models (one-infall and two-infall) for the Milky\nWay disk with different prescriptions for the infall law and star formation\nrate. We found, that with a gas radial inflow of constant speed the metallicity\ngradient tends to steepen. Taking into account a constant time scale for the\ninfall rate along the Galaxy disk and radial flows with a constant speed, we\nobtained a too flat gradient, at variance with data, implying that an\ninside-out formation and/or a variable gas flow speed are required. To\nreproduce the observed gradients the gas flow should increase in modulus with\nthe galactocentric distance, both in the one-infall and two-infall models.\nHowever, the inside-out disk formation coupled with a threshold in the gas\ndensity (only in the two-infall model) for star formation and/or a variable\nefficiency of star formation with galactocentric distance can also reproduce\nthe observed gradients without radial flows. We showed that the radial flows\ncan be the most important process in reproducing abundance gradients but only\nwith a variable gas speed. Finally, one should consider that uncertainties in\nthe data concerning gradients prevent us to draw firm conclusions. Future more\ndetailed data will help to ascertain whether the radial flows are a necessary\ningredient in the formation and evolution of the Galactic disk and disks in\ngeneral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We\nlooked for any correlations between the X-ray properties and the intrinsic\nparameters of our sample of LINER 1s. An absorbed power-law gave a good fit to\nthe spectra of 9 out of the 13 sources. A thermal component and an absorbed\npower-law were required in the remaining 4 sources.

Our arguments involve a blend of Bayesian and frequentist reasoning,\nand are intended to complement the original case made by Gelman (2006) in\nsupport of the folded-t family of priors. First, we generalize the half-Cauchy\nprior to the wider class of hypergeometric inverted-beta priors. We derive\nexpressions for posterior moments and marginal densities when these priors are\nused for a top-level normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. We go on\nto prove a proposition that, together with the results for moments and\nmarginals, allows us to characterize the frequentist risk of the Bayes\nestimators under all global-shrinkage priors in the class. These theoretical\nresults, in turn, allow us to study the frequentist properties of the\nhalf-Cauchy prior versus a wide class of alternatives. The half-Cauchy occupies\na sensible 'middle ground' within this class: it performs very well near the\norigin, but does not lead to drastic compromises in other parts of the\nparameter space. This provides an alternative, classical justification for the\nrepeated, routine use of this prior. We also consider situations where the\nunderlying mean vector is sparse, where we argue that the usual conjugate\nchoice of an inverse-gamma prior is particularly inappropriate, and can lead to\nhighly distorted posterior inferences. Finally, we briefly summarize some open\nissues in the specification of default priors for scale terms in hierarchical\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 14:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2011 02:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-27"}

The superconductivity in high temperature cuprate\nsuperconductors arises from suppressing an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott\ninsulator phase by doping1 while that in iron-pnictide high temperature\nsuperconductors arises from AFM semimetals and can coexist with AFM orders2-9.\nThis key difference marked in their phase diagrams has raised many intriguing\ndebates about whether the two materials can be placed in the same category to\nunderstand the mechanism of superconductivity.

One set of optimized data is validated in\nthe experimental result.The experimental results and the theoretic analysis\nindicate that an all-fiber optical interleaver with -3dB passband width in odd\nchannels and even channels could be obtained, which having more than 60GHz\npassband and 30GHz passband, for transmission speed of 40Gb/s and 10Gb/s,\nrespectively.By assigning different portions of spectrum to the 10Gb/s and the\n40 Gb/s channels, the bandwidth efficiency requirement of the 40 Gb/s channel\nis relieved, and therefore longer transmission distance can be\nachieved.Comparing with the conventional asymmetric interleaver, the most\nobvious benefit of the proposed interleaver is all-fiber structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 15:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-27"}

That is, for each smooth function f : R^n\n--> R there is an n-fold operation \\Phi_f : C^\\infty(X)^n --> C^\\infty(X)\nacting by \\Phi_f: (c_1,...,c_n) |--> f(c_1,...,c_n), and these operations\n\\Phi_f satisfy many natural identities. Thus, C^\\infty(X) actually has a far\nricher structure than the obvious R-algebra structure.\n  We explain a version of algebraic geometry in which rings or algebras are\nreplaced by C-infinity rings. As schemes are the basic objects in algebraic\ngeometry, the new basic objects are \"C-infinity schemes\", a category of\ngeometric objects generalizing manifolds, and whose morphisms generalize smooth\nmaps. We also discuss \"C-infinity stacks\", including Deligne-Mumford C-infinity\nstacks, a 2-category of geometric objects generalizing orbifolds. We study\nquasicoherent and coherent sheaves on C-infinity schemes and C-infinity stacks,\nand orbifold strata of Deligne-Mumford C-infinity stacks. This enables us to\nuse the tools of algebraic geometry in differential geometry, and to describe\nsingular spaces such as moduli spaces occurring in differential geometric\nproblems.\n  Many of these ideas are not new: C-infinity rings and C-infinity schemes have\nlong been part of synthetic differential geometry. But we develop them in new\ndirections. In a new book, surveyed in arXiv:1206.4207 and at greater length in\narXiv:1208.4948, the author uses C-infinity algebraic geometry to develop a\ntheory of \"derived differential geometry\", which studies \"d-manifolds\" and\n\"d-orbifolds\", derived versions of smooth manifolds and orbifolds.
