We use empirically determined stellar evolution models to predict\nthe past evolution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II) Luminous Red\nGalaxy (LRG) sample without any a-priori assumption about galaxy evolution. By\ncarefully contrasting the evolution of the predicted and observed number and\nluminosity densities we test the passive evolution scenario for galaxies of\ndifferent luminosity, and determine minimum merger rates. We find that the LRG\npopulation is not purely coeval, with some of galaxies targeted at z<0.23 and\nat z>0.34 showing different dynamical growth than galaxies targeted throughout\nthe sample. Our results show that the LRG population is dynamically growing,\nand that this growth must be dominated by the faint end. For the most luminous\ngalaxies, we find lower minimum merger rates than required by previous studies\nthat assume passive stellar evolution, suggesting that some of the dynamical\nevolution measured previously was actually due to galaxies with non-passive\nstellar evolution being incorrectly modelled. Our methodology can be used to\nidentify and match coeval populations of galaxies across cosmic times, over one\nor more surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 16:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 15:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

As\nmight yet be naively expected, duality violations are in some sense \"maximal\"\nfor zero-width bound states and they become weaker for broader resonances whose\npoles lie further away from the physical axis. Furthermore, to a certain\nextent, they can be suppressed by choosing appropriate weight functions in the\nfinite-energy sum rules. A simplified Ansatz for including effects of duality\nviolations in phenomenological QCD sum rule analyses is discussed as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 17:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 16:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We furthermore discuss the brick polytopes of sorting networks\nsupporting pseudoline arrangements which correspond to multitriangulations of\nconvex polygons: our polytopes only realize subgraphs of the flip graphs on\nmultitriangulations and they cannot appear as projections of a hypothetical\nmultiassociahedron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 18:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 14:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-29"}

A first hypothesis that the modes in the bump\narise from a large degeneracy that restores agreement between the spectral\nstaircase and the Weyl asymptotic formula immediately above the spectral gap\ngives a number of modes that is too large by a factor of around 60000. An\nalternative hypothesis that the modes in the bump arise from harmonic forms on\nthe compact 7-manifold that are classically massless and acquire approximately\nequal masses from the leading quantum corrections to the CJS action naturally\nexplains the slight reduction on a logarithmic scale in the number of modes\nrelative to the first hypothesis, and predicts that the bump is spin 0 if the\ncompact hyperbolic factor of large intrinsic volume is 7-dimensional, and a\nmixture of spins 0 and 1 if it is 5-dimensional or 3-dimensional.

This paper describes a detailed charge\ncalibration study of the pixel devices, which allows the true charge to be\nextracted, and reports on measurements of the charge collection characteristics\nand Landau distributions. The planar sensor achieved a best resolution of 4.0\nmicron for angled tracks, and resolutions of between 4.4 and 11 micron for\nperpendicular tracks, depending on the applied bias voltage. The double sided\n3D sensor, which has significantly less charge sharing, was found to have an\noptimal resolution of 9.0 micron for angled tracks, and a resolution of 16.0\nmicron for perpendicular tracks.

For the\ninterface solutions at hand this reduces to a Laplace-Beltrami equation on a\nRiemann surface with disk topology, and in the simplest case of the\nsupersymmetric Janus solution it further reduces to an ordinary differential\nequation known as Heun's equation. We solve this equation numerically, and\nexhibit the spectrum as a function of the dilaton-jump parameter $\\Delta\\phi$.\nIn the limit of large $\\Delta\\phi$ a nearly-flat linear-dilaton dimension grows\nlarge, and the Janus geometry becomes effectively five-dimensional. We also\ndiscuss the difficulties of localizing four-dimensional gravity in the more\ngeneral backgrounds with NS5-brane or D5-brane charge, which will be analyzed\nin detail in a companion paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 22:30:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 09:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-07"}

In both instances, the\nextrapolation to the physical pion mass allows for a bound H-dibaryon or a\nnear-threshold scattering state. Further lattice QCD calculations are required\nto clarify this situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 00:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 23:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Interposed boundaries or insulators\nare able to block these long distance regulatory interactions. The mechanistic\nbasis for insulator activity and how it relates to enhancer\naction-at-a-distance remains unclear. Here we explore the idea that topological\nloops could simultaneously account for regulatory interactions of distal\nenhancers and the insulating activity of boundary elements. We show that while\nloop formation is not in itself sufficient to explain action at a distance,\nincorporating transient non-specific and moderate attractive interactions\nbetween the chromatin fibers strongly enhances long-distance regulatory\ninteractions and is sufficient to generate a euchromatin-like state. Under\nthese same conditions, the subdivision of the loop into two topologically\nindependent loops by insulators inhibits inter-domain interactions. The\nunderlying cause of this effect is a suppression of crossings in the contact\nmap at intermediate distances. Thus our model simultaneously accounts for\nregulatory interactions at a distance and the insulator activity of boundary\nelements. This unified model of the regulatory roles of chromatin loops makes\nseveral testable predictions that could be confronted with \\emph{in vitro}\nexperiments, as well as genomic chromatin conformation capture and fluorescent\nmicroscopic approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 03:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Otherwise, it would have smoothed out the abundance\nprofiles, and this would have been observed. The sulfur chemistry depends\nstrongly on the 1D physical conditions. In our case, no conclusion can be given\non the relative age of IRAS 18264, IRAS 18162 and IRAS 05358 except that they\nare very close. W43-MM1 seems younger than the other sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 09:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

MIR photometry plus optical/near-IR observations are also reported.\nAn early-time MIR excess is attributed to emission from non-silicate dust\nformed within a cool dense shell (CDS). Most of the CDS dust condensed between\n50 d and 165 d, reaching a mass of 0.3 x 10^{-5} Msun. Throughout the\nobservations much of the longer wavelength (>10 microns) part of the continuum\nis explained as an IR echo from interstellar dust. The MIR excess strengthened\nat later times. We show that this was due to thermal emission from warm,\nnon-silicate dust formed in the ejecta. Using optical/near-IR line-profiles and\nthe MIR continua, we show that the dust was distributed as a disk whose radius\nappeared to be slowly shrinking. The disk radius may correspond to a grain\ndestruction zone caused by a reverse shock which also heated the dust. The\ndust-disk lay nearly face-on, had high opacities in the optical/near-IR\nregions, but remained optically thin in the MIR over much of the period\nstudied.

Nevertheless, this study suggests\nthat the amount of freshly-synthesized dust in the SN 2004dj ejecta is\nconsistent with that found from previous studies, and adds further weight to\nthe claim that such events could not have been major contributors to the cosmic\ndust budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 11:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 16:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

A previous X-ray study of this SNR found a hard X-ray\nsource near its centre. Using all available archival and proprietary XMM-Newton\ndata, alongside new multi-frequency radio-continuum surveys and optical\nobservations at H-alpha and forbidden [SII] and [OIII] lines, we aim to\nconstrain the properties of the SNR and discover the nature of the hard source\nwithin. Methods: We combine XMM-Newton datasets to produce the highest quality\nX-ray image of IKT 16 to date. We use this, in combination with radio and\noptical images, to conduct a multi-wavelength morphological analysis of the\nremnant. We extract separate spectra from the SNR and the bright source near\nits centre, and conduct spectral fitting of both regions. Results: We find IKT\n16 to have a radius of 37+-3 pc, with the bright source located 8+-2 pc from\nthe centre. This is the largest known SNR in the SMC. The large size of the\nremnant suggests it is likely in the Sedov-adiabatic phase of evolution. Using\na Sedov model to fit the SNR spectrum, we find an electron temperature kT of\n1.03+-0.12 keV and an age of 14700 yr. The absorption found requires the\nremnant to be located deep within the SMC. The bright source is fit with a\npower law with index 1.58+-0.07, and is associated with diffuse radio emission\nextending towards the centre of the SNR. We argue that this source is likely to\nbe the neutron star remnant of the supernova explosion, and infer its\ntransverse kick velocity to be 580+-100 km/s. The X-ray and radio properties of\nthis source strongly favour a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 14:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Luttinger liquid theory supports\na mode-locking mechanism in which mass (or velocity) asymmetry is identified as\nthe key ingredient to stabilize such states. While the scenario is valid both\nin the continuum and on a lattice, the effects of umklapp terms relevant for\ndensities commensurate with the lattice spacing are also mentioned. These ideas\nare illustrated and confronted with the physics of the asymmetric\n(mass-imbalanced) fermionic Hubbard model with attractive interactions and\ndensities such that a trimer phase can be stabilized. Phase diagrams are\ncomputed using density-matrix renormalization group techniques, showing the\nimportant role of the total density in achieving the novel phase. The effective\nphysics of the trimer gas is as well studied. Lastly, the effect of a parabolic\nconfinement and the emergence of a crystal phase of trimers are briefly\naddressed. This model has connections with the physics of imbalanced\ntwo-component fermionic gases and Bose-Fermi mixtures as the latter gives a\ngood phenomenological description of the numerics in the strong-coupling\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 15:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-19"}
