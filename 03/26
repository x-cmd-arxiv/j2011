While the pulsations lead to large-amplitude\nphotometric variability, the dusty envelopes cause pronounced circumstellar\nreddening. Based on one selected dynamical model which is representative of\nC-type Mira variables with intermediate mass loss rates, we calculated\nsynthetic spectra and photometry for standard broad-band filters from the\nvisual to the near-infrared. Our modelling allows to investigate in detail the\nsubstantial effect of circumstellar dust on the resultant photometry. The\npronounced absorption of amorphous carbon dust grains leads to colour indices\nwhich are significantly redder than the corresponding ones based on hydrostatic\ndust-free models. Only if we account for this circumstellar reddening we get\nsynthetic colours that are comparable to observations of evolved AGB stars. The\nphotometric variations of the dynamical model were compared to observed\nlightcurves of the C-type Mira RU_Vir which appears to be quite similar to the\nmodel. We found good agreement concerning the principal behaviour of the\nBVRIJHKL lightcurves and also quantitatively fitting details. The analysed\nmodel is able to reproduce the variations of RU_Vir and other Miras in (J-H)\nvs. (H-K) diagrams throughout the light cycle. Contrasting the model photometry\nwith observational data for a variety of galactic C-rich giants in such\ncolour-colour diagrams proved that the chosen atmospheric model fits well into\na sequence of objects with increasing mass loss rates, i.e., redder colour\nindices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 16:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We recently proposed\nto use a new method of monochromatization exploiting a single crystal in\nBragg-transmission geometry for self-seeding in the hard X-ray range. Here we\nconsider a possible extension of this method to the soft X-ray range using a\ncell filled with resonantly absorbing gas as monochromator. The transmittance\nspectrum in the gas exhibits an absorbing resonance with narrow bandwidth.\nThen, similarly to the hard X-ray case, the temporal waveform of the\ntransmitted radiation pulse is characterized by a long monochromatic wake. In\nfact, the FEL pulse forces the gas atoms to oscillate in a way consistent with\na forward-propagating, monochromatic radiation beam. The radiation power within\nthis wake is much larger than the equivalent shot noise power in the electron\nbunch. Further on, the monochromatic wake of the radiation pulse is combined\nwith the delayed electron bunch and amplified in the second undulator. The\nproposed setup is extremely simple, and composed of as few as two simple\nelements. These are the gas cell, to be filled with noble gas, and a short\nmagnetic chicane. The installation of the magnetic chicane does not perturb the\nundulator focusing system and does not interfere with the baseline mode of\noperation.

Chevalley,\nallows to compute this decomposition: this algorithm is an adaptation to this\ncontext of the Newton method, which gives here the exact value of the\nabsolutely semi-simple part $d$ of $u$ after a finite number of iterations. We\nillustrate the effectiveness of this method by computing the decomposition of a\n$15 \\times 15$ matrix having eigenvalues of multiplicity 3 which are not\ncomputable exactly. We also discuss the other classical method, based on the\nchinese remainder theorem, which gives the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition under\nthe form $u=q(u) +[u-q(u)],$ with $q(u)$ absolutely semi-simple, $u-q(u)$\nnilpotent, where $q$ is any solution of a system of congruence equations\nrelated to the roots of a polynomial $p\\in k[x]$ such that $p(u)=0.$ It is\nindeed possible to compute $q$ without knowing the roots of $p$ by applying the\nalgorithm discussed above to $\\pi(x),$ where $\\pi: k[x] \\to k[x]/pk[x]$ is the\ncanonical surjection.

However, linear calculations show\nthat the combined effect of self-gravity through the background and through the\nlinear response shifts the most unstable vortex mode to higher $m.$ Nonlinear\nhydrodynamic simulations of planetary gaps show more vortices develop with\nincreasing strength of self-gravity. For sufficiently large disc mass the\nvortex instability is suppressed and replaced by a new global instability,\nconsistent with analytical expectations. In the nonlinear regime, vortex\nmerging is increasingly delayed as the disc mass increases and multiple\nvortices may persist until the end of simulations. With self-gravity, the\npost-merger vortex is localised in azimuth and has similar structure to a\nKida-like vortex. This is unlike the case without self-gravity where vortices\nmerge to form a single vortex extended in azimuth. We also performed a series\nof supplementary simulations of co-orbital Kida-like vortices and found that\nself-gravity enables such vortices to execute horseshoe turns upon encountering\neach other. As a result vortex merging is avoided on time-scales where it would\noccur without self-gravity. Thus we suggest that mutual repulsion of\nself-gravitating vortices in a rotating flow is responsible for the delayed\nvortex merging above. The effect of self-gravity on vortex-induced migration is\nbriefly discussed. We found that when self-gravity is included, the\nvortex-induced type III migration of Lin & Papaloizou (2010) is delayed but the\nextent of migration is unchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 16:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We find a linear instability associated with both the\nself-gravity of the disc and local vortensity maxima which coincide with gap\nedges. For our models, these edge modes develop and extend to twice the orbital\nradius of a Saturn mass planet in discs with disc-to-star mass ratio >0.06,\ncorresponding to a Toomre Q < 1.5 at the outer disc boundary. Unlike the local\nvortex-forming instabilities associated with gap edges in weakly or\nnon-self-gravitating low viscosity discs, the edge modes are global and exist\nonly in sufficiently massive discs, but for the typical viscosity values\nadopted for protoplanetary discs. Analytic modelling and linear calculations\nshow edge modes may be interpreted as a localised disturbance associated with a\ngap edge inducing activity in the extended disc, through the launching of\ndensity waves excited at Lindblad resonances. Nonlinear hydrodynamic\nsimulations are performed to investigate the evolution of edge modes in\ndisc-planet systems. The form and growth rates of unstable modes are consistent\nwith linear theory. Their dependence on viscosity and gravitational softening\nis also explored. We also performed a first study of the effect of edge modes\non planetary migration. We found that if edge modes develop, then the average\ndisc-on-planet torque becomes more positive with increasing disc mass. In\nsimulations where the planet was allowed to migrate, although a fast type III\nmigration could be seen that was similar to that seen in non-self-gravitating\ndiscs, we found that it was possible for the planet to interact gravitationally\nwith the spiral arms associated with an edge mode and that this could result in\nthe planet being scattered outwards.

We focus on how the method can be used in the\ncharacterisation of transiting systems having a low-mass stellar companion with\nno need to be monitored with radial-velocity measurements or ground-based\nphotometric observations. The model, which provides a good estimate of the\nsystem parameters, is also useful as a complementary approach to select\npossible planetary candidates. A list of confirmed binaries together with our\nestimate of their parameters are presented. The characterisation of the first\ntwelve detected CoRoT exoplanetary systems was also performed and agrees very\nwell with the results of their respective announcement papers. The comparison\nwith confirmed systems validates our method, specially when the radius of the\nsecondary companion is smaller than 1.5 Rjup, in the case of planets, or larger\nthan 2 Rjup, in the case of low-mass stars. Intermediate situations are not\nconclusive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 17:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2011 07:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-01"}

This raises the\nquestion of how heat is generated and how energy is transported in MHD\nturbulence. By analysis of a number of radiation/MHD stratified shearing-box\nsimulations, we show that the divergence of the diffusive radiation flux is\nindeed capped at the critical rate, but deep inside the disk, substantial\nvertical energy flux is also carried by advection of radiation. Work done by\nradiation pressure is a significant part of the energy budget, and much of this\nwork is dissipated later through damping by radiative diffusion. We show how\nthis damping can be measured in the simulations, and identify its physical\norigins. Radiative damping accounts for as much as tens of percent of the total\ndissipation, and is the only realistic physical mechanism for dissipation of\nturbulence that can actually be resolved in numerical simulations of accretion\ndisks. Buoyancy associated with dynamo-driven, highly magnetized,\nnearly-isobaric nonlinear slow magnetosonic fluctuations is responsible for the\nradiation advection flux, and also explains the persistent periodic magnetic\nupwelling seen at all values of the radiation to gas pressure ratio. The\nintimate connection between radiation advection and magnetic buoyancy is the\nfirst example we know of in astrophysics in which a dynamo has direct impact on\nthe global energetics of a system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 18:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In two competing scenarios,\nthey either originate from local atomic spins, or are a property of cooperative\nspin-density-wave (SDW) behavior of conduction electrons. Both assume clear\npartition into localized electrons, giving rise to local spins, and itinerant\nones, occupying well-defined, rigid conduction bands. Here, by performing an\nINS study of spin dynamics in iron telluride, a parent material of one of the\niron-based HTSC families, we have discovered that this very assumption fails,\nand that conduction and localized electrons are fundamentally entangled. We\nfind that the real-space structure of magnetic correlations can be explained by\na simple local-spin plaquette model. However, the effective spin implicated in\nsuch a model, appears to increase with the increasing temperature. Thus, we\nobserve a remarkable redistribution of magnetism between the two groups of\nelectrons, which occurs in the temperature range relevant for the\nsuperconductivity.

The latter is used to give\nexplicit sufficient conditions for the appearance and bounds for the size of\nthe spectral gap of $L$. These techniques are applied to Glauber dynamics\nassociated to Gibbs measure and conditions are derived extending all previous\nknown results. In the high temperature regime now potentials also with a\nnon-trivial negative part can be treated. Furthermore, a special class of\npotentials is defined for which the size of the spectral gap is as least as\nlarge as for the free system and, surprisingly, is independent of the activity.\nThis type of potentials should not show any phase transition for a given\ntemperature at any activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 20:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-29"}
