We apply the theory of Lie group\ndeformations to isometry groups of exact solutions in general relativity,\nrelating the algebraic properties of these groups to physical properties of the\nspacetimes. We then make group deformation local, generalising deformed special\nrelativity (DSR) by describing gravity as a gauge theory of the de Sitter\ngroup. We find that in our construction Minkowski space has a connection with\ntorsion; physical effects of torsion seem to rule out the proposed framework as\na viable theory. A third chapter discusses a formulation of gravity as a\ntopological BF theory with added linear constraints that reduce the symmetries\nof the topological theory to those of general relativity. We discretise our\nconstructions and compare to a similar construction by Plebanski which uses\nquadratic constraints. In the second part we study CP violation in the\nelectroweak sector of the standard model and certain extensions of it. We\nquantify fine-tuning in the observed magnitude of CP violation by determining a\nnatural measure on the space of CKM matrices, a double quotient of SU(3),\nintroducing different possible choices and comparing their predictions for CP\nviolation. While one generically faces a fine-tuning problem, in the standard\nmodel the problem is removed by a measure that incorporates the observed quark\nmasses, which suggests a close relation between a mass hierarchy and\nsuppression of CP violation. Going beyond the standard model by adding a\nleft-right symmetry spoils the result, leaving us to conclude that such\nadditional symmetries appear less natural.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 16:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-04"}

This amounts to consider higher\norder theories, and the natural case to start with is to analyze generic\nsquare-curvature corrections to Einstein-Hilbert action. In this case, the\nSchrodinger invariant sector in the space of solutions arises for a special\nrelation between the coupling constants appearing in the action. On the other\nhand, besides the Schrodinger invariant configurations, logarithmic branches\nsimilar to those of the so-called Log-gravity are also shown to emerge for\nanother special choice of the coupling constants. These Log solutions can be\ninterpreted as the superposition of the massless mode of General Relativity and\ntwo scalar modes that saturate the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound (BF) of the AdS\nspace on which they propagate. These solutions are higher-dimensional analogues\nof those appearing in three-dimensional massive gravities with relaxed AdS_3\nasymptotic. Other sectors of the space of solutions of higher-curvature\ntheories correspond to oscillatory configurations, which happen to be below the\nBF bound. Also, there is a fully degenerated sector, for which any wave profile\nis admitted. We comment on the relation between this degeneracy and the\nnon-renormalization of the dynamical exponent of the Schrodinger spaces. Our\nanalysis also includes more general gravitational actions with non-polynomial\ncorrections consisting of arbitrary functions of the square-curvature\ninvariants.

The hypervisor schedules execution of these VMs much as the scheduler\nin an operating system does, balancing factors such as fairness and I/O\nperformance. As in an operating system, the scheduler may be vulnerable to\nmalicious behavior on the part of users seeking to deny service to others or\nmaximize their own resource usage.\n  Recently, publically available cloud computing services such as Amazon EC2\nhave used virtualization to provide customers with virtual machines running on\nthe provider's hardware, typically charging by wall clock time rather than\nresources consumed. Under this business model, manipulation of the scheduler\nmay allow theft of service at the expense of other customers, rather than\nmerely reallocating resources within the same administrative domain.\n  We describe a flaw in the Xen scheduler allowing virtual machines to consume\nalmost all CPU time, in preference to other users, and demonstrate kernel-based\nand user-space versions of the attack. We show results demonstrating the\nvulnerability in the lab, consuming as much as 98% of CPU time regardless of\nfair share, as well as on Amazon EC2, where Xen modifications protect other\nusers but still allow theft of service. In case of EC2, following the\nresponsible disclosure model, we have reported this vulnerability to Amazon;\nthey have since implemented a fix that we have tested and verified (See\nAppendix B). We provide a novel analysis of the necessary conditions for such\nattacks, and describe scheduler modifications to eliminate the vulnerability.\n  We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of these\ndefenses while imposing negligible overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 19:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-04"}

The\nultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fit by a\nblackbody with T ~ 1-2 x 10^4 K and peak bolometric luminosity L_BB ~ 1-5 x\n10^44 erg per s (depending on the details of the extinction correction). A\ncomparable amount of energy is radiated in the X-ray band that appears to\nresult from a distinct physical process. The location of PTF10iya is consistent\nwith the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z = 0.22405 +/- 0.00006) to within\n350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than\n1.2 kpc. At first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of the\ncharacteristic \"big blue bump\" seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of many\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, emission-line diagnostics of the host\ngalaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show no\nevidence for AGN-like activity. We therefore consider whether the tidal\ndisruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole may\naccount for our observations. Though with limited temporal information,\nPTF10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early\n\"super-Eddington\" phase of a solar-type star disrupted by a ~ 10^7 M_sun black\nhole.

The results for the four-particle\namplitudes are verified by tree-level perturbative computations and a unitarity\nbased construction of the integrand corresponding to the leading perturbative\ncorrection is also presented for the N=8 theory. For N=8 SYM, the manifest\nSO(8) symmetry is used to develop a map between the color-ordered amplitudes of\nthe SYM and superconformal Chern-Simons theories, providing a direct connection\nbetween on-shell observables of D2 and M2-brane theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 21:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-03"}

The X-ray spectra can be\nwell fitted by an attenuated three temperature thermal plasma model,\ncharacterised by cool, moderate, and hot plasma components at kT ~ 0.2, 0.7,\nand 2 keV, respectively, and a circumstellar absorption of ~ 0.2 x 10^22 cm-2.\nAlthough the hot plasma component could be indicating the presence of wind-wind\ncollision shocks in the system, the model fluxes calculated from spectral fits,\nwith an average value of ~ 7 x 10^-13 erg s-1 cm-2, do not show a clear\ncorrelation with the orbits of the two constituent binaries.

The model of differential privacy allows such private release while\nproviding strong guarantees on the output. A basic mechanism achieves\ndifferential privacy by adding noise to the frequency counts in the contingency\ntables (or, a subset of the count data cube) derived from the dataset. However,\nwhen the dataset is sparse in its underlying space, as is the case for most\nmulti-attribute relations, then the effect of adding noise is to vastly\nincrease the size of the published data: it implicitly creates a huge number of\ndummy data points to mask the true data, making it almost impossible to work\nwith.\n  We present techniques to overcome this roadblock and allow efficient private\nrelease of sparse data, while maintaining the guarantees of differential\nprivacy. Our approach is to release a compact summary of the noisy data.\nGenerating the noisy data and then summarizing it would still be very costly,\nso we show how to shortcut this step, and instead directly generate the summary\nfrom the input data, without materializing the vast intermediate noisy data. We\ninstantiate this outline for a variety of sampling and filtering methods, and\nshow how to use the resulting summary for approximate, private, query\nanswering. Our experimental study shows that this is an effective, practical\nsolution, with comparable and occasionally improved utility over the costly\nmaterialization approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 05:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-07"}

We thus introduce a new criterion,\ntermed the asymptotic multiplexing gain, which captures the effect of\ninter-network interferences with different spectrum sensing setups. With this\nmetric, we clearly demonstrate that spectrum sensing can substantially improve\nprimary network performance when \\beta>1. On the contrary, spectrum sensing\nturns out to be unnecessary when \\beta<1 and setting the secondary network's\nALOHA parameter appropriately can substantially improve primary network\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 08:19:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 18:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 23:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}

The\nthickness dependence of $T_g$ is quantitatively captured by an equilibration\nmechanism based on free volume holes diffusion.

ALMA will be revolutionary in terms of increasing the detection rate\nand pushing the sensitivity limit down to include such galaxies, however the\nlimited FoV when observing at such high frequencies makes it difficult to use\nALMA for studies of the large-scale structure traced out by molecular gas in\ngalaxies. This article introduces a strategy for a systematic search for\nmolecular gas during the EoR (z~7 and above), capitalizing on the fact that the\nJ=1-0 transition of 12CO enters the upper bands of cm-wave instruments at\nhigh-z. The FoV advantage gained by observing at such frequencies, coupled with\nmodern broadband correlators allows significant cosmological volumes to be\nprobed on reasonable timescales. In this article we present an overview of our\nfuture observing programme which has been awarded 6,500 hours as one of the\nLarge Survey Projects for MeerKAT, the forthcoming South African SKA pathfinder\ninstrument. Its large FoV and correlator bandwidth, and high-sensitivity\nprovide unprecedented survey speed for such work. An existing astrophysical\nsimulation is coupled with instrumental considerations to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of such observations and predict detection rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 10:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 13:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-08"}

Two methodological perspectives on theory construction,\nEinstein's division into principle and constructive theories, are then\ndelineated along the lines of their metaphysical and explanatory potential, and\npresented as the research instrument with which to approach the\nspecific-case-study instances of quantum theory reconstruction. A specific\nstrategy of arguing for scientific realism ('the simple transcendental\nstrategy') is then presented and connected to the challenges that the phenomena\n(EPR correlations and 'teleportation') from the domain of contemporary quantum\ntheory pose for it. The opening chapter concludes with a survey of the general\nmodels of explanation and their position with respect to the\nprinciple-constructive dichotomy introduced above. Finally, an explanatory\nmodel containing extended material-like entities along with further primitives,\nuniversal laws of temporal evolution, is argued for. Consequently, in the\ninterest of a wholesome realistic response to the sceptical challenge about the\nexplanatory aims of science, we recommend that even the common sense conceptual\nframework replaces the extended material structure with 'generalised things' as\nre-identifiable invariants through change as the fundamental unit of the\nrealist ontology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 11:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-07"}

The success of\nthese methods is attributed to the fact that their discriminative models are\nable to account for overlapping features on the whole input observations. These\nfeatures are usually generated by applying a given set of templates on labeled\ndata, but improper templates may lead to degraded performance. To alleviate\nthis issue, in this paper, we propose a novel multiple template learning\nparadigm to learn structured prediction and the importance of each template\nsimultaneously, so that hundreds of arbitrary templates could be added into the\nlearning model without caution. This paradigm can be formulated as a special\nmultiple kernel learning problem with exponential number of constraints. Then\nwe introduce an efficient cutting plane algorithm to solve this problem in the\nprimal, and its convergence is presented. We also evaluate the proposed\nlearning paradigm on two widely-studied structured prediction tasks,\n\\emph{i.e.} sequence labeling and dependency parsing. Extensive experimental\nresults show that the proposed method outperforms CRFs and Structural SVMs due\nto exploiting the importance of each template. Our complexity analysis and\nempirical results also show that our proposed method is more efficient than\nOnlineMKL on very sparse and high-dimensional data.

The statistics of records in symmetric random\nwalks was previously analyzed by Majumdar and Ziff and is well understood.\nUnlike the case of symmetric jump distributions, in the asymmetric case the\nstatistics of records depends on the choice of the jump distribution. We\ncompute the record rate $P_n(c)$, defined as the probability for the $n$th\nvalue to be larger than all previous values, for a Gaussian jump distribution\nwith standard deviation $\\sigma$ that is shifted by a constant drift $c$. For\nsmall drift, in the sense of $c/\\sigma \\ll n^{-1/2}$, the correction to\n$P_n(c)$ grows proportional to arctan$(\\sqrt{n})$ and saturates at the value\n$\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2} \\sigma}$.

Our analysis seeks to assemble a control sample of\ngalaxies suitable for providing absolute measures of the HI content of gaseous\nobjects.

New\nmeasurement methods can measure concentrations for all molecular species in a\npathway, which creates a new opportunity to decompose the optimization of rate\nparameters. Results: In contrast with conventional methods that minimize the\ndisagreement between simulated and observed concentrations, the BPPE method\nfits a spline curve through the observed concentration points, and then matches\nthe derivatives of the spline-curve to the production and consumption of each\nspecies. Whereas traditional methods follow the ODEs exactly and then attempt\nto match the data, BPPE follows the data exactly and then attempts to match the\nODEs. The new objective function is an extreme decomposition of the problem\nbecause each factor in the function is enforcing the equality of one ODE at one\ntimeslice. A \"loopy belief propagation\" algorithm solves this factorized\napproximation of the parameter estimation problem providing systematic coverage\nof the search space and unique asymptotic behavior; the run time is polynomial\nin the number of molecules and timepoints, but exponential in the degree of the\nbiochemical network. The implementation is a global-local hybrid optimization,\nand we compare with the performance of local, global, and hybrid methods.

This autoreferential\nKripke semantics, which has the possibility of flattening higher-order Herbrand\ninterpretations into ordinary 2-valued Herbrand interpretations, gives us a\nclearer insight into the relationship between many-valued and 2-valued\nmulti-modal logics. This methodology is applied to the class of many-valued\nLogic Programs, where reduction is done in a structural way, based on the logic\nstructure (logic connectives) of original many-valued logics. Following this,\nwe generalize the reduction to general structural many-valued logics, in an\nabstract way, based on Suszko's informal non-constructive idea. In all cases,\nby using developed 2-valued reductions we obtain a kind of non truth-valued\nmodal meta-logics, where two-valued formulae are modal sentences obtained by\napplication of particular modal operators to original many-valued formulae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 15:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-07"}

Percolation, the transition to extensive connectedness upon gradual\naddition of links, was long believed to be continuous but recent numerical\nevidence on \"explosive percolation\" suggests that it might as well be\ndiscontinuous if links compete for addition. Here we analyze the microscopic\nmechanisms underlying discontinuous percolation processes and reveal a strong\nimpact of single link additions. We show that in generic competitive\npercolation processes, including those displaying explosive percolation, single\nlinks do not induce a discontinuous gap in the largest cluster size in the\nthermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, our results highlight that for large finite\nsystems single links may still induce observable gaps because gap sizes scale\nweakly algebraically with system size. Several essentially macroscopic clusters\ncoexist immediately before the transition, thus announcing discontinuous\npercolation. These results explain how single links may drastically change\nmacroscopic connectivity in networks where links add competitively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 15:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-07"}

This\ndiagram contains both synchronized states, where the individual particles\nfollow the field with (on average) constant phase difference, and asynchronous\nstates. The synchronization is accompanied by layer formation, i.e. by spatial\nsymmetry-breaking, similar to systems of induced dipoles in rotating fields. In\nthe permanent-dipole case, however, too large $\\omega_0$ yield a breakdown of\nlayering, supplemented by complex changes of the single-particle rotational\ndynamics from synchronous to asynchronous behavior. We show that the limit\nfrequencies $\\omega_c$ can be well described as a bifurcation in the nonlinear\nequation of motion of a single particle rotating in a viscous medium.

A qubit induces an effective coupling between two externally\npumped cavity modes. Without cavity losses and in the dispersive regime,\nintrinsic Josephson oscillations of photons between the two modes occurs. In\nthis case, contrary to regular Markovian decoherence, the qubit purity shows a\nGaussian decay and recurrence of its coherence. Due to intrinsic\nnon-linearities, both the Josephson oscillations as well as the qubit\nproperties display a rich collapse-revival structure, where, however, the\ncomplexity of the qubit evolution is in some sense stronger. The qubit as a\nmeter of the photon dynamics is considered, and it is shown that qubit\ndephasing, originating for example from non-demolition measurements, results in\nan exponential destruction of the oscillations which manifests the\ncollectiveness of the Josephson effect. Non-selective qubit measurements, on\nthe other hand, render a Zeno effect seen in a slowing down of the Josephson\noscillations. Contrary to dephasing, cavity dissipation results in a Gaussian\ndecay of the scaled Josephson oscillations. Finally, following Ponomarev et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 010405 (2011)] we analyze aspects of thermalization. In\nparticular, despite similarities with the generic model studied by Ponomarev\n{\\it et al.}, our system does not seem to thermalize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 15:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}
