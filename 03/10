By this comparison, we stress that symmetries must be understood in\nrelation to conservation and stability properties, as represented in the\ntheories. We posit that the dynamics of biological organisms, in their various\nlevels of organization, are not \"just\" processes, but permanent (extended, in\nour terminology) critical transitions and, thus, symmetry changes. Within the\nlimits of a relative structural stability (or interval of viability),\nvariability is at the core of these transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 17:08:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 03:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-09"}

Furthermore, the presence of spin-orbit interactions leads to the\noccurrence of an additional polarization among time-reversal electronic states\n(polarization in the time-reversal symmetry or Kramers sector).

It is demonstrated that such short\nrecurrence times are destroyed as the nonlinear interaction is strengthened.\nThe similar loss of Poincar\\'e recurrence is also reported in 3D QT [1] Energy\ncascades for 2D QT are considered to examine whether 2D QT exhibits inverse\ncascades as in 2D classical turbulence. In the parameter regime considered, the\nspectra analysis reveals no such dual cascades-dual cascades being a hallmark\nof 2D classical turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 18:53:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 16:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Long space-time dynamics\nis derived using a perturbation expansion in the ratio of the nearest-neighbor\ndistance to a nanometer-scale characteristic length, and a theorem on the\nequivalence of long-time averages and expectation values. This dynamics is\nshown to satisfy a coarse-grained wave equation (CGWE) which takes a\nSchr\\\"odinger-like form with modified masses and interactions. The scaling of\nspace and time is determined by the orders of magnitude of various\ncontributions to the N-body potential. If the spatial scale of the\ncoarse-graining is too large, the CGWE would imply an unbounded growth of\ngradients; if it is too short, the system's size would display uncontrolled\ngrowth inappropriate for the bound states of interest, i.e., collective motion\nor migration within a stable nano-assembly. The balance of these two extremes\nremoves arbitrariness in the choice of the scaling of space-time. Since the\nlong-scale dynamics of each fermion involves its interaction with many others,\nwe hypothesize that the solutions of the CGWE have mean-field character to good\napproximation, i.e., can be factorized into single-particle functions. This\nleads to a Coarse-grained Mean-field (CGMF) approximation that is distinct in\ncharacter from traditional Hartree-Fock theory. A variational principle is used\nto derive equations for the single-particle functions.

Given its known age, distance, and\nspectral type, 2MASS 1207 b is under-luminous by a factor of ~10 (~2.5 mags)\nwhen compared to standard models of brown-dwarf/giant-planet evolution. In this\npaper, we study three possible sources of 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity.\nFirst, we investigate Mohanty et al. (2007)'s hypothesis that a near edge-on\ndisk might be responsible for 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity. We conclude that\nthe hypothesis is unlikely due to the lack of variability seen in multi-epoch\nphotometry and unnecessary due to the increasing sample of under-luminous\nbrown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets that cannot be explained by an edge-on disk.\nNext, we test the analogous possibility that a spherical shell of dust, could\nexplain 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity. Models containing enough dust to\ncreate ~2.5 mags of extinction, placed at reasonable radii, are ruled out by\nour new Gemini/T-ReCS 8.7 micron photometric upper-limit for 2MASS 1207 b.\nFinally, we investigate the possibility that 2MASS 1207 b is intrinsically\ncooler than the commonly used AMES-DUSTY fits to its spectrum, and thus it is\nnot, in fact, under-luminous. New, thick cloud model grids by Madhusudhan et\nal. (2011) fit 2MASS 1207 b's 1-10 micron SED well, but they do not quite fit\nits near-infrared spectrum. However, we suggest that with some \"tuning\", they\nmight be capable of simultaneously reproducing 2MASS 1207 b's spectral shape\nand luminosity. In this case, the whole class of young, under-luminous\nbrown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets might be explained by atmospheres that are able\nto suspend thick, dusty clouds in their photospheres at lower temperatures than\nfield brown-dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 21:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

This includes 1198 galaxies with 0.005 <\nz < (z_em - 0.01) at a median redshift of 0.18, which may associated with IGM\nabsorption lines. All of the imaging was acquired with cameras on the Swope 40\"\ntelescope and the spectra were obtained via slitmask observations using the\nWFCCD spectrograph on the Dupont 100\" telescope at Las Campanas Observatory\n(LCO). This paper describes the data reduction, imaging analysis, photometry,\nand spectral analysis of the survey. We tabulate the principal measurements for\nall sources in each field and provide the spectroscopic dataset online.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 21:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The behavior of the perturbed Hubble\nflow around the Milky Way is the result of two main factors: at small scales (R\n< 1 Mpc) the inflow is dominated by the gravitational influence of the Milky\nWay. At large scales (R > 1 Mpc) the out flow reflects the expansion of our\nlocal wall which \"cools down\" the peculiar velocities.

Although intensely\nstudied for decades the interplay of many length scales has prevented a\ncomplete resolution of some of the basic questions such as how the\nelectrostatic persistence length ($l_e$) varies with ionic strength ($I$). In\nthis review we describe certain characteristics of polyelectrolytes (PAs) and\npolyampholytes (PAs), which are polymers whose monomers have a random\ndistribution of opposite charges. After reviewing the current theoretical\nunderstanding of the dependence of $l_e$ on $I$ we present experimental data\nthat conform to two distinct behavior. For RNA and DNA it is found that that\n$l_e \\sim I^{-1}$ whereas for some proteins and other polyelectrolytes $l_e\n\\sim i^{-1/2}$. A scaling type theory, which delineates charge correlation and\npure polyelectrolyte effects for the shape of PAs that is valid over a wide\nrange of salt concentration is described. We also use theory and simulations to\nargue that the distinct stages in the kinetics of collapse of PAs (with a net\ncharge that is small enough to induce globule formation) and PEs (relevant for\nRNA folding) are similar. In both cases the major initial conformation change\ninvolves formation of metastable pearl-necklace structures. In the coarsening\nprocess large clusters (pearls) grow at the expense of smaller ones by a\nprocess that is reminiscent of Lifshitz-Slyozov mechanism. Finally, recent\ntheories and single molecule experiments on stretching of single stranded DNA\nand PEs further sheds insights into the complex behavior of charged\nmacromolecules. The survey, which is limited to very few topics, shows the\nimportance of polyelectrolyte effects in a wide range of disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 22:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-11"}

Based on\nthe remarkable ability of vortex coronagraphs to move light between the\ninterior and exterior of pupils, we propose a method, based on multiple\nvortices, that, without sacrificing throughput, reduces the residual light\nleakage to (a/A)^n, with n >=4, and a and A being the radii of the central\nobscuration and primary mirror, respectively. This method thus enables high\ncontrasts to be reached even with an on-axis telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 22:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

A graph is C_4-dominated when every cycle of\nlength 4 contains a vertex that is dominated by the vertex of the cycle that is\nnot adjacent to it. In this paper we show that the class of hereditary\nbiclique-Helly graphs is formed precisely by those C_4-dominated graphs that\ncontain no triangles and no induced cycles of length either 5, or 6.

In either case, the plate is\nstabilised by a combination of viscous resistance, surface tension and buoyancy\nrelative to an underlying denser fluid. In the limit of vanishing thickness,\nplates buckle at a shear rate $\\gamma/(\\mu d)$ independent of buoyancy, where\n2d is the plate thickness, $\\gamma$ is the average surface tension between the\nupper and lower surfaces and $\\mu$ is the fluid viscosity. For thicker plates\nstabilised by an equal surface tension at the upper and lower surfaces, at and\nabove onset, the most unstable mode has moderate wavelength, is stationary in\nthe frame of the centre-line, spans the width of the plate with crests and\ntroughs aligned at approximately $45^\\circ$ to the walls and closely resembles\nelastic shear modes. The thickest plates that can buckle have an aspect ratio\n(thickness/width) approximately $\\EC$ and are stabilised only by internal\nviscous resistance. We show that the viscous plate model can only accurately\ndescribe the onset of buckling for vanishingly thin plates but provides an\nexcellent description of the most unstable mode above onset. Finally, we show\nthat by modifying the plate model to incorporate advection and make the model\nmaterial frame-invariant, it is possible to extend its predictive power to\ndescribe relatively short, travelling waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 02:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-11"}

Most mass spectrometric imagers\nacquire high mass resolution spectra spot-by-spot and thereby scan the object's\nsurface. Thus, imaging is slow and image reconstruction remains cumbersome.\nHere we describe an imaging mass spectrometer that exploits the true imaging\ncapabilities by ion optical means for the time of flight mass separation. The\nmass spectrometer is equipped with the ASIC Timepix chip as an array detector\nto acquire the position, mass, and intensity of ions that are imaged by MALDI\ndirectly from the target sample onto the detector. This imaging mass\nspectrometer has a spatial resolving power at the specimen of (84\\pm35) \\mu m\nwith a mass resolution of 45 and locates atoms or organic compounds on a\nsurface area up to ~2 cm2. Extended laser spots of ~5 mm2 on structured\nspecimens allowed parallel imaging of selected masses. The digital imaging mass\nspectrometer proves high hit-multiplicity, straightforward image reconstruction\nand its potential for high-speed readout at 4 kHz or more. This device\ndemonstrates a simple way of true image acquisition like a digital photographic\ncamera.

Second, we introduce a notion of \"almost implication\" and \"almost\ntruth\" (somewhat similar to what is done in fuzzy logic) which allows, once the\nfoundations of Malliavin calculus are laid out, to give a very short and\nstreamlined proof of H\\\"ormader's theorem that focuses on the main ideas\nwithout clouding it by technical details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 11:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-11"}

Here I show that this perspective can be quantified using\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics. Generating disequilibrium in a thermodynamic\nvariable requires the extraction of power from another thermodynamic gradient,\nand the second law of thermodynamics imposes fundamental limits on how much\npower can be extracted. When applied to complex earth system processes, where\nseveral irreversible processes compete to deplete the same gradients, it is\neasily shown that the maximum thermodynamic efficiency is much less than the\nclassic Carnot limit, so that the ability of the earth system to generate power\nand disequilibrium is limited. This approach is used to quantify how much free\nenergy is generated by various earth system processes to generate chemical\ndisequilibrium. It is shown that surface life generates orders of magnitude\nmore chemical free energy than any abiotic surface process, therefore being the\nprimary driving force for shaping the geochemical environment at the planetary\nscale. To apply this perspective to the possible future of the planet, we first\nnote that the free energy consumption by human activity is a considerable term\nin the free energy budget of the planet, and that global changes are closely\nrelated to this consumption of free energy. Since human activity and demands\nfor free energy is going to increase in the future, the central question is how\nhuman free energy demands can increase sustainably without negatively impacting\nthe ability of the earth system to generate free energy. I illustrate the\nimplications of this thermodynamic perspective by discussing the forms of\nrenewable energy and planetary engineering that would enhance overall free\nenergy generation and thereby \"empower\" the future of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 12:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2011 21:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We\ninvestigate the following question: what fraction of the capacity can we\nmaintain by using only k out of the N available relays? We show that\nindependent of the channel configurations and the operating SNR, we can always\nfind a subset of k relays which alone provide a rate (kC/(k+1))-G, where C is\nthe information theoretic cutset upper bound on the capacity of the whole\nnetwork and G is a constant that depends only on N and k (logarithmic in N and\nlinear in k). In particular, for k = 1, this means that half of the capacity of\nany N-relay diamond network can be approximately achieved by routing\ninformation over a single relay. We also show that this fraction is tight:\nthere are configurations of the N-relay diamond network where every subset of k\nrelays alone can at most provide approximately a fraction k/(k+1) of the total\ncapacity. These high-capacity k-relay subnetworks can be also discovered\nefficiently. We propose an algorithm that computes a constant gap approximation\nto the capacity of the Gaussian N-relay diamond network in O(N log N) running\ntime and discovers a high-capacity k-relay subnetwork in O(kN) running time.\n  This result also provides a new approximation to the capacity of the Gaussian\nN-relay diamond network which is hybrid in nature: it has both multiplicative\nand additive gaps. In the intermediate SNR regime, this hybrid approximation is\ntighter than existing purely additive or purely multiplicative approximations\nto the capacity of this network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 14:25:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 21:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}

We connect\nthe non-interacting limit to the Thomas-Fermi limit. We also consider the case\nof attractive self-interaction.

A synopsis of each argument is presented here, with discussion and\nanalysis. Seen through Riccioli's 126 arguments, the debate over the Copernican\nhypothesis appears dynamic and indeed similar to more modern scientific\ndebates. Both sides present good arguments as point and counter-point.\nReligious arguments play a minor role in the debate; careful, reproducible\nexperiments a major role. To Riccioli, the anti-Copernican arguments carry the\ngreater weight, on the basis of a few key arguments against which the\nCopernicans have no good response. These include arguments based on telescopic\nobservations of stars, and on the apparent absence of what today would be\ncalled \"Coriolis Effect\" phenomena; both have been overlooked by the historical\nrecord (which paints a picture of the 126 arguments that little resembles\nthem). Given the available scientific knowledge in 1651, a geo-heliocentric\nhypothesis clearly had real strength, but Riccioli presents it as merely the\n\"least absurd\" available model - perhaps comparable to the Standard Model in\nparticle physics today - and not as a fully coherent theory. Riccioli's work\nsheds light on a fascinating piece of the history of astronomy, and highlights\nthe competence of scientists of his time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 15:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 14:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-22"}

Candidate YSOs were identified via\ninfrared (IR) excess emission from dusty circumstellar disks and envelopes,\nusing data from the Spitzer Space Telescope Vela--Carina survey and the\nTwo-Micron All Sky Survey. We model the 1--24 /mu m IR spectral energy\ndistributions of the YSOs to constrain physical properties. Our Pan-Carina YSO\nCatalog (PCYC) is dominated by intermediate-mass (2 Msun < m < 10 Msun) objects\nwith disks, including Herbig Ae/Be stars and their less evolved progenitors.\nThe PCYC provides a valuable complementary dataset to the CCCP X-ray source\ncatalogs, identifying 1029 YSOs in Carina with no X-ray detection. We also\ncatalog 410 YSOs with X-ray counterparts, including 62 candidate protostars.\nCandidate protostars with X-ray detections tend to be more evolved than those\nwithout. In most cases, X-ray emission apparently originating from\nintermediate-mass, disk-dominated YSOs is consistent with the presence of\nlow-mass companions, but we also find that X-ray emission correlates with\ncooler stellar photospheres and higher disk masses. We suggest that\nintermediate-mass YSOs produce X-rays during their early pre-main sequence\nevolution, perhaps driven by magnetic dynamo activity during the convective\natmosphere phase, but this emission dies off as the stars approach the main\nsequence. Extrapolating over the stellar initial mass function scaled to the\nPCYC population, we predict a total population of >2x10^4 YSOs and a\npresent-day star formation rate (SFR) of >0.008 Msun/yr. The global SFR in the\nCarina Nebula, averaged over the past ~5 Myr, has been approximately constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 15:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
