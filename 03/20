This paper presents a new algorithm for the image\nencryption/decryption scheme. This paper is devoted to provide a secured image\nencryption technique using multiple chaotic based circular mapping. In this\npaper, first, a pair of sub keys is given by using chaotic logistic maps.\nSecond, the image is encrypted using logistic map sub key and in its\ntransformation leads to diffusion process. Third, sub keys are generated by\nfour different chaotic maps. Based on the initial conditions, each map may\nproduce various random numbers from various orbits of the maps. Among those\nrandom numbers, a particular number and from a particular orbit are selected as\na key for the encryption algorithm. Based on the key, a binary sequence is\ngenerated to control the encryption algorithm. The input image of 2-D is\ntransformed into a 1- D array by using two different scanning pattern (raster\nand Zigzag) and then divided into various sub blocks. Then the position\npermutation and value permutation is applied to each binary matrix based on\nmultiple chaos maps. Finally the receiver uses the same sub keys to decrypt the\nencrypted images. The salient features of the proposed image encryption method\nare loss-less, good peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), Symmetric key\nencryption, less cross correlation, very large number of secret keys, and\nkey-dependent pixel value replacement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2011 16:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

The data employed extends to 2-3 disc scalelengths, with\nS/N(A)>50. Several techniques are explored to derive star formation histories\nand SSP-equivalent parameters, each of which are shown to be compatible. We\ndemostrate that the age-metallicity degeneracy is highly reduced by using\nspectral fitting techniques --instead of indices-- to derive these parameters.\nWe found that the majority of the stellar mass in our sample is composed of old\n(~10 Gyr) stars. This is true in the bulge and the disc region, even beyond two\ndisc scalelengths. In the bulge region, we find that the young, dynamically\ncold, structures produced by the presence of the bar (e.g., nuclear discs or\nrings) are responsible for shaping the bulges' age and metallicity gradients.\nIn the disc region, a larger fraction of young stars is present in the external\nparts of the disc compared with the inner disc. The disc growth is, therefore,\ncompatible with a moderate inside-out formation scenario, where the luminosity\nweighted age changes from ~10 Gyrs in the centre, to ~4 Gyrs at two disc\nscalelengths, depending upon the galaxy. For two galaxies, we compare the\nmetallicity and age gradients of the disc major axis with that of the bar,\nfinding very important differences. In particular, the stellar population of\nthe bar is more similar to the bulge than to the disc, indicating that, at\nleast in those two galaxies, bars formed long ago and have survived to the\npresent day.

The results of this manuscript has been merged and published with\nanother paper of the same authors: A new approach to nonrepetitve sequences.)\n  A repetition of size $h$ ($h\\geqslant1$) in a given sequence is a subsequence\nof consecutive terms of the form: $xx=x_1... x_hx_1... x_h$. A sequence is\nnonrepetitive if it does not contain a repetition of any size. The remarkable\nconstruction of Thue asserts that 3 different symbols are enough to build an\narbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequence. We consider game-theoretic versions of\nresults on nonrepetitive sequences. A nonrepetitive game is played by two\nplayers who pick, one by one, consecutive terms of a sequence over a given set\nof symbols. The first player tries to avoid repetitions, while the second\nplayer, in contrast, wants to create them. Of course, by simple imitation, the\nsecond player can force lots of repetitions of size 1. However, as proved by\nPegden, there is a strategy for the first player to build an arbitrarily long\nsequence over 37 symbols with no repetitions of size $>1$. Our techniques allow\nto reduce 37 to 6. Another game we consider is an erase-repetition game. Here,\nwhenever a repetition occurs, the repeated block is immediately erased and the\nnext player to move continues the play. We prove that there is a strategy for\nthe first player to build an arbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequence over 8\nsymbols.

We consider Hilbert spaces of prime power dimension (as realized by\nsystems of N prime-state particles, or qupits), where full complements are\nknown to exist, and we assume only that MUBs are eigenbases of generalized\nPauli operators, without using a particular construction. The general rules\ninclude the following: 1) In any MUB, a particular qupit appears either in a\npure state, or totally entangled, and 2) in any full MUB complement, each qupit\nis pure in p+1 bases (not necessarily the same ones), and totally entangled in\nthe remaining p^N-p. It follows that the maximum number of product bases is\np+1, and when this number is realized, all remaining p^N-p bases in the\ncomplement are characterized by the total entanglement of every qupit. This\n\"standard distribution\" is inescapable for two qupits (of any p), where only\nproduct and generalized Bell bases are admissible MUB types. This and the\nfollowing results generalize previous results for qubits and qutrits. With\nthree qupits there are three MUB types, and a number of combinations (p+2) are\npossible in full complements. With N=4, there are 6 MUB types for p=2, but new\nMUB types become possible with larger p, and these are essential to the\nrealization of full complements.
