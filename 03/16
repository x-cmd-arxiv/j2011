In the hard state, the dominant spectral\nvariability is a changing of normalisation with fixed spectral shape, while in\nthe intermediate state the slope changes, with a pivot point around 10 keV. In\nthe soft state, the low energy X-ray emission dominates the bolometric flux\nwhich is only loosely correlated with the high energy emission. In black hole\nbinaries in the hard state, the radio flux is generally found to depend on a\npower of the X-ray flux, F_R ~ F_X^p. We confirm this for Cyg X-1. Our new\nfinding is that this correlation extends to the intermediate and soft states\nprovided the broad-band X-ray flux in the Comptonization part of the spectrum\n(excluding the blackbody component) is considered instead of a narrow-band\nmedium-energy X-ray flux. We find an index p=1.7+-0.1 for 15 GHz radio\nemission, decreasing to p=1.5+-0. at 2.25 GHz. We conclude that the higher\nvalue at 15 GHz is due to the effect of free-free absorption in the wind from\nthe companion. The intrinsic correlation index remains uncertain. However,\nbased on a theoretical model of the wind in Cyg X-1, it appears to be close to\n1.3, which, in the framework of accretion/jet models, implies that the\naccretion flow in Cyg X-1 is radiatively efficient. The correlation with the\nflux due to Comptonization emission indicates that the radio jet is launched by\nthe hot electrons in the accretion flow in all spectral states of Cyg X-1. On\nthe other hand, we rule out the X-ray jet model. Finally, we find that the\nindex of the correlation, when measured using the X-ray flux in a narrow energy\nband, strongly depends on the band chosen and is, in general, different from\nthat for either the bolometric flux or the flux in the hot-electron emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 18:30:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 12:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Current limits imply\na dipole magnetic field strength of less than 7.5 x 10^{12} G (Rea et al.\n2010), which is significantly smaller than that of a typical SGR. Independent\nof the properties inferred from X-ray timing, the X-ray spectra of neutron\nstars allow a measurement of their magnetic field strengths because they are\ndistorted from pure blackbodies due to the presence of a magnetic field in a\nradiative equilibrium atmosphere. In this paper, we model high signal-to-noise\nXMM-Newton spectra of SGR 0418+5729 to place constraints on the strength of the\nmagnetic field at the surface of the neutron star.

We find that the\nstrength of the magnetic field at the surface is 1.0 x 10^{14} G.

TMT planned to monitor PWV at the sites of interest by means of\nusing infrared radiometers. Technical failures and calibration issues prevented\nthem from having a sufficiently long PWV time-series to characterize the sites\nusing this method. Therefore, for the sites in Chile TMT used surface water\nvapor density measurements, which taken together with an assumed water vapor\nscale height, allowed for the estimation of PWV. On the other hand, the E-ELT\nteam conducted dedicated PWV measurement campaigns at two of their observatory\nsites using radiosonde soundings to validate historical time-series of PWV\nreconstructed by way of a spectroscopic analysis of astronomical standard\nsources observed at the La Silla and the Paranal sites.

In the case of the Armazones site, the published median of PWV by\nboth groups differ by about 1 mm with the E-ELT values being drier than those\nestimated by the TMT group.

Starting from the\nfirst-principle Liouville equation and applying the Mori-Zwanzig projection\noperator technique, we derive the Generalized Langevin Equations (GLE) for the\ncoarse-grained representations of the liquid. The chosen slow variables in the\nprojection operators define the length scale of coarse graining.

In the long-time regime where the\ncenter-of-mass follows Brownian motion and the internal dynamics is completely\nrelaxed, the two descriptions must be equivalent. By enforcing this formal\nrelation we derive from the GLEs the analytical rescaling factors to be applied\nto dynamical data in the coarse-grained representation to recover the monomeric\ndescription.

We\nexplore the effects of an off-center initiated detonation on the spatial\ndistribution of the nucleosynthetic yield products in a toy model -- a\npre-expanded near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. We find that a single-point\nnear edge-lit detonation results in asymmetries in the density and thermal\nprofiles, notably the expansion timescale, throughout the supernova ejecta. We\ndemonstrate that this asymmetry of the thermodynamic trajectories should be\ncommon to off-center detonations where a small amount of the star is burned\nprior to detonation. The sensitivity of the yields on the expansion timescale\nresults in an asymmetric distribution of the elements synthesized as reaction\nproducts. We tabulate the shift in the center of mass of the various elements\nproduced in our model supernova and find an odd-even pattern for elements past\nsilicon.

We\nconsider an underlying potential, as defined theoretically for a saddle-node\nfold and (via averaging) for a Hopf bifurcation. Close to a stable state, this\npotential has a parabolic form; but approaching a jump it becomes increasingly\ndominated by softening nonlinearities. If we have already detected a decrease\nin the linear decay rate, nonlinear information allows us to estimate the\npropensity for early tipping due to noise. We argue that one needs to extract\ninformation about the nonlinear features (a \"softening\") of the underlying\npotential from the time series to judge the probability and timing of tipping.\nThis analysis is the logical next step if one has detected a decrease of the\nlinear decay rate. If there is no discernable trend in the linear analysis,\nnonlinear softening is even more important in showing the proximity to tipping.\nAfter extensive normal form calibration studies, we check two geological time\nseries from paleo-climate tipping events for softening of the underlying well.\nFor the ending of the last ice age, where we find no convincing linear\nprecursor, we identify a statistically significant nonlinear softening towards\nincreasing temperature.

For the first time for such\nmodels, an optically thick inner gas disk extends inside the dust destruction\nfront. This is important to conserve the accretion energy naturally and for its\nshielding effect on the outer region of the disk and envelope.

Images are also presented in different wavebands of various\ntelescope cameras, including Spitzer IRAC and MIPS, SOFIA FORCAST and Herschel\nPACS and SPIRE. The existence of the optically thick inner disk produces higher\noptical wavelength fluxes but reduces near- and mid-IR emission. The presence\nof outflow cavities, the inclination angle to the line of sight, and the\nthickness of the disk all affect the SEDs and images significantly.

With lower surface pressures, the core is larger,\nhas lower extinction and accretion rates, and the observed mid-IR flux from the\ndisk can then be relatively high even though the accretion luminosity is lower.\nIn this case the silicate absorption feature becomes prominent, in contrast to\nhigher density cores forming under higher pressures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 23:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The quantum computer could be used for execution of very complicated\ntasks which are not solvable with the classical computers.

However, it suffers from the decoherent processes and it is desirable\nto find more practical encoding of qubits with long-lived coherence. It could\nbe single impurity or vacancy centers in solids, but their interaction with\nelectromagnetic radiation is rather weak. So, here, ensembles of atoms were\nproposed for the qubit encoding by using the dipole blockade mechanism in order\nto turn multilevel systems in two level ones. But dipole-dipole based blockade\nintroduces an additional decoherence that limits its practical significance.\nRecently, the collective blockade mechanism has been proposed for the system of\nthree-level atoms by using the different frequency shifts for the Raman\ntransitions between the collective atomic states characterized by a different\nnumber of the excited atoms.

Under\nstrongly irradiated conditions, models of tidally locked, short-period planets\n(both hot Jupiters and terrestrial planets) tend to exhibit a circulation\ndominated by a fast eastward, or \"superrotating,\" jet stream at the equator.\nUnder appropriate conditions, this phenomenon can cause the hottest regions to\nbe displaced eastward from the substellar point by tens of degrees longitude.\nSuch an offset has been observed on HD 189733b, supporting the possibility of\nequatorial jets on short-period exoplanets. Despite its relevance, however, the\ndynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the equatorial superrotation in\nsuch models have not been identified. Here, we show that the equatorial jet\nresults from the interaction of the mean flow with standing, planetary-scale\nRossby and Kelvin waves induced by the day-night thermal forcing. The Rossby\nwaves develop phase tilts that pump eastward momentum from high latitudes to\nthe equator, thereby inducing equatorial superrotation. We present an analytic\ntheory demonstrating this mechanism and explore its properties in a hierarchy\nof one-layer (shallow-water) calculations and fully 3D models. The\nwave-mean-flow interaction produces an equatorial jet whose latitudinal width\nis comparable to that of the Rossby waves, namely the equatorial Rossby\ndeformation radius modified by radiative and frictional effects. For conditions\ntypical of synchronously rotating hot Jupiters, this length is comparable to a\nplanetary radius, explaining the broad scale of the equatorial jet obtained in\nmost hot Jupiter models. Our theory illuminates the dependence of the\nequatorial jet speed on forcing amplitude, strength of friction, and other\nparameters, as well as the conditions under which jets can form at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 05:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 13:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In each fading slot, Alice broadcasts\na continuum of coded layers and, hence, allows Bob to decode at the rate\ncorresponding to the fading state (unknown to Alice). The index of a reliably\ndecoded layer is sent back from Bob to Alice via a public and error-free\nchannel and used to generate a common secret key.

This has provided a very convenient way to analyze the structure of\nindecomposable Virasoro modules and to obtain fusion rules for a variety of\nmodels such as (boundary) percolation etc. LCFTs allow for additional quantum\nnumbers describing the fine structure of the indecomposable modules, and\ngeneralizing the `b-number' introduced initially by Gurarie for the c=0 case.\nThe determination of these indecomposability parameters has given rise to a lot\nof algebraic work, but their physical meaning has remained somewhat elusive. In\na recent paper, a way to measure b for boundary percolation and polymers was\nproposed. We generalize this work here by devising a general strategy to\ncompute matrix elements of Virasoro generators from the numerical analysis of\nlattice models and their continuum limit. The method is applied to XXZ spin-1/2\nand spin-1 chains with open (free) boundary conditions. They are related to\ngl(n+m|m) and osp(n+2m|2m)-invariant superspin chains and to nonlinear sigma\nmodels with supercoset target spaces. These models can also be formulated in\nterms of dense and dilute loop gas. We check the method in many cases where the\nresults were already known analytically. Furthermore, we also confront our\nfindings with a construction generalizing Gurarie's, where logarithms emerge\nnaturally in operator product expansions to compensate for apparently divergent\nterms. This argument actually allows us to compute indecomposability parameters\nin any logarithmic theory. A central result of our study is the construction of\na Kac table for the indecomposability parameters of the logarithmic minimal\nmodels LM(1,p) and LM(p,p+1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 09:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 15:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 07:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-13"}

In the present study we consider an\nintermediate class of examples: Cayley graphs of cyclic groups, also known as\ncirculant graphs or multi-loop networks. We show that the diameter of a random\ncirculant 2k-regular graph with n vertices scales as n^{1/k}, and establish a\nlimit theorem for the distribution of their diameters. We obtain analogous\nresults for the distribution of the average distance and higher moments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 11:59:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 12:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

In the\npresent paper we investigate four flares which show clear quasi-periodic\nsequences of HXR pulses. We also describe our phenomenological model of\noscillating magnetic traps to show that it can explain observed properties of\nHXR oscillations. Main results are the following: 1. We have found that\nlow-amplitude quasi-periodic oscillations occur before impulsive phase of some\nflares. 2. We have found that quasi-period of the oscillations can change in\nsome flares.

During impulsive phase a significant part of the\nenergy of accelerated (non-thermal) electrons is deposited within the HXR\nloop-top source. 4.

The dark sector interaction in\nour scenario is free of the assumption that the interaction term $Q$ is\nproportional to the Hubble expansion rate and the energy densities of dark\nsectors. We only use a time-variable coupling $b(a)$ (with $a$ the scale factor\nof the universe) to characterize the interaction $Q$. We propose a\nparametrization form for the running coupling $b(a)=b_0a+b_e(1-a)$ in which the\nearly-time coupling is given by a constant $b_e$, while today the coupling is\ngiven by another constant, $b_0$. For investigating the feature of the running\ncoupling, we employ three dark energy models, namely, the cosmological constant\nmodel ($w=-1$), the constant $w$ model ($w=w_0$), and the time-dependent $w$\nmodel ($w(a)=w_0+w_1(1-a)$). We constrain the models with the current\nobservational data, including the type Ia supernova, the baryon acoustic\noscillation, the cosmic microwave background, the Hubble expansion rate, and\nthe X-ray gas mass fraction data. The fitting results indicate that a\ntime-varying vacuum scenario is favored, in which the coupling $b(z)$ crosses\nthe noninteracting line ($b=0$) during the cosmological evolution and the sign\nchanges from negative to positive. The crossing of the noninteracting line\nhappens at around $z=0.2-0.3$, and the crossing behavior is favored at about\n1$\\sigma$ confidence level.

We show using canonical Dirac\nfields in a curved spacetime, that the probability current has a Gordon\ndecomposition into a convection current and a spin current, and that the spin\ncurrent vanishes in the Whitham approximation, which explains the negligible\neffect of spin on wave packet solutions, independent of the size of Planck's\nconstant.

In strong precursors with sufficiently high\ndensities, the processes of charge exchange, excitation and ionization will\naffect the widths of both narrow and broad line components.

A large number of additional packages are continually contributed by an\nactive community. The purpose of this paper is to alert biomechanics\nresearchers to the usefulness of this versatile tool. We discuss a set of basic\nsignal processing methods and their realizations with R which are provided in\nthe supplementary material. The data used in the examples are EMG and force\nplate data acquired during a quiet standing test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 14:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 14:49:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 11:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

However, the overall spectrum of the EBL between 0.1 and 1000\nmicrons has never been determined directly neither from observed luminosity\nfunctions (LFs), over a wide redshift range, nor from any multiwavelength\nobservation of galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The evolving,\noverall spectrum of the EBL is derived here utilizing a novel method based on\nobservations only. The changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forming\ngalaxies, starburst galaxies and active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies from\nredshift 0.2 to 1 are estimated, and two alternative extrapolations of SED\ntypes to higher redshifts are considered. This allows calculation of the\nevolving EBL. The EBL uncertainties in our modelling based directly on the data\nare quantified, and their consequences for attenuation of very-high-energy\ngamma-rays due to pair production on the EBL are discussed. It is concluded\nthat the EBL seems well constrained from the UV to the mid-IR at an intensity\nlevel roughly matching galaxy count data. Independent efforts from IR and\ngamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in the\nfar-IR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-24"}
