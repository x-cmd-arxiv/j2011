In this paper, we\ncombine data from previously published stratified shearing box simulations and\nnew global disk simulations to calibrate several quantitative diagnostics by\nwhich one can estimate progress toward numerical convergence. Using these\ndiagnostics, we find that the established criterion for an adequate numerical\ndescription of linear growth of the magneto-rotational instability (the number\nof cells across a wavelength of the fastest-growing vertical wavenumber mode)\ncan be extended to a criterion for adequate description of nonlinear MHD disk\nturbulence, but the standard required is more stringent.

Otherwise, they tend to\nevolve to qualitatively similar states if evolved for sufficient time.

The search\nfor and characterisation of such breaks has been a major econometric task ever\nsince. We have developed an integral technique similar to CUSUM using an\nempirical model quantitatively linking the rate of inflation and unemployment\nto the change in the level of labour force in Canada. Inherently, our model\nbelongs to the class of Phillips curve models, and the link between the\ninvolved variables is a linear one with all coefficients of individual and\ngeneralized models obtained by empirical calibration. To achieve the best LSQ\nfit between measured and predicted time series cumulative curves are used as a\nsimplified version of the 1-D boundary elements (integral) method. The distance\nbetween the cumulative curves (in L2 metrics) is very sensitive to structural\nbreaks since it accumulates true differences and suppresses uncorrelated noise\nand systematic errors. Our previous model of inflation and unemployment in\nCanada is enhanced by the introduction of structural breaks and is validated by\nnew data in the past and future. The most exiting finding is that the\nintroduction of inflation targeting as a new monetary policy in 1991 resulted\nin a structural break manifested in a lowered rate of price inflation\naccompanied by a substantial fall in the rate of unemployment. Therefore, the\nnew monetary policy in Canada is a win-win one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 17:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-31"}

However, this complexity makes molecules\npotentially useful for many applications. For example, heteronuclear molecules\npossess permanent electric dipole moments which lead to long-range, tunable,\nanisotropic dipole-dipole interactions. The combination of the dipole-dipole\ninteraction and the precise control over molecular degrees of freedom possible\nat ultracold temperatures make ultracold molecules attractive candidates for\nuse in quantum simulation of condensed matter systems and quantum computation.\nAlso ultracold molecules may provide unique opportunities for studying chemical\ndynamics and for tests of fundamental symmetries.

Gamma, defined to be rho_0^3/2\nr_c^2$, where $\\rho_0$ is the central cluster density, and r_c is the core\nradius, is an accurate representation of the collision rate from the King model\nto within about 25% for all but the least concentrated clusters.

The two galaxies where results of King model fitting have been\nreported in detail show a dearth of core-collapsed clusters relative to that\nseen in the Milky Way, indicating that the core radii of the most concentrated\nclusters are probably slightly overestimated. Recent work has suggested that\nshallower than linear relations exist between proxies for Gamma and the\nprobability that a cluster will contain an X-ray source; we show that there is\na similarly shallow relationship between Gamma and Gamma_h; we also show that\nmeasurement errors are likely to produce a shallower than linear relationship\neven when Gamma itself is used. The evidence is thus consistent with the idea\nthat X-ray binary formation rates are linearly proportional to cluster\ncollision rates. We also find, through comparison with multimass models,\nsuggestive evidence that the retention fractions of neutron stars in globular\nclusters may be related to the present day concentration parameters, which\nwould imply that the most concentrated clusters today were the most\nconcentrated clusters at the time of their supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 19:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This\neffect has important astrophysical and astrometric applications. To achieve a\nbroader understanding of the core shift effect and the physics behind it, we\nconducted a dedicated survey with NRAO's Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We\nused the VLBA to image 20 pre-selected sources simultaneously at nine\nfrequencies in the 1.4-15.4 GHz range. The core position at each frequency was\nmeasured by referencing it to a bright, optically thin feature in the jet. A\nsignificant core shift has been successfully measured in each of the twenty\nsources observed. The median value of the core shift is found to be 1.21 mas if\nmeasured between 1.4 and 15.4 GHz, and 0.24 mas between 5.0 and 15.4 GHz. The\ncore position, r, as a function of frequency, n, is found to be consistent with\nan r n^-1 law. This behavior is predicted by the Blandford & Koenigl model of a\npurely synchrotron self-absorbed conical jet in equipartition.

We construct a consistent\nexample of a Banach space of type $C(K)$ which is 1-separably injective but not\n1-universally separably injective. We show that, under the continuum\nhypothesis, \"to be universally separably injective\" is not a $3$-space\nproperty, as we wrongly claimed in the paper mentioned in the title.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 23:44:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 15:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

It's used for a variety of tasks including simulation of the effect\nof earthquakes on a PBR, calculation of packing fractions, Dancoff factors,\npebble wear and the pebble force on the walls. The simulator includes a new\ndifferential static friction model for the varied geometries of PBRs. A new\nstatic friction benchmark was devised via analytically solving the mechanics\nequations to determine the minimum pebble-to-pebble friction and\npebble-to-surface friction for a five pebble pyramid. This pyramid check as\nwell as a comparison to the Janssen formula was used to test the new static\nfriction equations.\n  Because larger pebble bed simulations involve hundreds of thousands of\npebbles and long periods of time, PEBBLES runs on shared memory architectures\nand distributed memory architectures.

The PEBBLES code\nprovides the ability to determine the contact forces and the lengths of motion\nin contact.

GPI is optimized for high\ncontrast imaging, combining precise and accurate wavefront control, diffraction\nsuppression, and a speckle-suppressing science camera with integral field and\npolarimetry capabilities. The primary science goal for GPI is the direct\ndetection and characterization of young, Jovian-mass exoplanets. For plausible\nassumptions about the distribution of gas giant properties at large semi-major\naxes, GPI will be capable of detecting more than 10% of gas giants more massive\nthan 0.5 M_J around stars younger than 100 Myr and nearer than 75 parsecs. For\nsystems younger than 1 Gyr, gas giants more massive than 8 M_J and with\nsemi-major axes greater than 15 AU are detected with completeness greater than\n50%. A survey targeting young stars in the solar neighborhood will help\ndetermine the formation mechanism of gas giant planets by studying them at ages\nwhere planet brightness depends upon formation mechanism. Such a survey will\nalso be sensitive to planets at semi-major axes comparable to the gas giants in\nour own solar system. In the simple, and idealized, situation in which planets\nformed by either the \"hot-start\" model of Burrows et al. (2003) or the core\naccretion model of Marley et al.

The relative merits of strict versus relaxed memory models\nhave been widely debated in terms of their impact on performance, hardware\ncomplexity and programmability. This paper adds a new dimension to this\ndiscussion: the impact of memory models on software reliability. By allowing\nsome instructions to reorder, weak memory models may expand the window between\ncritical memory operations. This can increase the chance of an undesirable\nthread-interleaving, thus allowing an otherwise-unlikely concurrency bug to\nmanifest. To explore this phenomenon, we define and study a probabilistic model\nof shared-memory parallel programs that takes into account such reordering. We\nuse this model to formally derive bounds on the \\emph{vulnerability} to\nconcurrency bugs of different memory models. Our results show that for 2 (or a\nsmall constant number of) concurrent threads, weaker memory models do indeed\nhave a higher likelihood of allowing bugs. On the other hand, we show that as\nthe number of parallel threads increases, the gap between the different memory\nmodels becomes proportionally insignificant.

We systematically analyze different\nlocality criteria for maximally localized Wannier functions in two- dimensional\nsquare and triangular lattice photonic crystals, employing (local)\nconjugate-gradient as well as (global) genetic-algorithm-based, stochastic\nmethods. Besides the commonly used second moment (SM) locality measure, we\nintroduce a new locality measure, namely the integrated modulus (IM) of the\nWannier function. We show numerically that, in contrast to the SM criterion,\nthe IM criterion leads to an optimization problem with a single extremum, thus\nallowing for fast and efficient construction of maximally localized Wannier\nfunctions using local optimization techniques. We also present an analytical\nformula for the initial choice of Bloch phases, which under certain conditions\nrepresents the global maximum of the IM criterion and, thus, further increases\nthe optimization efficiency in the general case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2011 09:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The velocity of a material body is not an intrinsic property of the\nbody; it depends on a free choice of reference system. Relative velocity is\nthus reference-dependent, it is not an absolute concept. We stress that even\nzero-velocity must be relative. Every reference system possesses its own\nzero-velocity relative only to that particular reference system. Does the\ntheory of relativity formulated in terms of relative velocities, with many\nzero-velocities, imply the Lorentz isometry group? We discuss the many relative\nspaces of Galileo and Poincare, as quotient spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 17:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-06"}
