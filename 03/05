New quadratic recursion and quartic identities are obtained\nfor the form factors for n=2,3. For n= 2,3,4 explicit results are given for the\nform factors. These factorizations are proved for all N for n= 2,3. These\nresults yield the emergence of palindromic polynomials canonically associated\nwith elliptic curves. As a consequence, understanding the form factors amounts\nto describing and understanding an infinite set of palindromic polynomials,\ncanonically associated with elliptic curves. From an analytical viewpoint the\nrelation of these palindromic polynomials with hypergeometric functions\nassociated with elliptic curves is made very explicitly, and from a\ndifferential algebra viewpoint this corresponds to the emergence of direct sums\nof differential operators homomorphic to symmetric powers of a second order\noperator associated with elliptic curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 16:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 17:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In this\npaper we consider a large class of U(1)-invariant nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequations containing complex nonlinearities. The U(1) symmetry implies the\nexistence of a continuity equation for the particle density\n$\\rho\\equiv|\\psi|^2$ where the current ${\\bfm j}_{_\\psi}$ has, in general, a\nnonlinear structure. We introduce a nonlinear gauge transformation on the\ndependent variables $\\rho$ and ${\\bfm j}_{\\psi}$ which changes the evolution\nequation in another one containing only a real nonlinearity and transforms the\nparticle current ${\\bfm j}_{_\\psi}$ in the standard bilinear form. We extend\nthe method to U(1)-invariant coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations where\nthe most general nonlinearity is taken into account through the sum of an\nHermitian matrix and an anti-Hermitian matrix. By means of the nonlinear gauge\ntransformation we change the nonlinear system in another one containing only a\npurely Hermitian nonlinearity. Finally, we consider nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequations minimally coupled with an Abelian gauge field whose dynamics is\ngoverned, in the most general fashion, through the Maxwell-Chern-Simons\nequation. It is shown that the nonlinear transformation we are introducing can\nbe applied, in this case, separately to the gauge field or to the matter field\nwith the same final result. In conclusion, some relevant examples are presented\nto show the applicability of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 16:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-07"}

One way that black hole spin may be estimated is through\nobservations of extended radio sources. These sources, powered by outflows from\nan AGN, allow the beam power and total outflow energy to be studied. In a broad\nclass of models, the beam power of the outflow is related to the spin of the\nblack hole. This relationship is used to estimate black hole spins for 55 radio\nsources. The samples studied include 7 FRII quasars and 19 FRII radio galaxies\nwith redshifts between 0.056 and 1.79, and 29 radio sources associated with CD\ngalaxies with redshifts between 0.0035 and 0.291. The FRII sources studied have\nestimated spin values of between about 0.2 and 1; there is a range of values at\na given redshift, and the values tend to increase with increasing redshift.\nResults obtained for FRII quasars are very similar to those obtained for FRII\ngalaxies. A broader range of spin values are obtained for the sample of radio\nsources associated with CD galaxies studied. The fraction of the spin energy\nextracted per outflow event is estimated and ranges from about 0.03 to 0.5 for\nFRII sources and 0.002 to about 1 for radio sources associated with CD\ngalaxies; the data are consistent with this fraction being independent of\nredshift though the uncertainties are large. The results obtained are\nconsistent with those predicted by numerical simulations that track the merger\nand accretion history of AGN, supporting the idea that, for AGN with powerful\nlarge-scale outflows, beam power is directly related to black hole spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 16:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The required\nhigh xenon purity is usually achieved by continuous recirculation of xenon gas\nthrough a high-temperature getter. This challenges the traditional way of\ncooling these large detectors, since in a thermally well insulated detector,\nmost of the cooling power is spent to compensate losses from recirculation. The\nphase change during recondensing requires five times more cooling power than\ncooling the gas from ambient temperature to -100C (173 K). Thus, to reduce the\ncooling power requirements for large detectors, we propose to use the heat from\nthe purified incoming gas to evaporate the outgoing xenon gas, by means of a\nheat exchanger. Generally, a heat exchanger would appear to be only of very\nlimited use, since evaporation and liquefaction occur at zero temperature\ndifference. However, the use of a recirculation pump reduces the pressure of\nthe extracted liquid, forces it to evaporate, and thus cools it down. We show\nthat this temperature difference can be used for an efficient heat exchange\nprocess. We investigate the use of a commercial parallel plate heat exchanger\nwith a small liquid xenon detector. Although we expected to be limited by the\navailable cooling power to flow rates of about 2 SLPM, rates in excess of 12\nSLPM can easily be sustained, limited only by the pump speed and the impedance\nof the flow loop. The heat exchanger operates with an efficiency of (96.8 +/-\n0.5)%. This opens the possibility for fast xenon gas recirculation in\nlarge-scale experiments, while minimizing thermal losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 21:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-08"}

(2011a) in\norder to: i) investigate the correlation structure of the space defined by an\nextensive set of observables describing gas-rich systems; ii) identify the\nintrinsic parameters that best define their HI content; and iii) explore the\nscaling relations arising from the joint distributions of the quantities most\nstrongly correlated with the HI mass. The principal component analysis\nperformed over a set of five galaxy properties reveals that they are strongly\ninterrelated, supporting previous claims that nearby HI emitters show a high\ndegree of correlation. The best predictors for the expected value of MHI are\nthe diameter of the stellar disk, D25r, followed by the total luminosity (both\nin the r-band), and the maximum rotation speed, while morphological proxies\nsuch as color show only a moderately strong correlation with the gaseous\ncontent attenuated by observational error. The simplest and most accurate\nprescription is log(MHI/Msun)= 8.72 + 1.25*log(D25r/kpc). We find a slope of\n$-8.2 \\pm 0.5$ for the relation between optical magnitude and log rotation\nspeed, in good agreement with Tully-Fisher studies, and a log slope of $1.55\n\\pm 0.06$ for the HI mass-optical galaxy size relation. Given the homogeneity\nof the measurements and the completeness of our dataset, the latter outcome\nsuggests that the constancy of the average (hybrid) HI surface density\nadvocated by some authors for the spiral population is a crude approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 22:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Recently, Avestimehr et al. have proposed a deterministic\nnetwork model to approximate multiuser wireless networks. This model, known as\nthe ADT network model, takes into account the broadcast nature of wireless\nmedium and interference.\n  We show that the ADT network model can be described within the algebraic\nnetwork coding framework introduced by Koetter and Medard. We prove that the\nADT network problem can be captured by a single matrix, and show that the\nmin-cut of an ADT network is the rank of this matrix; thus, eliminating the\nneed to optimize over exponential number of cuts between two nodes to compute\nthe min-cut of an ADT network. We extend the capacity characterization for ADT\nnetworks to a more general set of connections, including single\nunicast/multicast connection and non-multicast connections such as multiple\nmulticast, disjoint multicast, and two-level multicast. We also provide\nsufficiency conditions for achievability in ADT networks for any general\nconnection set. In addition, we show that random linear network coding, a\nrandomized distributed algorithm for network code construction, achieves the\ncapacity for the connections listed above. Furthermore, we extend the ADT\nnetworks to those with random erasures and cycles (thus, allowing\nbi-directional links).\n  In addition, we propose an efficient linear code construction for the\ndeterministic wireless multicast relay network model. Avestimehr et al.'s\nproposed code construction is not guaranteed to be efficient and may\npotentially involve an infinite block length. Unlike several previous coding\nschemes, we do not attempt to find flows in the network. Instead, for a layered\nnetwork, we maintain an invariant where it is required that at each stage of\nthe code construction, certain sets of codewords are linearly independent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2011 02:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 16:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-09"}

In the fully\ndeveloped nonlinear regime, the IGM will evolve into the state of turbulence,\ncontaining strong and curved shocks, vorticity and complex structures.\nTurbulence would lead to the density and velocity fields of the IGM to be\ndifferent from those of underlying collisionless dark matter. Consequently, the\nbaryon fraction f_b will deviate from its cosmic mean . We study these\nphenomena with simulation samples produced by the weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) hybrid cosmological hydrodynamic/N-body code, which is\neffective of capturing shocks and complex structures. We find that the\ndistribution of baryon fraction is highly nonuniform on scales from hundreds\nkpc to a few of Mpc, and f_b varies from as low as 1% to a few times of the\ncosmic mean.

Ultimately behavior is\nviewed as a physical process where flows of energy naturally select ways to\nconsume free energy as soon as possible.
