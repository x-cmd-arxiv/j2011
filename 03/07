First, we evaluate the\ncontribution of statistical fluctuations to the average total vacuum energy,\nwhich is made out of the integration of the variations of the Lamb shift with\nrespect to the coupling constant. While the Lamb shift is a function of the\nelectrical susceptibility only, the vacuum energy is generally not. Second, we\nmake clear why the effective medium bulk energy does not account for the total\nvacuum energy of a molecular dielectric. Consequently, the Lamb shift does not\nderive from the effective medium bulk energy except at leading order in the\nmolecular density. The local field factors provide natural cutoffs for the\nspectrum of the total vacuum energy at a wavelength of the order of the\ncorrelation length. Third, we investigate to what extent shifts in the spectrum\nof the dielectric constant may be attributed to the binding energy of a\ndielectric. In particular, in the continuum approximation we have found a\nrelation between the electrostatic binding energy and the Lorentz-Lorenz shift.\nNonetheless, we conclude that the knowledge of the spectrum of the refractive\nindex is insufficient either to quantify the energy of radiative modes or to\nestimate the electrostatic binding energy of molecular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2011 18:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 16:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

We show that a large\namount of entanglement does not necessarily imply a good boson-like behaviour\nby constructing an explicit counterexample. Moreover, we identify more\nprecisely the role entanglement may play in this situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 07:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

This\ncauses spin fluctuation which leads to the random fluctuation of the Berry\nphase factor acquired by a spin state when the ground state of the system\nevolves in a closed path. The two-point correlation of this phase factor is\nassociated with the probability of the formation of defects. In this framework,\nwe have estimated the density of defects produced in several one dimensional\nspin chains. At the critical region, the entanglement entropy of a block of $L$\nspins with the rest of the system is also estimated which is found to increase\nlogarithmically with $L$. The dependence on the quench time puts a constraint\non the block size $L$.

By measuring the ICL of the\nclusters using multiple techniques, we identify systematic differences in how\neach detection method identifies the ICL. We find that techniques which define\nthe ICL solely based on the current position of the cluster luminosity, such as\na surface brightness or local density threshold, tend to find less ICL than\nmethods utilizing time or velocity information, including stellar particles'\ndensity history or binding energy. The range of ICL fractions (the fraction of\nthe clusters' total luminosity found in the ICL component) we measure at z=0\nacross all our clusters using any definition span the range from 9-36%, and\neven within a single cluster different methods can change the measured ICL\nfraction by up to a factor of two. Separating the cluster's central galaxy from\nthe surrounding ICL component is a challenge for all ICL techniques, and\nbecause the ICL is centrally concentrated within the cluster, the differences\nin the measured ICL quantity between techniques are largely a consequence of\nthis central galaxy/ICL separation. We thoroughly explore the free parameters\ninvolved with each measurement method, and find that adjusting these parameters\ncan change the measured ICL fraction by up to a factor of two. While for all\ndefinitions the quantity of ICL tends to increase with time, the ICL fraction\ndoes not grow at a uniform rate, nor even monotonically under some definitions.\nThus, the ICL can be used as a rough indicator of dynamical age, where more\ndynamically advanced clusters will on average have higher ICL fractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 09:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

An important special case of a spherical conducting\ncavity with a smaller dielectric sphere at its center is treated in more\ndetail. By numerically integrating the equations of motion we demonstrate that\nthe transverse electric oscillations in such cavity can be used to accelerate\nstrongly relativistic electrons. The electron's trajectory is assumed to be\nnearly tangential to the dielectric sphere. We demonstrate that the interaction\nof such electrons with the oscillating magnetic field deflects their trajectory\nfrom a straight line only slightly. The Q factor of such a resonator only\ndepends on losses in the dielectric.

The disc dominated spectra span a\nfactor three in luminosity, and all show that the disc emission is broader than\nthe simplest multicolour disc model. This is consistent with the expected\nrelativistic smearing and changing colour temperature correction produced by\natomic features in the newest disc models. However, these models do not match\nthe data at the 5 per cent level as the predicted atomic features are not\npresent in the data, perhaps indicating that irradiation is important even when\nthe high energy tail is weak.

The Tevatron result is more than a $2\\sigma$ deviation from the\nstandard model prediction and motivates the application of alternative models\nintroducing new states.\n  However, as the standard model predictions for the total cross section\n$\\sigma_{tt}$ and invariant mass distribution $M_{tt}$ for this process are in\ngood agreement with experiments, any alternative model must reproduce these\npredictions. These models can be placed into two categories: One introduces the\ns-channel exchange of new vector bosons with chiral couplings to the light\nquarks and to the top quark and another relies on the t-channel exchange of\nparticles with large flavor-violating couplings in the quark sector. In this\nwork we employ a model which introduces both s- and t-channel nonstandard\ncontributions for the top quark pair production in proton antiproton\ncollisions. We use the minimal version of the $SU(3)_C \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes\nU (1)_X$ model (3-3-1 model) that predicts the existence of a new neutral gauge\nboson, called $Z^\\prime$. This gauge boson has both flavor-changing couplings\nto up and top quarks and chiral coupling to the light quarks and to the top\nquark. This very peculiar model coupling can correct the $A_{FB}$ for top quark\npair production for two ranges of $Z^\\prime$ mass while leading to cross\nsection and invariant mass distribution quite similar to the standard model\nones.

Tests on\nGaussian noise and on a set of simulated signals will be presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 15:33:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 09:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

But does this combination come with an\ninherent cost? We evaluate the cost of concurrency by measuring the amount of\nexpensive synchronization that must be employed in an STM implementation that\nensures positive concurrency, i.e., allows for concurrent transaction\nprocessing in some executions. We focus on two popular progress conditions that\nprovide positive concurrency: progressiveness and permissiveness. We show that\nin permissive STMs, providing a very high degree of concurrency, a transaction\nperforms a linear number of expensive synchronization patterns with respect to\nits read-set size. In contrast, progressive STMs provide a very small degree of\nconcurrency but, as we demonstrate, can be implemented using at most one\nexpensive synchronization pattern per transaction. However, we show that even\nin progressive STMs, a transaction has to \"protect\" (e.g., by using locks or\nstrong synchronization primitives) a linear amount of data with respect to its\nwrite-set size. Our results suggest that looking for high degrees of\nconcurrency in STM implementations may bring a considerable synchronization\ncost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 15:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 15:17:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 14:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 10:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 19 May 2011 13:36:52 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 09:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 11:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 12:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 18:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}
