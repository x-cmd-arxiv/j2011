However, the standard\napproach usually assumes both data and parameter estimates are\nGaussian-distributed. Further, for survey forecasts and optimisation it is\nusually assumed the power-spectra covariance matrix is diagonal in\nFourier-space. But in the low-redshift Universe, non-linear mode-coupling will\ntend to correlate small-scale power, moving information from lower to\nhigher-order moments of the field. This movement of information will change the\npredictions of cosmological parameter accuracy. In this paper we quantify this\nloss of information by comparing naive Gaussian Fisher matrix forecasts with a\nMaximum Likelihood parameter estimation analysis of a suite of mock weak\nlensing catalogues derived from N-body simulations, based on the SUNGLASS\npipeline, for a 2-D and tomographic shear analysis of a Euclid-like survey. In\nboth cases we find that the 68% confidence area of the Omega_m-sigma_8 plane\nincreases by a factor 5. However, the marginal errors increase by just 20 to\n40%. We propose a new method to model the effects of nonlinear shear-power\nmode-coupling in the Fisher Matrix by approximating the shear-power\ndistribution as a multivariate Gaussian with a covariance matrix derived from\nthe mock weak lensing survey. We find that this approximation can reproduce the\n68% confidence regions of the full Maximum Likelihood analysis in the\nOmega_m-sigma_8 plane to high accuracy for both 2-D and tomographic weak\nlensing surveys. Finally, we perform a multi-parameter analysis of Omega_m,\nsigma_8, h, n_s, w_0 and w_a to compare the Gaussian and non-linear\nmode-coupled Fisher matrix contours.

However, we\nsignificantly extend the method to include a different treatment for central\nand satellite galaxies, allowing the stellar mass of satellite galaxies to\ndepend on both the host subhalo mass, and on the halo mass.

We present\nresults for ~10^6 different successful models, showing that the uncertainty in\nthe host subhalo mass reaches a factor of ~10 for a given stellar mass. Our\nresults thus indicate that the host subhalo mass of central and satellite\ngalaxies is poorly constrained by using information coming solely from the\nabundance and CFs of galaxies. In addition, we demonstrate that the fraction of\nstellar mass relative to the universal baryon fraction can vary between\ndifferent models, and can reach ~0.6 for a specific population of low mass\ngalaxies. We conclude that additional observational constraints are needed, in\norder to better constrain the mass relation between haloes and galaxies.

The\ncumulative number of luminous satellites at z = 0 is similar to the observed\nsystem of satellites orbiting the Milky Way although an analysis of the\nsatellite mass function reveals an order of magnitude more dark satellites than\nluminous. Some of the dark subhalos are more massive than some of the luminous\nsubhalos at z = 0. What separates luminous and dark subhalos is not their mass\nat z = 0, but the maximum mass the subhalos ever achieve. We study the effect\nof four mass loss mechanisms on the subhalos: ultraviolet (UV) ionising\nradiation, ram pressure stripping, tidal stripping, and stellar feedback, and\ncompare the impact of each of these four mechanisms on the satellites. In the\nlowest mass subhalos, UV is responsible for the majority of the baryonic mass\nloss. Ram pressure stripping removes whatever mass remains from the low mass\nsatellites. More massive subhalos have deeper potential wells and retain more\nmass during reionisation. However, as satellites pass near the centre of the\nmain halo, tidal forces cause significant mass loss from satellites of all\nmasses. Satellites that are tidally stripped from the outside can account for\nthe luminous satellites that are lower mass than some of the dark satellites.\nStellar feedback has the greatest impact on medium mass satellites that had\nformed stars, but lost all their gas by z = 0.

A cluster-based feedback scheme is proposed such that the\nrange of possible signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the users are divided into\nseveral clusters according to the order statistics of the users' SNRs. Each\ncluster has a corresponding threshold, and the users compare their measured\ninstantaneous SNRs with the thresholds to determine whether and how many bits\nthey should use to feed back their instantaneous SNRs. If a user's\ninstantaneous SNR is lower than a certain threshold, the user does not feed\nback. Feedback load reduction is thus achieved. For a given number of clusters,\nthe sum rate loss using the cluster-based feedback scheme is investigated. Then\nthe minimum number of clusters given a maximum tolerable sum rate loss is\nderived. Through simulations, it is shown that, when the number of users is\nlarge, full multiuser diversity can be achieved by the proposed feedback\nscheme, which is more efficient than the conventional schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 20:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-18"}

This is\ndue in part to the proximity of a hot soft photon bath from the stellar surface\nto putative radiation dissipation regions in the inner magnetosphere. Moreover,\nbecause the scattering process becomes resonant at the cyclotron frequency, the\neffective cross section exceeds the classical Thomson value by over two orders\nof magnitude, thereby enhancing the efficiency of continuum production and the\ncooling of relativistic electrons. This paper presents computations of the\nelectron cooling rates for this process, which are needed for resonant Compton\nmodels of non-thermal radiation from such highly-magnetized pulsars. The\ncomputed rates extend previous calculations of magnetic Thomson cooling to the\ndomain of relativistic quantum effects, sampled near and above the quantum\ncritical magnetic field of 44.13 TeraGauss. This is the first exposition of\nfully relativistic, quantum magnetic Compton cooling rates for electrons, and\nit employs both the traditional Johnson and Lippman cross section, and a newer\nSokolov and Ternov (ST) formulation of Compton scattering in strong magnetic\nfields. Such ST formalism is formally correct for treating spin-dependent\neffects that are important in the cyclotron resonance, and has not been\naddressed before in the context of cooling by Compton scattering. The QED\neffects are observed to profoundly lower the rates below extrapolations of the\nfamiliar magnetic Thomson results, as expected, when recoil and Klein-Nishina\nreductions become important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 08:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Our analysis reveals that the morphological spectral types\nassigned using high-resolution data are systematically later (by up to 1.5\nsubtypes) then those attributed by Walborn.

The starting point of this investigation was\nthe detection at the IRAM-30m telescope of molecular gas with very large line\nsplittings up to 260km/s within the beam (40 pc). In this region, which is\nknown for its low gas content, we also detect an ionised gas outflow in the\ncircumnuclear region (within 75pc from the centre) extending to the whole area\nin X-ray. Relying on atomic, ionised, and molecular gas, we account for most\nobservables with a scenario that assumes that a few hundreds Myr ago, M31\nunderwent a frontal collision with M32, which triggered some star-formation\nactivity in the centre, and this collision explains the special configuration\nof M31 with two rings observed at 0.7kpc and 10kpc. The inner disc (whose\nrotation is detected in HI and ionised gas ([NII])) has thus been tilted\n(inclination: 43deg, PA: 70deg) with respect to the main disc (inclination:\n77deg, PA: 35deg). One of the CO velocity components is compatible with this\ninner disc, while the second one comes from a tilted ring-like material with\n40deg inclination and PA=-35deg. The relic star formation estimated by previous\nworks to have occurred more than 100Myr ago could have been triggered by the\ncollision and could be linked to the outflow detected in the ionised gas. Last,\nwe demonstrate that the amplitude of the line splittings detected in CO centred\non the systemic velocity with a relatively high spatial resolution (40pc)\ncannot be accounted for by a possible weak bar that is roughly aligned along\nthe minor axis. Although M31 has a triaxial bulge, there are no bar indicators\nin the gas component (photometry, no strong skewness of the isovelocities,\netc.).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 12:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 11:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

A distance of $\\sim$2.1 kpc and a mean age of $\\sim$1.3 Myr have\nbeen obtained for the central cluster. The young stellar objects (YSOs)\nassociated with the region are identified on the basis of near-infrared and\nmid-infrared observations. We confirmed our earlier results that the average\nage of the YSOs lying on/inside the rim are younger than those lying outside\nthe rim. The global distribution of the YSOs shows an aligned distribution from\nthe ionising source to the BRCs. These facts indicate that a series of\nradiation driven implosion processes proceeded from near the central ionising\nsource towards the periphery of the W5 E H{\\sc ii} region.

Dynamical masses obtained under the assumption that mass\nfollows light do not match with the masses of strong gravitational lens systems\nof similar velocity dispersions. Instead, dynamical fits with dark matter halos\nare in good agreement with lensing results. We derive mass-to-light ratios of\nthe stellar populations from Lick absorption line indices, reproducing well the\nobserved galaxy colours. Even in dynamical models with dark matter halos the\namount of mass that follows the light increases more rapidly with galaxy\nvelocity dispersion than expected for a constant stellar initial mass function\n(IMF). While galaxies around sigma ~ 200 km/s are consistent with a Kroupa IMF,\nthe same IMF underpredicts luminous dynamical masses of galaxies with sigma ~\n300 km/s by a factor of two and more. A systematic variation of the stellar IMF\nwith galaxy velocity dispersion could explain this trend with a Salpeter IMF\nfor the most massive galaxies. If the IMF is instead constant, then some of the\ndark matter in high velocity dispersion galaxies must follow a spatial\ndistribution very similar to that of the light. A combination of both, a\nvarying IMF and a component of dark matter that follows the light is possible\nas well. For a subsample of galaxies with old stellar populations we show that\nthe tilt in the fundamental plane can be explained by systematic variations of\nthe total (stellar + dark) mass inside the effective radius.

We have proposed to use the\nrotated complex wavelet filters (RCWF) and dual tree complex wavelet\ntransform(DTCWT) together to derive signature feature extraction, which\ncaptures information in twelve different directions. In identification phase,\nCanberra distance measure is used. The proposed method is compared with\ndiscrete wavelet transform (DWT). From experimental results it is found that\nsignature identification rate of proposed method is superior over DWT\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 15:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-18"}

We compare models for which the Hubble scale, the future event horizon or\na quantity proportional to the Ricci scale are taken as the infrared cutoff\nlength. We demonstrate that the mere definition of the holographic dark-energy\ndensity generally implies an interaction with the dark-matter component. We\ndiscuss the relation between the equation-of-state parameter and the energy\ndensity ratio of both components for each of the choices, as well as the\npossibility of non-interacting and scaling solutions. Parameter estimations for\nall three cutoff options are performed with the help of a Bayesian statistical\nanalysis, using data from supernovae type Ia and the history of the Hubble\nparameter. The $\\Lambda$CDM model is the clear winner of the analysis.\nAccording to the Bayesian Information Criterion ($BIC$), all holographic models\nshould be considered as ruled out, since the difference $\\Delta BIC$ to the\ncorresponding $\\Lambda$CDM value is $> 10$. According to the Akaike Information\nCriterion ($AIC$), however, we find $\\Delta AIC$ $< 2$ for models with\nHubble-scale and Ricci-scale cutoffs, indicating, that they may still be\ncompetitive. As we show for the example of the Ricci-scale case, also the use\nof certain priors, reducing the number of free parameters to that of the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, may result in a competitive holographic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 15:55:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 00:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
