In the first work I present, I study a\nscalar-tensor theory of gravity and I address the renormalization of the\nenergy-momentum tensor for point-like and string-like sources. The second and\nthird study I report are set in the context of testing gravity. So far\nexperiments have probed dynamical regimes only up to order (v/c)^5 in the\npost-Newtonian expansion, which corresponds to the very first term of the\nradiative sector in General Relativity. In contrast, by means of\ngravitational-wave astronomy, one aims at testing General Relativity up to\n(v/c)^(12)! It is then relevant to envisage testing frameworks which are\nappropriate to this strong-field/radiative regime. In the last two chapters of\nthis thesis a new such framework is presented. Using the effective field theory\napproach, General Relativity non-linearities are described by Feynman diagrams\nin which classical gravitons interact with matter sources and among themselves.\nTagging the self-interaction vertices of gravitons with parameters it is\npossible, for example, to translate the measure of the period decay of\nHulse-Taylor pulsar in a constraint on the three-graviton vertex at the 0.1%\nlevel; for comparison, LEP constraints on the triple-gauge-boson couplings of\nweak interactions are accurate at 3%. With future observations of gravitational\nwaves, higher order graviton vertices can in principle be constrained through a\nFisher matrix analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2011 20:34:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 16:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

When an event horizon is absent, an\ninitially infalling particle turns back as an outgoing particle, when it has\nthe angular momentum in an appropriate range of values, which then collides\nwith infalling particles. When the collision takes place close to what would\nhave been the event horizon in the extremal case, the center of mass energy of\ncollision is arbitrarily large, depending on how close is the overspinning Kerr\ngeometry to the extremal case. Thus the fast rotating Kerr configurations if\nthey exist in nature could provide an excellent cosmic laboratory to probe\nultra-high-energy physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2011 20:41:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 11:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-17"}

The framework is\nguided by the AdS/CFT correspondence incorporating a gravitational background\nasymptotic to AdS space which encodes the salient properties of QCD, such as\nthe ultraviolet conformal limit at the AdS boundary at $z \\to 0$, as well as\nmodifications of the geometry in the large $z$ infrared region to describe\nconfinement and linear Regge behavior. There are two equivalent procedures for\nderiving the AdS/QCD equations of motion: one can start from the Hamiltonian\nequation of motion in physical space time by studying the off-shell dynamics of\nthe bound state wavefunctions as a function of the invariant mass of the\nconstituents. To a first semiclassical approximation, where quantum loops and\nquark masses are not included, this leads to a light-front Hamiltonian equation\nwhich describes the bound state dynamics of light hadrons in terms of an\ninvariant impact variable $\\zeta$ which measures the separation of the partons\nwithin the hadron at equal light-front time. Alternatively, one can start from\nthe gravity side by studying the propagation of hadronic modes in a fixed\neffective gravitational background. Both approaches are equivalent in the\nsemiclassical approximation. This allows us to identify the holographic\nvariable $z$ in AdS space with the impact variable $\\zeta$. Light-front\nholography thus allows a precise mapping of transition amplitudes from AdS to\nphysical space-time.

One of the leading strategies to reduce decoherence is\ndynamical decoupling --- the use of an external field to average out the effect\nof the environment. The decoherence rate under any control field can be\ncalculated if the spectrum of the coupling to the environment is known. We\npresent a direct measurement of the bath coupling spectrum in an ensemble of\noptically trapped ultracold atoms, by applying a spectrally narrow-band control\nfield. The measured spectrum follows a Lorentzian shape at low frequencies, but\nexhibits non-monotonic features at higher frequencies due to the oscillatory\nmotion of the atoms in the trap. These features agree with our analytical\nmodels and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations of the collisional bath. From the\ninferred bath-coupling spectrum, we predict the performance of well-known\ndynamical decoupling sequences: CPMG, UDD and CDD. We then apply these\nsequences in experiment and compare the results to predictions, finding good\nagreement in the weak-coupling limit. Thus, our work establishes experimentally\nthe validity of the overlap integral formalism, and is an important step\ntowards the implementation of an optimal dynamical decoupling sequence for a\ngiven measured bath spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2011 06:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}

In this study, we\nmodel fluid flow in an evolvable real rock joint structure, which under certain\nnormal load is sheared. In an experimental study, information regarding about\napertures of the rock joint during consecutive 20 mm displacements and fluid\nflow (permeability) in different pressure heads have been recorded by a scanner\nlaser. Our aim in this study is to simulate the fluid flow in the mentioned\ncomplex geometries using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), while the\ncharacteristics of the aperture field will be compared with the modeled fluid\nflow permeability To characterize the aperture, we use a new concept in the\ngraph theory, namely: complex networks and motif analysis of the corresponding\nnetworks. In this approach, the similar aperture profile along the fluid flow\ndirection is mapped in to a network space. The modeled permeability using the\nLBM shows good correlation with the experimental measured values. Furthermore,\nthe two main characters of the obtained networks, i.e., characteristic length\nand number of edges show the same evolutionary trend with the modeled\npermeability values. Analysis of motifs through the obtained networks showed\nthe most transient sub-graphs are much more frequent in residual stages. This\ncoincides with nearly stable fluid flow and high permeability values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2011 13:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-08"}

In\nthe context of the Chandra Carina Complex Project, we study Trumpler 16 using\nnew and archival X-ray data. A revised X-ray source list of the Trumpler 16\nregion contains 1232 X-ray sources including 1187 likely Carina members. These\nare matched to 1047 near-infrared counterparts detected by the HAWK-I\ninstrument at the VLT allowing for better selection of cluster members. The\ncluster is irregular in shape. Although it is roughly circular, there is a high\ndegree of sub-clustering, no noticeable central concentration and an extension\nto the southeast. The high--mass stars show neither evidence of mass\nsegregation nor evidence of strong differential extinction. The derived\npower-law slope of the X-ray luminosity function for Trumpler 16 reveals a much\nsteeper function than the Orion Nebula Cluster implying different ratio of\nsolar- to higher-mass stars. We estimate the total Trumpler 16 pre-main\nsequence population to be > 6500 Class II and Class III X-ray sources. An\noverall K-excess disk frequency of ~ 8.9% is derived using the X-ray selected\nsample, although there is some variation among the sub-clusters, especially in\nthe Southeastern extension.
