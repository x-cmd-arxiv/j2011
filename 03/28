The sensitivity of the obtained charged-hadron P_T\nspectrum on the hydrodynamic model parameters is studied. For the high-P_T\npart, we apply a number of parton-medium interaction models, which are tuned to\ndescribe the nuclear suppression factor R_AA measured at the RHIC in central\nAu-Au collisions at sqrt{s}=200 GeV. We find that the higher kinematic reach of\nthe LHC, manifest in the hardening of the pQCD parton spectral slope, is in\nprinciple very efficient in discriminating the various models.

We used the thermo-chemical disk code\nProDiMo and the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST to model the\nprotoplanetary disk around ET Cha.

Our results can be applied for cloning of an arbitrary\nmirror-symmetric distribution of qubits on Bloch sphere including in special\ncases the universal cloning and phase-covariant cloning. We show that the\ncloning is optimal by adapting our former optimality proof for axisymmetric\ncloning [Phys. Rev. 82, 042330 (2010)]. Moreover, we propose an optical\nrealization of the optimal mirror phase-covariant 1 to 2 cloning of a qubit,\nfor which the mean probability of successful cloning varies from 1/6 to 1/3\ndepending on prior information on the set of qubits to be cloned. The qubits\nare represented by polarization states of photons generated by the type-I\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion. The scheme is based on the interference\nof two photons on an unbalanced polarization-dependent beam splitter with\ndifferent splitting ratios for vertical and horizontal polarization components\nand the additional application of feedforward by means of Pockels cells.

To fill up this gap, we carried out a complete\nspectral survey of the bands at 3, 2, 1 and 0.8 mm towards the solar type\nprotostar IRAS16293-2422. The observations covered about 200\\,GHz and were\nobtained with the IRAM-30m and JCMT-15m telescopes. Particular attention was\ndevoted to the inter-calibration of the obtained spectra with previous\nobservations. All the lines detected with more than 3 sigma and free from\nobvious blending effects were fitted with Gaussians to estimate their basic\nkinematic properties. More than 4000 lines were detected (with sigma \\geq 3)\nand identified, yielding a line density of approximatively 20 lines per GHz,\ncomparable to previous surveys in massive hot cores. The vast majority (~2/3)\nof the lines are weak and due to complex organic molecules. The analysis of the\nprofiles of more than 1000 lines belonging 70 species firmly establishes the\npresence of two distinct velocity components, associated with the two objects,\nA and B, forming the IRAS16293-2422 binary system. In the source A, the line\nwidths of several species increase with the upper level energy of the\ntransition, a behavior compatible with gas infalling towards a ~1 Mo object.\nThe source B, which does not show this effect, might have a much lower central\nmass of ~0.1 Mo. The difference in the rest velocities of both objects is\nconsistent with the hypothesis that the source B rotates around the source A.\nThis spectral survey, although obtained with single-dish telescope with a low\nspatial resolution, allows to separate the emission from 2 different\ncomponents, thanks to the large number of lines detected.

The galaxy\nformation model involves a sharp entropy barrier against the accretion of gas\nonto low-mass halos, the shock heating of infalling gas far from the central\nregions of massive halos, and supernova feedback that drives the gas out of\nshallow halo potential wells. With the first approach, we show that the large\nmajority of galaxies within group- and cluster-mass halos, known to be mainly\ndwarf ellipticals, have acquired the bulk of their stellar mass through gas\naccretion and not via galaxy mergers. With the second approach, we\nqualitatively reproduce the downsizing trend of greater ages at greater masses\nin stars and predict an upsizing trend of greater ages as one proceeds to\nmasses lower than 10^10 M_Sun. We find that the fraction of galaxies with very\nyoung stellar populations (more than half the stellar mass formed within the\nlast 1.5 Gyr) is a function of present-day stellar mass, which peaks at 0.5% at\nm_crit=10^7.5-9.5 M_Sun, roughly corresponding to the masses of blue compact\ndwarfs.

Is it true also for lighter systems,\nsuch as galaxy groups? The answer is globally yes, although with remarkable\ndifferences.

After shock\nheating, a phase of turbulence promotes gas mixing and diffusion of metals,\nwhich peak along jet-axis (up to 40 kpc) during active phases. At this stage\nthe tunnel, produced by the enduring outflow (hard to detect in the mock SBx\nmaps), is easily fragmented, producing tiny buoyant bubbles, typically a few\nkpc in size. In contrast to galaxy clusters, the AGN self-regulated feedback\nhas to be persistent, with a `delicate touch', rather than rare and explosive\nstrokes.

In a first step we use mean-field\ntheory with two order parameters. The first order parameter is a complex\npairing amplitude between conduction electrons and localized spins which\ndescribes condensation of Kondo (or Zhang-Rice) singlets. A nonvanishing value\nimplies that the localized spins contribute to the Fermi surface volume. The\nsecond order parameter describes singlet-pairing between the localized spins\nand competes with the Kondo-pairing order parameter. Reduction of the carrier\ndensity in the conduction band reduces the energy gain due to the formation of\nthe large Fermi surface and induces a phase transition to a state with strong\nsinglet correlations between the localized spins and a Fermi surface which\ncomprises only the conduction electrons. The model thus shows a doping-driven\nchange of its Fermi surface volume. At intermediate doping and low temperature\nthere is a phase where both order parameters coexist, which has a gapped large\nFermi surface and d-wave superconductivity. The theory thus qualitatively\nreproduces the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors.

Alas, the nanoflare\ndensity and brightness implied by this hypothesis means that conclusive\nverification is beyond present observational abilities. Nevertheless, we\ninvestigate the plausibility of the nanoflare hypothesis by constructing a\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model that can derive the energy of a nanoflare from\nthe nature of an ideal kink instability. The set of energy-releasing\ninstabilities is captured by an instability threshold for linear kink modes.\nEach point on the threshold is associated with a unique energy release and so\nwe can predict a distribution of nanoflare energies. When the linear\ninstability threshold is crossed, the instability enters a nonlinear phase as\nit is driven by current sheet reconnection. As the ensuing flare erupts and\ndeclines, the field transitions to a lower energy state, which is modelled by\nrelaxation theory, i.e., helicity is conserved and the ratio of current to\nfield becomes invariant within the loop. We apply the model so that all the\nloops within an ensemble achieve instability followed by energy-releasing\nrelaxation. The result is a nanoflare energy distribution. Furthermore, we\nproduce different distributions by varying the loop aspect ratio, the nature of\nthe path to instability taken by each loop and also the level of radial\nexpansion that may accompany loop relaxation. The heating rate obtained is just\nsufficient for coronal heating. In addition, we also show that kink instability\ncannot be associated with a critical magnetic twist value for every point along\nthe instability threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 14:38:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 10:50:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 10:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In this paper, we consider the class of hierarchical\nloglinear models for discrete data given under the form of a contingency table\nwith multinomial sampling. We assume that the Diaconis-Ylvisaker conjugate\nprior is the prior distribution on the loglinear parameters and the uniform is\nthe prior distribution on the space of models.

Based on the analysis of this relief, different\nmechanisms of diffusion and drift of the graphene flake on the graphite surface\nare considered. A new mechanism of diffusion and drift of the flake is\nproposed. According to the proposed mechanism, rotational transition of the\nflake from commensurate to incommensurate state takes place with subsequent\nsimultaneous rotation and translational motion until a commensurate state is\nreached again, and so on. Analytic expressions for the diffusion coefficient\nand mobility of the flake corresponding to different mechanisms are derived in\nwide ranges of temperatures and sizes of the flake.

The methods of control over the diffusion and\ndrift of graphene components in nanoelectromechanical systems are discussed.\nThe possibility to experimentally determine the barriers to relative motion of\ngraphene layers based on the study of diffusion of a graphene flake is\nconsidered.

The cross sections for capture to the\nground state and to the 5181, 6172, and 6792 keV excited states in O-15 have\nbeen determined at 359, 380, and 399 keV beam energy. In addition, the\nbranching ratios for the decay of the 278 keV resonance have been remeasured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 15:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

In this contribution, I\nreview the fundamental physical processes that underlie the generation and\ntransfer of polarized radiation in stellar atmospheres, and I discuss the\npresent status of the theoretical schemes now available, pointing out their\nmain successes and limitations. I also present some ideas about the theoretical\nimprovements that I consider necessary to achieve a correct interpretation of\nthe complex phenomenology shown by polarimetric observations, focusing\nparticularly on the second solar spectrum, which can be considered as one of\nthe most important test benches of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 15:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-29"}

The BP suggests that Casimir edge\neffects are anomalously small, supporting results obtained earlier in special\ncases.

We computed the skeleton length of\nsimulated effective convergence maps covering $\\sim 35$ sq. deg each, extracted\nfrom a suite of cosmological $n-$body runs with different levels of local\nprimordial non-Gaussianity. The latter is expected to alter the structure\nformation process with respect to the fiducial Gaussian scenario, and thus to\nleave a signature on the cosmic web. We found that alterations of the initial\nconditions consistently modify both the cumulative and the differential\nskeleton length, although the effect is generically smaller than the cosmic\nvariance and depends on the smoothing of the map prior to the skeleton\ncomputation. Nevertheless, the qualitative shape of these deviations is rather\nsimilar to their primordial counterparts, implying that skeleton statistics\nretain good memory of the initial conditions. We performed a statistical\nanalysis in order to find out at what Confidence Level primordial\nnon-Gaussianity could be constrained by the skeleton test on cosmic shear maps\nof the size we adopted. At 68.3% Confidence Level we found an error on the\nmeasured level of primordial non-Gaussianity of $\\Delta f_\\mathrm{NL}\\sim 300$,\nwhile at 90% Confidence Level it is of $\\Delta f_\\mathrm{NL}\\sim 500$. While\nthese values by themselves are not competitive with the current constraints,\nweak lensing maps larger than those used here would have a smaller\nfield-to-field variance, and thus would likely lead to tighter constraints. A\nrough estimate indicates $\\Delta f_\\mathrm{NL} \\sim$ a few tens at 68.3%\nConfidence Level for an all-sky weak lensing survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 15:48:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 18:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
