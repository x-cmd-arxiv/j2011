Based on these\ndata and some semi-analytical calculations our principal results may be\nsummarized as follows. For type A potentials: (i) The average frequency has a\npower law dependence on the pressure;(ii) The normalized vibrational density of\nstates (NVDOS), with the average frequency as the unit of frequency, will\nsaturate as the pressure keeps increasing. This asymptotic NVDOS is independent\nof the attractive component of the potential and hence define a universality\nclass; and (iii) At higher pressures the Debye frequency and the average\nfrequency have the same pressure dependence and this dependence is identical\nfor the amorphous form and the two crystalline forms studied (FCC and HCP). For\ntype B potentials, the above phenomenology will hold good to a good\napproximation over a wide range of intermediate pressures.

Despite\nthe large amount of data available on these prominent features and related\nphenomena, many questions remained unanswered as to their generation and\nrelative contributions to the high-speed streams emanating from CHs.

Spherical tokamaks (STs) operate generally in high-beta\nregimes, in which the usual EC O- and X- modes are cut-off. In this case, EBWs\nseem to be the only option that can provide features similar to the EC\nwaves---controllable localized H&CD that can be utilized for core plasma\nheating as well as for accurate plasma stabilization. The EBW is a\nquasi-electrostatic wave that can be excited by mode conversion from a suitably\nlaunched O- or X-mode; its propagation further inside the plasma is strongly\ninfluenced by the plasma parameters. These rather awkward properties make its\napplication somewhat more difficult. In this paper we perform an extensive\nnumerical study of EBW H&CD performance in four typical ST plasmas (NSTX L- and\nH-mode, MAST Upgrade, NHTX). Coupled ray-tracing (AMR) and Fokker-Planck (LUKE)\ncodes are employed to simulate EBWs of varying frequencies and launch\nconditions, which are the fundamental EBW parameters that can be chosen and\ncontrolled. Our results indicate that an efficient and universal EBW H&CD\nsystem is indeed viable. In particular, power can be deposited and current\nreasonably efficiently driven across the whole plasma radius. Such a system\ncould be controlled by a suitably chosen launching antenna vertical position\nand would also be sufficiently robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 10:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 14:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-10"}

There are two notions of discrepancy, namely continuous\ndiscrepancy and combinatorial discrepancy. Depending on the ranges, several\npossible variants arise, for example star discrepancy, box discrepancy, and\ndiscrepancy of half-spaces. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of these\nproblems with respect to the dimension d of the underlying space.\n  All these problems are solvable in time {n^O(d)}, but such a time dependency\nquickly becomes intractable for high-dimensional data. Thus it is interesting\nto ask whether the dependency on d can be moderated.\n  We answer this question negatively by proving that the canonical decision\nproblems are W[1]-hard with respect to the dimension. This is done via a\nparameterized reduction from the Clique problem. As the parameter stays linear\nin the input parameter, the results moreover imply that these problems require\n{n^\\Omega(d)} time, unless 3-Sat can be solved in {2^o(n)} time.\n  Further, we derive that testing whether a given set is an {\\epsilon}-net with\nrespect to half-spaces takes {n^\\Omega(d)} time under the same assumption.

On the other hand,\nstructured lattices can create structured interference as opposed to the random\ninterference caused by random Gaussian symbols. The structured interference\nspace can be exploited to transmit the desired signals over the gaps. However,\nthe existing alignment methods on the lattice codes for quasi-static channels\neither require infinite SNR or symmetric interference channel coefficients.\nFurthermore, perfect channel state information (CSI) is required for these\nalignment methods, which is difficult to achieve in practice.

No evidence is found of a border\nseparating monoclinic (M) from rhombohedral (R) phases, in agreement with\nrecent structural studies supporting a coexistence of the two phases over a\nbroad composition range x < 0.5, with the fraction of M increasing toward the\nMPB. It is also discussed why the observed maximum of elastic compliance\nappears to be due to a rotational instability of the polarisation and therefore\ncannot be explained by extrinsic softening from finely twinned R phase alone,\nbut indicates the presence also of M phase, not necessarily homogeneous.\n  A new diffuse transition is found within the ferroelectric phase near x ~\n0.1, at a temperature T_IT higher than the well established boundary T_T to the\nphase with tilted octahedra. It is proposed that around T_IT the octahedra\nstart rotating in a disordered manner and finally become ordered below T_T. In\nthis interpretation, the onset temperature for octahedral tilting monotonically\nincreases up to the antiferroelectric transition of PbZrO3, and the depression\nof T_T(x) below x = 0.18 would be a consequence of the partial relieve of the\nmismatch between the cation radii with the initial stage of tilting below T_IT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 14:32:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 11:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Since the interactions between system and environment are\nlocal, they can also cause a loss of spatial coherence: correlations between\nspatially distant parts of the system are lost and the equilibrium states can\nbecome localized. This effect limits the distance over which quantum\ninformation can be transmitted, e.g., along a spin chain. We investigate this\nissue in a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator, where it is possible\nto monitor the spreading of quantum information in a three-dimensional network:\nstates that are initially localized on individual spins (qubits) spread under\nthe influence of a suitable Hamiltonian apparently without limits. If we add a\nperturbation to this Hamiltonian, the spreading stops and the system reaches a\nlimiting size, which becomes smaller as the strength of the perturbation\nincreases.

This renders the resource allocation problem prohibitively\ndifficult and the standard optimization tools (e.g., Lagrange dual approach\nwidely used for OFDMA, etc.) can not help towards its optimal solution. We\npropose a novel optimization framework for the solution of these problems that\nis inspired from the recently developed canonical duality theory. We first\nformulate the optimization problems as binary-integer programming problems and\nthen transform these binary-integer programming problems into continuous space\ncanonical dual problems that are concave maximization problems. Based on the\nsolution of the continuous space dual problems, we derive resource allocation\n(joint with adaptive modulation for JAMSCmin) algorithms for both the problems\nwhich have polynomial complexities. We provide conditions under which the\nproposed algorithms are optimal. We also propose an adaptive modulation scheme\nfor SUmax problem. We compare the proposed algorithms with the existing\nalgorithms in the literature to assess their performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 15:15:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 16:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 17:41:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 05:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We argue\nthat gauge bosons with very small couplings to ordinary fermions in this mass\nrange are natural in string compactifications and are likely to be generic in\ntheories for which the gravity scale is systematically smaller than the Planck\nmass - such as in extra-dimensional models - because of the necessity to\nsuppress proton decay.

In particular, if the new gauge charge appears to be anomalous,\nanomaly cancellation does not also require the introduction of new light\nfermions in the low-energy theory. Furthermore, the charge can appear to be\nconserved in the low-energy theory, despite the corresponding gauge boson\nhaving a mass.
