All the features that characterize the\nspin-glass (SG) behavior are found: bifurcation of the dc susceptibility chi vs\ntemperature curve, a peak in the zero-field cooling branch of this curve\naccompanied by a step in the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility chi_ac,\nfrequency dependence of the peak position in the real part of chi_ac and\nscaling behavior. The decay of remnant magnetization is described by a\nstretched-exponential function. The characteristic time from the critical\nslowing-down formula that governs the dynamics of the system suggests the\nexistence of the spin clusters. The strongest interactions between the\nfluctuating entities are at y equal to the charge carriers concentration in the\nsystem. The SG transition temperature decreases linearly with decreasing y for\ny<0.30 and extrapolates to 0 K at y=0 what means that Ni display a magnetic\ncharacter in the surrounding Cu-O network starting from the smallest\nconcentration y. The static critical exponents characterizing the scaling\nbehavior of the nonlinear part of chi lie between those typical for three\ndimensional Ising-like and Heisenberg-like systems\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 16:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-11"}

To further understand the processes involved in the formation of\nmassive stars, we have undertaken a study of the gas dynamics surrounding three\nmassive star forming regions. By observing the large scale structures at high\nresolution, we are able to determine properties such as driving source, and\nspatially resolve the bulk dynamical properties of the gas such as infall and\noutflow. Aims. With high resolution observations, we are able to determine\nwhich of the cores in a cluster forming massive stars is responsible for the\nlarge scale structures. Methods. We present CO observations of three massive\nstar forming regions with known HII regions and show how the CO traces both\ninfall and outflow. By combining data taken in two SMA configurations with JCMT\nobservations, we are able to see large scale structures at high resolution.\nResults. We find large (0.26-0.40 pc), massive (2-3 M_sun) and energetic (13-17\n\\times 10^44 erg) outflows emanating from the edges of two HII regions\nsuggesting they are being powered by the protostar(s) within. We find infall\nsignatures in two of our sources with mass infall rates of order 10-4 M_sun/yr.\nConclusions. We suggest that star formation is ongoing in these sources despite\nthe presence of HII regions. We further conclude that the source(s) within a\nsingle HII region are responsible for the observed large scale structures; that\nthese large structures are not the net effect of multiple outflows from\nmultiple HII regions and hot cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 16:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Our most successful model assumes different distributions of break\nfrequencies, nu_M, for BL Lacs and Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). The\nformer objects have substantially higher values of nu_M, implying that the\nsynchrotron emission comes from more compact regions; therefore, a substantial\nincrease of the BL Lac fraction at high radio frequencies and at bright flux\ndensities is predicted.

We formulate a\nsystematic theoretical framework of entropy-based statistical mechanics for\nspherically symmetric collisionless self-gravitating systems. We use an\napproach that is very different from that of the conventional statistical\nmechanics of short-range interaction systems. We demonstrate that the\nequilibrium states of self-gravitating systems consist of both mechanical and\nstatistical equilibria, with the former characterized by a series of\nvelocity-moment equations and the latter by statistical equilibrium equations,\nwhich should be derived from the entropy principle. The velocity-moment\nequations of all orders are derived from the steady-state collisionless\nBoltzmann equation. We point out that the ergodicity is invalid for the whole\nself-gravitating systems, but it can be re-established locally. Based on the\nlocal ergodicity, using Fermi-Dirac-like statistics, with the nondegenerate\ncondition and the spatial independence of the local microstates, we rederive\nthe Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. This is consistent with the validity of the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation, and should be the correct entropy form for\ncollisionless self-gravitating systems. Apart from the usual constraints of\nmass and energy conservation, we demonstrate that the series of moment or\nvirialization equations must be included as additional constraints on the\nentropy functional when performing the variational calculus; this is an\nextension to the original prescription by White & Narayan. Any possible\nvelocity distribution can be produced by the statistical-mechanical approach\nthat we have developed with the extended Boltzmann-Gibbs/White-Narayan\nstatistics.

We want to understand the chemistry and physics of disks on the basis\nof a large unbiased and statistically relevant grid of disk models.

We\nexplore the results of the DENT grid (Disk Evolution with Neat Theory) that\nconsists of 300 000 disk models with 11 free parameters. Through a statistical\nanalysis, we search for correlations and trends in an effort to find tools for\ndisk diagnostic. Results. All calculated quantities like species masses,\ntemperatures, continuum and line fluxes differ by several orders of magnitude\nacross the entire parameter space. The broad distribution of these quantities\nas a function of input parameters shows the limitation of using a prototype T\nTauri or Herbig Ae/Be disk model. The statistical analysis of the DENT grid\nshows that CO gas is rarely the dominant carbon reservoir in disks. Models with\nlarge inner radii (10 times the dust condensation radius) and/or shallow\nsurface density gradients lack massive gas phase water reservoirs.

One of these quantities is the apparent\nradius of each neutron star as inferred from the X-ray flux and spectral\ntemperature measured during the cooling tails of bursts, when the thermonuclear\nflash is believed to have engulfed the entire star. In this paper, we analyze\n13,095 X-ray spectra of 446 X-ray bursts observed from 12 sources in order to\nassess possible systematic effects in the measurements of the apparent radii of\nneutron stars. We first show that the vast majority of the observed X-ray\nspectra are consistent with blackbody functions to within a few percent. We\nfind that most X-ray bursts follow a very well determined correlation between\nX-ray flux and temperature, which is consistent with the whole neutron-star\nsurface emitting uniformly during the cooling tails. We develop a Bayesian\nGaussian mixture algorithm to measure the apparent radii of the neutron stars\nin these sources, while detecting and excluding a small number of X-ray bursts\nthat show irregular cooling behavior. This algorithm also provides us with a\nquantitative measure of the systematic uncertainties in the measurements.

We observe a very young cluster\npopulation with 70% of the systems formed less than 10 Myr ago. The peak in the\nstar cluster age distribution at 4 Myr is corroborated by the presence of\nWolf-Rayet spectral features, and by the observed optical and IR lines ratios\n[OIII]/H_beta and [NeIII]/[NeII]. The recovered extinction in these very young\nclusters shows large variations, with a decrease at older ages. It is likely\nthat our analysis is limited to the optically brightest objects (i.e. systems\nonly partially embedded in their natal cocoons). We map the extinction across\nthe galaxy using low-resolution spectra and the H_alpha/H_beta ratio, as\nobtained from ground-based narrow band imaging.

The technique relies on two properties of the\nexpected signal from annihilations of the smooth dark matter component in our\ngalaxy: 1) it is approximately rotationally symmetric around the axis\nconnecting us to the Galactic Center, and 2) variations from the mean signal\nare uncorrelated from one pixel to the next. We apply this technique to recent\ndata from the Fermi telescope to generate constraints on the dark matter mass\nand cross section for a variety of annihilation channels. We quantify the\nuncertainty introduced into our constraints by uncertainties in the halo\nprofile and by the possibility that the halo is triaxial. The resultant\nconstraint, the flux F \\leq 4.5\\times10^-6 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 for energies\nbetween 1 and 100 GeV at an angle 15 degrees away from the Galactic Center,\ntranslates into an upper limit on the velocity weighted annihilation cross\nsection of order 10^-25 cm^3 s^-1 depending on the annihilation mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 21:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 17:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}

However, the simulation of realistically sized devices under the\nNEGF formalism typically requires prohibitive amounts of memory and computation\ntime. Two of the most demanding computational problems for NEGF simulation\ninvolve mathematical operations with structured matrices called semiseparable\nmatrices. In this work, we present parallel approaches for these computational\nproblems which allow for efficient distribution of both memory and computation\nbased upon the underlying device structure. This is critical when simulating\nrealistically sized devices due to the aforementioned computational burdens.\nFirst, we consider determining a distributed compact representation for the\nretarded Green's function matrix $G^{R}$.

The second parallel operation allows for the\ncomputation of electron density and current characteristics for the device.\nSpecifically, matrix products between the distributed representation for the\nsemiseparable matrix $G^{R}$ and the self-energy scattering terms in\n$\\Sigma^{<}$ produce the less-than Green's function $G^{<}$.

It is directly\nuseful for noise reduction, and frequently used as an intermediate step in\nhigher level algorithms. For example, it can be particularly useful in edge\ndetection and segmentation. Three well known algorithms for discontinuity\npreserving smoothing are nonlinear anisotropic diffusion, bilateral filtering,\nand mean shift filtering. Although slight differences make them each better\nsuited to different tasks, all are designed to preserve discontinuities while\nsmoothing. However, none of them satisfy this goal perfectly: they each have\nexception cases in which smoothing may occur across hard edges. The principal\ncontribution of this paper is the identification of a property we call edge\nawareness that should be satisfied by any discontinuity preserving smoothing\nalgorithm. This constraint can be incorporated into existing algorithms to\nimprove quality, and usually has negligible changes in runtime performance\nand/or complexity.

The\npolarization sensitivity would be more than 4.6 (21.2 in exposure time) times\nthe standard observation with the SOT spectro-polarimeter. The $LP$ map shows a\ncellular structure with a typical scale of $5\" - 10\"$. We find that the\nenhanced $LP$ signals essentially consist of the isolated sporadic transient\nhorizontal magnetic fields (THMFs) with life time of 1-10 min, and are not\ncontributed by long-duration weak horizontal magnetic fields. The cellular\nstructure coincides in position with the negative divergence of the horizontal\nflow field, i.e., mesogranular boundaries with downflows. Azimuth distribution\nappears to be random for the scale size of the mesogranules. Some pixels have\ntwo separate appearances of THMFs, and the measured time intervals are\nconsistent with the random appearance. THMFs tend to appear at the mesogranular\nboundaries, but appear randomly in time. We discuss the origin of THMFs based\non these observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 02:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

To\ncalculate spectral functions from DMRG, the correction vector method is\npresently the most widely used approach. One, however, always obtains\nLorentzian convoluted spectral functions, which in applications like the\ndynamical mean-field theory can lead to wrong results. In order to overcome\nthis restriction we show how to use the Lehmann formula to calculate a peak\nspectrum for the spectral function. We show that this peak spectrum is a very\ngood approximation to a deconvolution of the correction vector spectral\nfunction. Calculating this deconvoluted spectrum directly from the DMRG basis\nset and operators is the most natural approach, because it uses only\ninformation from the system itself. Having calculated this excitation spectrum,\none can use an arbitrary broadening to obtain a smooth spectral function, or\ndirectly analyze the excitations. As a nontrivial test we apply this method to\nobtain spectral functions for a model of three coupled Anderson impurities.\nAlthough, we are focusing in this article on impurity models, the proposed\nmethod for calculating the peak spectrum can be easily adapted to usual lattice\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 07:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 01:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

By contrast\nour analysis of the other light excited states clearly shows that for these\nstates the corrections at smaller l resum to a much smaller effective power.\nFinally, and in contrast to our recent calculations in D=3+1, we find no\nevidence for the presence of any non-stringy states that could indicate the\nexcitation of massive flux tube modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 09:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

A major advantage of our approach is that standard\nBose-Einstein-condensate temperatures are sufficient to observe magnetic\nphenomena like N\\'eel order and spin frustration. We are able to study a very\nrich phase diagram and even to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by\nfrustration. In addition, the quantum states realized in our spin simulator are\nyet unobserved superfluid phases with non-trivial long-range order and\nstaggered circulating plaquette currents, which break time reversal symmetry.\nThese findings open the route towards highly debated phases like spin-liquids\nand the study of the dynamics of quantum phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 14:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-23"}

We propose two metrics for measuring the\nreliability of wireless mesh routing topologies, one for flooding and one for\nunicast routing. The Flooding Path Probability (FPP) metric measures the\nend-to-end packet delivery probability when each node broadcasts a packet after\nhearing from all its upstream neighbors. The Unicast Retransmission Flow (URF)\nmetric measures the end-to-end packet delivery probability when a relay node\nretransmits a unicast packet on its outgoing links until it receives an\nacknowledgement or it tries all the links. Both metrics rely on specific packet\nforwarding models, rather than heuristics, to derive explicit expressions of\nthe end-to-end packet delivery probability from individual link probabilities\nand the underlying connectivity graph.\n  We also propose a distributed, greedy algorithm that uses the URF metric to\nconstruct a reliable routing topology. This algorithm constructs a Directed\nAcyclic Graph (DAG) from a weighted, undirected connectivity graph, where each\nlink is weighted by its success probability. The algorithm uses a vector of\ndecreasing reliability thresholds to coordinate when nodes can join the routing\ntopology. Simulations demonstrate that, on average, this algorithm constructs a\nmore reliable topology than the usual minimum hop DAG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 15:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-31"}

Such an entropy-equivalent\nis defined for scalar classicalons also and is responsible for exponential\nsuppression of their decay into small number of final particles. This parallel\nworks in both ways. For optimists that are willing to hypothesize that gravity\nmay indeed self-unitarize at high energies via black hole formation, it\nillustrates that the Goldstones may not be much different in this respect, and\nthey classicalize essentially by similar dynamics as gravitons. In the other\ndirection, it may serve as an useful de-mystifier of\nvia-black-hole-unitarization process and of the role of entropy in it, as it\nillustrates, that much more prosaic scalar theories essentially do the same.\nFinally, it illustrates that in both cases classicalization is the defining\nproperty for unitarization, and that it sets-in before one can talk about\naccompanying properties, such as entropy and thermality of static classicalons\n(black holes). These properties are by-products of classicalization, and their\nequivalents can be defined for non-gravitational cases of classicalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 15:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Formation of stable halos by collisional fluids with\nvery low mass particles appears as the most probable interpretation, while\nhalos formed by high mass particles, left over from a hot big bang, can\nscarcely explain the observed density distributions.

To resolve multipath components\narriving within a short interval, we propose a new algorithm called the\nleast-squares based iterative multipath super-resolution (LIMS). Compared to\nconventional super-resolution techniques, such as the multiple signal\nclassification (MUSIC) and the estimation of signal parameters via rotation\ninvariance techniques (ESPRIT), our algorithm has several appealing features.\nIn particular, even in critical situations where the conventional\nsuper-resolution techniques are not very powerful due to limited data or the\ncorrelation between path coefficients, the LIMS algorithm can produce\nsuccessful results. In addition, due to its iterative nature, the LIMS\nalgorithm is suitable for recursive multipath tracking, whereas the\nconventional super-resolution techniques may not be. Through numerical\nsimulations, we show that the LIMS algorithm can resolve the first arrival path\namong closely arriving independently faded multipaths with a much lower mean\nsquare error than can conventional early-late discriminator based techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 03:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The method uses a patented\nset of algorithms, implemented on the chips in such devices, to preserve\nconstant intelligibility of speech in noisy environments, rather than constant\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The algorithms analyze the noise background in real time\nand compensate only for fluctuating noise in the frequency domain and the time\ndomain that interferes with intelligibility of speech. Advantages of this\nmethod of controlling volume include: Controlling volume without sacrificing\nclarity; adjusting only for persistent speech-interference noise; smoothing\nvolume fluctuations; and eliminating static-like bursts caused by noise spikes.\nPractical human-factors approaches to implementing these algorithms in mobile\nphones are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 22:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 17:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}
