However, we\nseek to study these objects in a new enumerative context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2011 18:04:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2011 23:52:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 15:05:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 15:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-15"}

Upon encountering an enemy, the aircraft has the choice of\nspending any amount~$0\\le y\\le x$ of its ammunition, resulting in the\naircraft's survival with probability equal to some known increasing function of\n$y$. Two different goals have been considered in the literature concerning the\noptimal amount~$K(x,t)$ of ammunition spent: (i)~Maximizing the probability of\nsurviving for time~$t$, which is the so-called Bomber Problem, and (ii)\nmaximizing the number of enemy airplanes shot down during time~$t$, which we\ncall the Fighter Problem. Several authors have attempted to settle the\nfollowing conjectures about the monotonicity of $K(x,t)$: [A] $K(x,t)$ is\ndecreasing in $t$, [B] $K(x,t)$ is increasing in $x$, and [C] the\namount~$x-K(x,t)$ held back is increasing in $x$.

The\nlaw of the channel is presumed to be known to the receiver. In addition, we\nassume the power spectral density (PSD) of the fading process to be compactly\nsupported. For i.i.d. zero-mean proper Gaussian input distributions, we\ninvestigate the achievable rate. One of the main contributions is the\nderivation of two new upper bounds on the achievable rate with zero-mean proper\nGaussian input symbols. The first one holds only for the special case of a\nrectangular PSD and depends on the SNR and the spread of the PSD. Together with\na lower bound on the achievable rate, which is achievable with i.i.d. zero-mean\nproper Gaussian input symbols, we have found a set of bounds which is tight in\nthe sense that their difference is bounded. Furthermore, we show that the high\nSNR slope is characterized by a pre-log of 1-2f_d, where f_d is the normalized\nmaximum Doppler frequency. This pre-log is equal to the high SNR pre-log of the\npeak power constrained capacity. Furthermore, we derive an alternative upper\nbound on the achievable rate with i.i.d. input symbols which is based on the\none-step channel prediction error variance. The novelty lies in the fact that\nthis bound is not restricted to peak power constrained input symbols like known\nbounds, e.g. in [1]. Therefore, the derived upper bound can also be used to\nevaluate the achievable rate with i.i.d. proper Gaussian input symbols. We\ncompare the derived bounds on the achievable rate with i.i.d. zero-mean proper\nGaussian input symbols with bounds on the peak power constrained capacity given\nin [1-3].

The NH3 (1,1)\nand (2,2) lines provide diagnostics of the temperature and density structure\nwithin the IRDC, with typical rotation temperatures of ~10 to 20K and NH3\ncolumn densities of ~10^15 cm^-2. The estimated total mass of G19.30+0.07 is\n~1130 Msun. The cloud comprises four compact NH3 clumps of mass ~30 to 160\nMsun. Two coincide with 24 micron emission, indicating heating by protostars,\nand show evidence of outflow in the NH3 emission. We report a water maser\nassociated with a third clump; the fourth clump is apparently starless.

Based on\nanalysis of images of the cloud of material ejected from Comet 9P/Tempel 1\nafter the collision of the Deep Impact (DI) module with the comet, we studied\nthe time variations in the rate and velocities of ejection of observed\nparticles (mainly icy particles with diameter d<3 micron). Comparison of these\ndependencies with the theoretical dependencies allowed us to understand the\ntime variations in the rate of the outburst triggered by the impact. The latter\nvariations testify in favor of that there were cavities at the place of DI\nejection. The beginning of the increase of the main outburst at 8 s after the\nDI impact could be caused by excavation of a relatively large cavity that\ncontained dust and gas under pressure. The upper boarder of the cavity could be\nlocated at about 5-10 meters below the surface of the comet. This cavity could\nbe deep because the excavation from the cavity could last for at least a few\ntens of seconds. With the increase of the crater, more cavities could be\nexcavated. The outburst decreased at ~60 s after the impact. Besides the 'fast'\noutburst caused by ejection from cavities, there was a 'slow' outburst\nejection, which was similar to the ejection from a 'fresh' surface of a comet\nand could be noticeable during 30-60 min. The 'fast' outburst with velocities\n~100 m/s probably could continue for at least several tens of seconds, and it\ncould significantly increase the fraction of particles ejected with velocities\n~100 m/s compared with theoretical models of ejection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 01:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-03"}

It is\nproved in this paper that the constant can not be zero. The metric of inner\ngravity field of hollow sphere is calculated at first. Then let the inner\nradius of hollow sphere become zero, we obtain the metric of inner gravity\nfield of solid sphere. Based on the definition of energy momentum tensor of\ngeneral relativity, the gravity masses of hollow and solid spheres in curved\nspace are calculated strictly. The results indicate that no matter what the\nmasses and densities of hollow sphere and solid sphere are, space-time\nsingularities would appear in the centers of spheres. Meanwhile, no matter what\nthe mass and density are, the intensity of pressure at the center point of\nsolid sphere can not be infinite. That is to say, the material can not collapse\ntowards the center of so-called black hole. In stead, it may be that there\nexist the spherical surfaces of infinite pressure inside the hollow and solid\nspheres, and material would collapse toward the surfaces so that the common\nspheres are unsteady. At the center of solid sphere and on its neighboring\nregion, pressure intensities would become negative values. There may be a\nregion for hollow sphere in which pressure intensities would become negative\nvalues too. The results only indicate that the singularity black holes\npredicated by general relativity are caused by the descriptive method of curved\nspace-time and can not exist in nature actually.

In particular, stationary GW fields are considered and the\nresulting formulae are evaluated for two general types of GW radiation:\nradiation from a particular astrophysical source (e.g., a binary system) and a\nstochastic background of gravitational waves (SBGW). Expected sources and\nsignal strengths for both types of GW radiation are reviewed and discussed.\nNumerical results for the Sun show that low-order quadrupolar g modes are\nexcited more strongly than p modes by orders of magnitude. Maximal rms surface\nvelocities in the case of excitation by astrophysical sources are found to be v\n{\\le} 10^(-8) mm/s, assuming GW strain amplitudes of h {\\le} 10^(-20).

This\neffect is caused by exponentially decaying (evanescent) waves which form the\nphoton tunnel between two transparent boundaries. However, in the mid-infrared\nrange it holds when the gap between two media is as small as few tens of\nnanometers. We propose a new paradigm of the radiation heat transfer which\nmakes possible the strong photon tunneling for micron thick gaps. For it the\nair gap between two media should be modified, so that evanescent waves are\ntransformed inside it into propagating ones. This modification is achievable\nusing a metamaterial so that the direct thermal conductance through the\nmetamaterial is practically absent and the photovoltaic conversion of the\ntransferred heat is not altered by the metamaterial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 12:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We have found that -- for both the spin-polarized\ncurrents -- two types of the current hysteresis appear on the current-voltage\ncharacteristics. The current hysteresis of the first type occurs at the bias\nvoltage below the resonant current peak and results from the accumulation of\nelectrons in the quantum well layer. The current hysteresis of the second type\nappears at the bias voltage above the resonant current peak and is caused by\nthe creation of the quasi-bound state in the left contact region and the\nresonant tunneling through this quasi-bound state. The physical interpretation\nof both the types of the current hysteresis is further supported by the\nanalysis of the calculated self-consistent potential profiles and electron\ndensity distributions. Based on these results we have shown that -- in certain\nbias voltage and magnetic field ranges -- the spin polarization of the current\nexhibits the plateau behavior with the nearly full spin polarization. This\nproperty is very promising for possible applications in spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 12:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-03"}

Because high relative velocities in\nbetween micrometer-sized and macroscopic particles exist in protoplanetary\ndisks, we present experimental results on the erosion of macroscopic\nagglomerates consisting of micrometer-sized spherical particles via the impact\nof micrometer-sized particles. We find that after an initial phase, in which an\nimpacting particle erodes up to 10 particles of an agglomerate, the impacting\nparticles compress the agglomerate's surface, which partly passivates the\nagglomerates against erosion. Due to this effect the erosion halts within our\nerror bars for impact velocities up to ~30 m/s. For larger velocities, the\nerosion is reduced by an order of magnitude. This outcome is explained and\nconfirmed by a numerical model. In a next step we build an analytical disk\nmodel and implement the experimentally found erosive effect. The model shows\nthat erosion is a strong source of micrometer-sized particles in a\nprotoplanetary disk.

To study the\nimpact of primary traffic uncertainty, we propose a block activity model that\ncaptures the random on-off periods of primary's transmissions. Each block in\nthe model can be split into parallel Gaussian-mixture channels, such that each\nchannel resembles a multiple user channel (MAC) from the point of view of the\nsecondary user. The secondary senses the current state of the primary at the\nstart of each block. We show that the optimal power transmitted depends on the\nsensed state and the optimal power profile is paranoid, i.e. either growing or\ndecaying in power as a function of time. We show that such a scheme achieves\ncapacity when there is no noise in the sensing. The optimal transmission for\nthe secondary performs rate splitting and follows a layered water-filling power\nallocation for each parallel channel to achieve capacity. The secondary rate\napproaches a genie-aided scheme for large block-lengths. Additionally, if the\nfraction of time primary uses the channel tends to one, the paranoid scheme and\nthe genie-aided upper bound get arbitrarily close to a no-sensing scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 15:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-03"}
