This study considers two\ntypes of pedestrians: familiar and unfamiliar with the facility. Four\nstrategies are modelled to cover those groups. The modelled strategies are the\nshortest path (local and global); They are combined with a quickest path\napproach, which is based on an observation principle. In the quickest path\napproach, pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment\nand are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit\nanalysis function.

The core-softened\npair interactions have two length scales, such that the longer length scale\nassociated with a shallow, attractive well is kept constant while the shorter\nlength scale associated with the repulsive shoulder is varied from an inflexion\npoint to a minimum of progressively increasing depth.\n  As the shoulder well depth increases, the pressure required to form the high\ndensity liquid decreases and the temperature up to which the high-density\nliquid is stable increases, resulting in the shift of the liquid-liquid\ncritical point to much lower pressures and higher temperatures. The pair\ncorrelation entropy is computed to show that the excess entropy anomaly\ndiminishes when the shoulder well depth increases. Excess entropy scaling of\ndiffusivity in this class of fluids is demonstrated, showing that decreasing\nstrength of the excess entropy anomaly with increasing shoulder depth results\nin the progressive loss of water-like thermodynamic, structural and transport\nanomalies. Instantaneous normal mode analysis was used to index the overall\ncurvature distribution of the fluid and the fraction of imaginary frequency\nmodes was shown to correlate well with the anomalous behaviour of the\ndiffusivity and the pair correlation entropy.

Among 74 galaxies detected in the Spitzer\nIRAC 3.6 and 4.5um bands, more than 70% of the galaxies show clear excess at\n3.6um compared to the expected flux density from stellar continuum only. We\nprovide evidence that this 3.6um excess is due to Halpha emission redshifted\ninto the 3.6um band, and classify these 3.6um excess galaxies to be Halpha\nemitter (HAE) candidates.

Possible reasons for such strong Halpha emission in these\ngalaxies include different dust extinction properties, young stellar population\nage, continuous star formation history, low metallicity, and top-heavy stellar\ninitial mass function. Although the correlation between UV slope beta and\nL(Ha)/L(UV) raises the possibility that HAEs prefer a dust extinction curve\nwhich is steeper in the UV, the most dominant factor that results in strong\nHalpha emission appears to be star formation history. The Halpha equivalent\nwidths of HAEs are large despite their relatively old stellar population ages\nconstrained by SED fitting, suggesting that at least 60% of HAEs produce stars\nat a constant rate. Under the assumption that the cold gas supply is sustained,\nHAEs are able to produce ~50% of the observed stellar mass density at z~3 that\nis caught in massive (M*>10^11 Msun) galaxies.

They have been the subject of extensive investigation\nduring the last decades. Roughly speaking, they are a certain decomposition of\na given space into cells, induced by a distance function and by a tuple of\nsubsets called the generators or the sites. Consider the following question:\ndoes a small change of the sites, e.g., of their position or shape, yield a\nsmall change in the corresponding Voronoi cells? This question is by all means\nnatural and fundamental, since in practice one approximates the sites either\nbecause of inexact information about them, because of inevitable numerical\nerrors in their representation, for simplification purposes and so on, and it\nis important to know whether the resulting Voronoi cells approximate the real\nones well. The traditional approach to Voronoi diagrams, and, in particular, to\n(variants of) this question, is combinatorial. However, it seems that there has\nbeen a very limited discussion in the geometric sense (the shape of the cells),\nmainly an intuitive one, without proofs, in Euclidean spaces. We formalize this\nquestion precisely, and then show that the answer is positive in the case of\nR^d, or, more generally, in (possibly infinite dimensional) uniformly convex\nnormed spaces, assuming there is a common positive lower bound on the distance\nbetween the sites.

We determine the kinematics, ionization parameter (log U ~\n-2.5 +- 0.03), column density (N_H ~ 10^{21} cm^{-2}), metallicity ([M/H] ~\n-0.20 +- 0.15), and mass (~ 10^8 Msun) of the gaseous bridge. We simultaneously\nconstrain properties of the QSO-host (M_DM>8.8x 10^{11} Msun) and its companion\ngalaxy (M_DM>2.1 x 10^{11} Msun; M_star ~ 2 x 10^{10} Msun; stellar burst\nage=300-800 Myr; SFR~6 Msun/yr; and metallicity 12+log (O/H)= 8.64 +- 0.2). The\ngeneral properties of this system match the standard paradigm of a\ngalaxy-galaxy merger caught between first and second passage while one of the\ngalaxies hosts an active quasar. The companion galaxy lies in the so-called\n`green valley', with a stellar population consistent with a recent starburst\ntriggered during the first passage of the merger and has no detectable AGN\nactivity. In addition to providing case-studies of quasars associated with\ngalaxy mergers, quasar/galaxy pairs with QSO-photoionized tidal bridges such as\nthis one offer unique insights into the galaxy properties while also\ndistinguishing an important and inadequately understood phase of galaxy\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 20:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The effects of the water supply rate, plane\nslope and air stream velocity on the spacing and height of ice surface\nroughness are investigated from a new type of morphological instability of the\nice-water interface. The proposed macro-scale morphological instability under a\nsupercooled water film is quite different from the micro-scale one which\nresults in dendritic growth.

This\ntransition is commonly characterized by the asymptotic loss of the interference\nterm in the Wigner representation of the cat state. In this paper we show that\nthe quantum to classical transition has different dynamical features depending\non the measure for nonclassicality used. Measures based on an operatorial\ndefinition have well defined physical meaning and allow a deeper understanding\nof the quantum to classical transition. Our analysis shows that, for most\nnonclassicality measures, the Schr\\\"odinger cat dies after a finite time.\nMoreover, our results challenge the prevailing idea that more macroscopic\nstates are more susceptible to decoherence in the sense that the transition\nfrom quantum to classical occurs faster. Since nonclassicality is prerequisite\nfor entanglement generation our results also bridge the gap between\ndecoherence, which appears to be only asymptotic, and entanglement, which may\nshow a sudden death. In fact, whereas the loss of coherences still remains\nasymptotic, we have shown that the transition from quantum to classical can\nindeed occur at a finite time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 20:58:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 15:14:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 13:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 12:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The observational\ninputs are the SDSS central blue and red Galaxy Stellar Mass Functions reported\nin Yang et al. 2009, and the measured local gas mass-Ms relations for blue and\nred galaxies. For the Halo Mass Function associated to central blue galaxies,\nthe distinct LCDM one is used and set up to exclude: (i) the observed\ngroup/cluster mass function (blue galaxies are rare as centers of\ngroups/clusters), and (ii) halos with a central major merger at resdshifts\nz<0.8 (dry late major mergers destroy the disks of blue galaxies). For red\ngalaxies, we take the complement of this function to the total. The obtained\nmean Ms-Mh and Mb-Mh relations of central blue and red galaxies do not differ\nsignificantly from the respective relations for all central galaxies. For\nMh>10^11.5 Msun, the Ms's of red galaxies tend to be higher than those of blue\nones for a given Mh, the difference not being larger than 1.7. For Mh<10^11.5\nMsun, this trend is inverted. For blue (red) galaxies: (a) the maximum value of\nfs=Ms/Mh is 0.021^{+0.016}_{-0.009} (0.034{+0.026}_{-0.015}) and it is attained\natlog(Mh/Msun)~12.0 (log(Mh/Msun)~11.9); (b) fs\\propto Mh (fs\\propto Mh^3) at\nthe low-mass end while at the high-mass end, fs\\propto Mh^-0.4 (fs\\propto\nMh^-0.6).

We use the\nHanle effect to predict variations in net line polarization, and use geometric\narguments to generalize these results to linear polarization due to other\nmechanisms. Methods: Building on the work of Lopez Ariste et al., we use simple\nanalytic models of rotating stars that are symmetric except for an axisymmetric\nmagnetic field to predict the polarization lightcurve due to the Hanle effect.\nWe highlight the effects for the variable line polarization as a function of\nviewing inclination and field axis obliquity. Finally, we use geometric\narguments to generalize our results to linear polarization from the weak\ntransverse Zeeman effect. Results: We derive analytic expressions to\ndemonstrate that the variable polarization lightcurve for an oblique magnetic\nrotator is symmetric. This holds for any axisymmetric field distribution and\narbitrary viewing inclination to the rotation axis. Conclusions: For the\nsituation under consideration, the amplitude of the polarization variation is\nset by the Hanle effect, but the shape of the variation in polarization with\nphase depends largely on geometrical projection effects. Our work generalizes\nthe applicability of results described in Lopez Ariste et al., inasmuch as the\nassumptions of a spherical star and an axisymmetric field are true, and\nprovides a strategy for separating the effects of perspective from the Hanle\neffect itself for interpreting polarimetric lightcurves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 21:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The identifying features of the\nsupersymmetric spectrum are a light stop and gluino, with both sparticles much\nlighter than all the additional squarks. This unique mass hierarchy leads to\nthe enhanced production of events with an ultra-high multiplicity of hadronic\njets which should be clearly visible to the \\sqrt{s} = 7 TeV LHC at only 1\ninverse fb of integrated luminosity.

This is due to the mathematical isomorphism between the conformal\ngroup of certain 3 dimensional slices of de Sitter space and the de Sitter\nisometry group SO(4,1). In the standard homogeneous isotropic cosmological\nmodel in which primordial density perturbations are generated during a long\nvacuum energy dominated de Sitter phase, the embedding of flat spatial sections\nin de Sitter space induces a conformal invariant perturbation spectrum and\ndefinite prediction for the shape of the non-Gaussian CMB bispectrum. In the\ncase in which the density fluctuations are generated instead on the de Sitter\nhorizon, conformal invariance of the horizon embedding implies a different but\nalso quite definite prediction for the angular correlations of CMB\nnon-Gaussianity on the sky. Each of these forms for the bispectrum is intrinsic\nto the symmetries of de Sitter space and in that sense, independent of specific\nmodel assumptions. Each is different from the predictions of single field slow\nroll inflation models which rely on the breaking of de Sitter invariance. We\npropose a quantum origin for the CMB fluctuations in the scalar gravitational\nsector from the conformal anomaly that could give rise to these\nnon-Gaussianities without a slow roll inflaton field, and argue that conformal\ninvariance also leads to the expectation for the relation n_S-1=n_T between the\nspectral indices of the scalar and tensor power spectrum. Confirmation of this\nprediction or detection of non-Gaussian correlations in the CMB of one of the\nbispectral shape functions predicted by conformal invariance can be used both\nto establish the physical origins of primordial density fluctuations and\ndistinguish between different dynamical models of cosmological vacuum dark\nenergy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 21:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 01:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

Because of an insidious software error, what we reported as Stokes V\nis actually Stokes U: the revised Stokes V spectrum indicates a 3-sigma upper\nlimit of B_los < 17 microgauss. The correct analysis reveals an absorption\nfeature in fractional polarization that is offset in velocity from the Stokes I\nspectrum by -1.9 km/s. The polarization position-angle spectrum shows a dip\nthat is also significantly offset from the Stokes I feature, but at a velocity\nthat differs slightly from the absorption feature in fractional polarization.\nWe model the absorption feature with 3 velocity components against the core-jet\nstructure of 3C 286. Our chisquare minimization fitting results in components\nwith differing (1) ratios of H I column density to spin temperature, (2)\nvelocity centroids, and (3) velocity dispersions. The change in polarization\nposition angle with frequency implies incomplete coverage of the background jet\nsource by the absorber. It also implies a spatial variation of the polarization\nposition angle across the jet source, which is observed at frequencies higher\nthan the 839.4 MHz absorption frequency. The multi-component structure of the\ngas is best understood in terms of components with spatial scales of ~100 pc\ncomprised of hundreds of low-temperature (T < 200 K) clouds with linear\ndimensions of about 1 pc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 22:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We address the question of the lowest\nallowed flavor symmetry scale consistent with data. Because of the mechanism\nrecently pointed out by Grinstein et al. tree-level flavor changing neutral\ncurrents turn out to play a very weak constraining role. The same occurs, in\nour model, for electroweak precision observables. The main constraint turns out\nto come from WR-mediated flavor changing neutral current box diagrams,\nprimarily K - Kbar mixing. In the case where discrete parity symmetry is\npresent at the TeV scale, this constraint implies lower bounds on the mass of\nvectorlike fermions and flavor bosons of 5 and 10 TeV respectively. However,\nthese limits are weakened under the condition that only SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} is\nrestored at the TeV scale, but not parity. For example, assuming the SU(2)\ngauge couplings in the ratio gR/gL approx 0.7 allows the above limits to go\ndown by half for both vectorlike fermions and flavor bosons. Our model provides\na framework for accommodating neutrino masses and, in the parity symmetric\ncase, provides a solution to the strong CP problem.

When removing an equal number of\nA and B sites of the graphene bipartite lattice, the nanomesh made mostly of\nzigzag (armchair) type edges exhibit antiferromagnetic (spin unpolarized)\nstates. In contrast, in situation of sublattice symmetry breaking, stable\nferri(o)magnetic states are obtained. For hydrogen-passivated nanomesh, the\nformation energy is dramatically decreased, and ground state is found to\nstrongly depend on the vacancies shape and size. For triangular shaped holes,\nthe obtained net magnetic moments increase with the number difference of\nremoved A and B sites in agreement with Lieb's theorem for even A+B. For odd\nA+B triangular meshes and all cases of non-triangular nanomeshes including the\none with even A+B, Lieb's theorem does not hold anymore which can be partially\nattributed to introduction of armchair edges.

Taking the standard\nmarket equilibrium approach, upon receiving submitted bid vectors from the\nbuyers, the market maker will decide on a price vector to clear the market in\nsuch a way that each buyer is allocated an item for which he desires the most\n(a.k.a., a market equilibrium solution). While such equilibrium outcomes are\nnot unique, the market maker chooses one (maxeq) that optimizes its own\nobjective --- revenue maximization. The buyers in turn change bids to their\nbest interests in order to obtain higher utilities in the next round's market\nequilibrium solution.\n  This is an (n+1)-person game where buyers place strategic bids to gain the\nmost from the market maker's equilibrium mechanism. The incentives of buyers in\ndeciding their bids and the market maker's choice of using the maxeq mechanism\ncreate a wave of Nash dynamics involved in the market. We characterize Nash\nequilibria in the dynamics in terms of the relationship between maxeq and mineq\n(i.e., minimum revenue equilibrium), and develop convergence results for Nash\ndynamics from the maxeq policy to a mineq solution, resulting an outcome\nequivalent to the truthful VCG mechanism.\n  Our results imply revenue equivalence between maxeq and mineq, and address\nthe question that why short-term revenue maximization is a poor long run\nstrategy, in a deterministic and dynamic setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2011 03:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-23"}

Quantifying the performance of\nmulti-cell cooperation is challenging as it integrates physical-layer\ntechniques and network topologies. For tractability, existing work typically\nrelies on the over-simplified Wyner-type models. In this paper, we propose a\nnew stochastic-geometry model for a cellular network with multi-cell\ncooperation, which accounts for practical factors including the irregular\nlocations of base stations (BSs) and the resultant path-losses. In particular,\nthe proposed network-topology model has three key features: i) the cells are\nmodeled using a Poisson random tessellation generated by Poisson distributed\nBSs, ii) multi-antenna BSs are clustered using a hexagonal lattice and BSs in\nthe same cluster mitigate mutual interference by spatial interference\navoidance, iii) BSs near cluster edges access a different sub-channel from that\nby other BSs, shielding cluster-edge mobiles from strong interference. Using\nthis model and assuming sparse scattering, we analyze the shapes of the outage\nprobabilities of mobiles served by cluster-interior BSs as the average number\n$K$ of BSs per cluster increases. The outage probability of a mobile near a\ncluster center is shown to be proportional to $e^{-c(2-\\sqrt{\\nu})^2K}$ where\n$\\nu$ is the fraction of BSs lying in the interior of clusters and $c$ is a\nconstant. Moreover, the outage probability of a typical mobile is proved to\nscale proportionally with $e^{-c' (1-\\sqrt{\\nu})^2K}$ where $c'$ is a constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2011 07:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-23"}

We use a\nself-consistent model for the neutrino production, in which protons interact\nwith synchrotron photons from co-accelerated electrons, and we fully take into\naccount the relevant pion and kaon production modes, the flavor composition at\nthe source, flavor mixing, and magnetic field effects on the secondaries\n(pions, muon, and kaons). Since some of the model parameters can be related to\nthe Hillas parameters R (size of the acceleration region) and B (magnetic\nfield), we relate the detector response to the Hillas plane. In order to\ncompare the response to different spectral shapes, we use the energy flux\ndensity as a measure for the pion production efficiency times luminosity of the\nsource. We demonstrate that IceCube has a very good reach in this quantity for\nAGN nuclei and jets for all source declinations, while the spectra of sources\nwith strong magnetic fields are found outside the optimal reach.

We focus on collisions between\nmagnetically trapped NH molecules, but the theory is general for any two\nparamagnetic species for which the electronic spin and its space-fixed\nprojection are (approximately) good quantum numbers. It is shown that dipolar\nspin relaxation is directly associated with magnetic-dipole induced avoided\ncrossings that occur between different adiabatic potential curves. For a given\ncollision energy and magnetic field strength, the cross-section contributions\nfrom different scattering channels depend strongly on whether or not the\ncorresponding avoided crossings are energetically accessible. We find that the\ncrossings become lower in energy as the magnetic field decreases, so that\nhigher partial-wave scattering becomes increasingly important \\textit{below} a\ncertain magnetic field strength. In addition, we derive analytical\ncross-section expressions for dipolar spin relaxation based on the Born\napproximation and distorted-wave Born approximation. The validity regions of\nthese analytical expressions are determined by comparison with the NH + NH\ncross sections obtained from full coupled-channel calculations. We find that\nthe Born approximation is accurate over a wide range of energies and field\nstrengths, but breaks down at high energies and high magnetic fields. The\nanalytical distorted-wave Born approximation gives more accurate results in the\ncase of s-wave scattering, but shows some significant discrepancies for the\nhigher partial-wave channels. We thus conclude that the Born approximation\ngives generally more meaningful results than the distorted-wave Born\napproximation at the collision energies and fields considered in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2011 14:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
