This phase emerges because the molecules may interact with\neach other via a potential V_0(r) that has an attractive dipole-dipole 1/r^3\ntail, which provides p-wave superfluid pairing at fairly high temperatures. We\ncalculate the amplitude of elastic p-wave scattering in the potential V_0(r)\ntaking into account both the anomalous scattering due to the dipole-dipole tail\nand the short-range contribution. This amplitude is then used for the\nanalytical and numerical solution of the renormalized BCS gap equation which\nincludes the second order Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov corrections and the\ncorrection related to the effective mass of the quasiparticles. We find that\nthe critical temperature T_c can be varied within a few orders of magnitude by\nmodifying the short-range part of the potential V_0(r). The decay of the system\nvia collisional relaxation of molecules to dressed states with lower energies\nis rather slow due to the necessity of a large momentum transfer. The presence\nof a constant transverse electric field reduces the inelastic rate, and the\nlifetime of the system can be of the order of seconds even at 2D densities ~\n10^9 cm^{-2}. This leads to T_c of up to a few tens of nanokelvins and makes it\nrealistic to obtain the topological p_x+ip_y phase in experiments with\nultracold polar molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2011 16:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 10:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-26"}

One of these is the\nspeed of the system. It can be proven that the multidimensional DB organization\nresults in shorter response times. And it is crucial, since a manager may\nbecome impatient, if he or she has to wait say more than 20 seconds for the\nnext screen. On the other hand, we have to pay for the speed with a bigger DB\nsize. Why does the size of MD databases grow so quickly? The reason is the\nsparsity of data: The MD matrix contains many empty cells. Efficient handling\nof sparse matrices is indispensable in an OLAP application. One way to handle\nsparsity is to take the structure closer to the table-based one. Thus the DB\nsize decreases, while the application gets slower. Therefore, other methods are\nneeded.

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to reduce the feedback load in\na downlink orthogonal space division multiple access (SDMA) system with\nzero-forcing receivers by allowing the users to dynamically determine the\nnumber of feedback bits to use according to multiple decision thresholds.\nThrough theoretical analysis, we show that, while keeping the aggregate\nfeedback load of the entire system constant regardless of the number of users,\nthe proposed scheme almost achieves the optimal asymptotic sum rate scaling\nwith respect to the number of users (also known as the multiuser diversity).\nSpecifically, given the number of thresholds, the proposed scheme can achieve a\nconstant portion of the optimal sum rate achievable only by the system where\nall the users always feedback, and the remaining portion (referred to as the\nsum rate loss) decreases exponentially to zero as the number of thresholds\nincreases. By deriving a tight upper bound for the sum rate loss, the minimum\nnumber of thresholds for a given tolerable sum rate loss is determined. In\naddition, a fast bit allocation method is discussed for the proposed scheme,\nand the simulation results show that the sum rate performances with the complex\noptimal bit allocation method and with the fast algorithm are almost the same.\nWe compare our multi-threshold scheme to some previously proposed feedback\nschemes.

We investigate this issue by focusing on the planet-formation stage\nthat is arguably the most sensitive to binary perturbations: the mutual\naccretion of kilometre-sized planetesimals. To this effect we numerically\nestimate the impact velocities $dv$ amongst a population of circumprimary\nplanetesimals. We find that most of the circumprimary disc is strongly hostile\nto planetesimal accretion, especially the region around 2.6AU (the planet's\nlocation) where binary perturbations induce planetesimal-shattering $dv$ of\nmore than 1km/s. Possible solutions to the paradox of having a planet in such\naccretion-hostile regions are 1) that initial planetesimals were very big, at\nleast 250km, 2) that the binary had an initial orbit at least twice the present\none, and was later compacted due to early stellar encounters, 3) that\nplanetesimals did not grow by mutual impacts but by sweeping of dust (the\n\"snowball\" growth mode identified by Xie et al., 2010b), or 4) that HD196885Ab\nwas formed not by core-accretion but by the concurent disc instability\nmechanism.

Two prominent examples are\nstudied by implementing this robust and universal mechanism into AdS/QCD\ngravity duals. In the baryon sector bulk-mass corrections are used to describe\nsystematic good (i.e. maximally attractive) diquark effects.

The\ncase of this problem on polygonal obstacles is well studied. In this paper, we\nconsider the problem version on curved obstacles, commonly modeled as\nsplinegons. A splinegon can be viewed as replacing each edge of a polygon by a\nconvex curved edge (polygons are special splinegons). Each curved edge is\nassumed to be of O(1) complexity. Given in the plane two points s and t and a\nset of $h$ pairwise disjoint splinegons with a total of $n$ vertices, we\ncompute a shortest s-to-t path avoiding the splinegons, in\n$O(n+h\\log^{1+\\epsilon}h+k)$ time, where k is a parameter sensitive to the\nstructures of the input splinegons and is upper-bounded by $O(h^2)$. In\nparticular, when all splinegons are convex, $k$ is proportional to the number\nof common tangents in the free space (called \"free common tangents\") among the\nsplinegons. We develop techniques for solving the problem on the general\n(non-convex) splinegon domain, which also improve several previous results. In\nparticular, our techniques produce an optimal output-sensitive algorithm for a\nbasic visibility problem of computing all free common tangents among $h$\npairwise disjoint convex splinegons with a total of $n$ vertices. Our algorithm\nruns in $O(n+h\\log h+k)$ time and $O(n)$ space, where $k$ is the number of all\nfree common tangents. Even for the special case where all splinegons are convex\npolygons, the previously best algorithm for this visibility problem takes\n$O(n+h^2\\log n)$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 02:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 22:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

Conventional BCS theory predicts that the\nkinetic energy of carriers increases in the transition from the normal to the\nsuperconducting state. However, substantial experimental evidence obtained in\nrecent years indicates that in at least some superconductors the opposite\noccurs. Motivated in part by these experiments many novel mechanisms of\nsuperconductivity have recently been proposed where the transition to\nsuperconductivity is associated with a lowering of the kinetic energy of the\ncarriers. However none of these proposed unconventional mechanisms explores the\nfundamental reason for kinetic energy lowering nor its wider implications. Here\nI propose that kinetic energy lowering is at the root of the Meissner effect,\nthe most fundamental property of superconductors. The physics can be understood\nat the level of a single electron atom: kinetic energy lowering and enhanced\ndiamagnetic susceptibility are intimately connected. According to the theory of\nhole superconductivity, superconductors expel negative charge from their\ninterior driven by kinetic energy lowering and in the process expel any\nmagnetic field lines present in their interior. Associated with this we predict\nthe existence of a macroscopic electric field in the interior of\nsuperconductors and the existence of macroscopic quantum zero-point motion in\nthe form of a spin current in the ground state of superconductors (spin\nMeissner effect). In turn, the understanding of the role of kinetic energy\nlowering in superconductivity suggests a new way to understand the fundamental\norigin of kinetic energy lowering in quantum mechanics quite generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 03:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-18"}

Ambiguity sparse processes are\ndefined for a fixed sampling regime, in terms of a given number of sample\npoints and a fixed sampling period. The framework naturally allows us to treat\nheterogeneously nonstationary processes, and to develop methodology for\nprocesses that have growing but controlled complexity with increasing sample\nsizes and shrinking sampling periods. Expressions for the moments of the sample\nambiguity function are derived for ambiguity sparse processes. These properties\ninspire an Empirical Bayes shrinkage estimation procedure. The representation\nof the covariance structure of the process in terms of a time-frequency\nrepresentation is separated from the estimation of these second order\nproperties. The estimated ambiguity function is converted into an estimate of\nthe time-varying moments of the process, and from these moments, any bilinear\nrepresentation can be calculated with reduced estimation risk. Any of these\nrepresentations can be used to understand the time-varying spectral content of\nthe signal. The choice of representation is discussed.

The influence of antisymmentrization\nin the Hoyle state on the bosonic character of the $\\alpha$ particle is\ndiscussed in detail. It is shown to be weak. The bosonic aspects in the Hoyle\nstate, therefore, are predominant. It is conjectured that $\\alpha$-particle\ncondensate states also exist in heavier $n\\alpha$ nuclei, like $^{16}$O,\n$^{20}$Ne, etc. For instance the $0^+_6$ state of $^{16}$O at $E_{x}=15.1$ MeV\nis identified from a theoretical analysis as being a strong candidate of a\n$4\\alpha$ condensate. The calculated small width (34 keV) of $0^+_6$,\nconsistent with data, lends credit to the existence of heavier Hoyle-analogue\nstates.

It is well known that using a single importance sampling step one\nproduces an approximation for the target that deteriorates as the dimension $d$\nincreases, unless the number of Monte Carlo samples $N$ increases at an\nexponential rate in $d$. We show that this degeneracy can be avoided by\nintroducing a sequence of artificial targets, starting from a `simple' density\nand moving to the one of interest, using an SMC method to sample from the\nsequence. Using this class of SMC methods with a fixed number of samples, one\ncan produce an approximation for which the effective sample size (ESS)\nconverges to a random variable $\\varepsilon_N$ as $d\\rightarrow\\infty$ with\n$1<\\varepsilon_{N}<N$.

The partial\ncribbing scheme is especially motivated by the additive noise Gaussian MAC\nsince perfect cribbing results in the degenerated case of full cooperation\nbetween the encoders and requires an infinite entropy link. We derive a single\nletter characterization of the capacity of the MAC with partial cribbing for\nthe cases of causal and strictly causal partial cribbing. Several numerical\nexamples, such as quantized cribbing, are presented. We further consider and\nderive the capacity region where the cribbing depends on actions that are\nfunctions of the previous cribbed observations. In particular, we consider a\nscenario where the action is \"to crib or not to crib\" and show that a naive\ntime-sharing strategy is not optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 13:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

The available information are typically lists of\nhomologous (lexical, phonological, syntactic) features or characters for many\ndifferent languages.\n  From this perspective the reconstruction of language trees is an example of\ninverse problems: starting from present, incomplete and often noisy,\ninformation, one aims at inferring the most likely past evolutionary history. A\nfundamental issue in inverse problems is the evaluation of the inference made.\nA standard way of dealing with this question is to generate data with\nartificial models in order to have full access to the evolutionary process one\nis going to infer. This procedure presents an intrinsic limitation: when\ndealing with real data sets, one typically does not know which model of\nevolution is the most suitable for them. A possible way out is to compare\nalgorithmic inference with expert classifications. This is the point of view we\ntake here by conducting a thorough survey of the accuracy of reconstruction\nmethods as compared with the Ethnologue expert classifications. We focus in\nparticular on state-of-the-art distance-based methods for phylogeny\nreconstruction using worldwide linguistic databases.\n  In order to assess the accuracy of the inferred trees we introduce and\ncharacterize two generalizations of standard definitions of distances between\ntrees. Based on these scores we quantify the relative performances of the\ndistance-based algorithms considered. Further we quantify how the completeness\nand the coverage of the available databases affect the accuracy of the\nreconstruction. Finally we draw some conclusions about where the accuracy of\nthe reconstructions in historical linguistics stands and about the leading\ndirections to improve it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 13:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

It is based on the\nsimple premise that the gas in very young (tau < few Myr) clusters is largely\ncoincident with the cluster stars, is in a small, ring-like structure\nsurrounding the stars in slightly older clusters (e.g., tau ~5 Myr), and is in\na larger ring-like bubble for still older clusters (i.e., ~5-10 Myr). The\nsecond method is based on an observed relation between pixel-to-pixel flux\nvariations within clusters and their ages. This method relies on the fact that\nthe brightest individual stars in a cluster are most prominent at ages around\n10 Myr, and fall below the detection limit (i.e., M_V < -3.5) for ages older\nthan about 100 Myr. These two methods are the basis for a new morphological\nclassification system which can be used to estimate the ages of star clusters\nbased on their appearance. We compare previous age estimates of clusters in M83\ndetermined from fitting UBVI Halpha measurements using predictions from stellar\nevolutionary models with our new morphological categories and find good\nagreement at the ~95% level. The scatter within categories is ~0.1 dex in log\ntau for young clusters (<10 Myr) and ~0.5 dex for older (>10 Myr) clusters. A\nby-product of this study is the identification of 22 \"single-star\" HII regions\nin M83, with central stars having ages ~4 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 14:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

It is shown that the dynamics of these\nworlds with the additional fourth large-scale spatial dimension leads to an\nimportant effect. At 3R-worlds the forces of repulsion appear. The source of\nthese forces is the thermal energy of the radiation that fills these worlds. In\nthe four-dimensional space, these forces are centrifugal. They operate in an\nexternal for 3R-world spatial dimension and stretch it. In the\nthree-dimensional comoving coordinate system the centrifugal forces shows\nthemselves as forces of repulsion. Standard Einstein's equations do not\ndescribe these forces.\n  Written generalized Einstein's equation describing the dynamics of a\nhomogeneous isotropic universe, taking into consideration the centrifugal\nforces of repulsion. We propose a cosmological model of the universe, based on\nthese equations. This model apply to explain the observation data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 13:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}
