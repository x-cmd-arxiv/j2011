The\nreliable determination of the parameters strongly depends on the photometry\navailable and especially on the U filter, which is used to obtain the color\nexcess E(B-V) through the color-color diagram (U-B) by (B-V) by fitting a zero\nage main-sequence. Owing to the difficulty of performing photometry in the U\nband, many authors have tried to obtain E(B-V) without the filter. But because\nof the near linearity of the color-color diagrams that use the other bands,\ncombined with the fact that most fitting procedures are highly subjective (many\ndone \"by eye\") the reliability of those results has always been questioned. Our\ngroup has recently developed, a tool that performs isochrone fitting in\nopen-cluster photometric data with a global optimization algorithm, which\nremoves the need to visually perform the fits and thus removes most of the\nrelated subjectivity. Here we apply our method to a set of synthetic clusters\nand two observed open clusters (Trumpler 1 and Melotte 105) using only\nphotometry for the BVRI bands. Our results show that, considering the cluster\nstructural variance caused only by photometric and Poisson sampling errors, our\nmethod is able to recover the synthetic cluster parameters with errors of less\nthan 10% for a wide range of ages, distances, and reddening, which clearly\ndemonstrates its potential.

A simple threshold rule specifies\nwhether other agents switch subsequently. The cascade size (the percolation) is\nthe proportion of all agents which eventually switches to state 1.

Various ways are considered to extend the leptonic symmetries\nto the quark sector and to reconcile them with Grand Unification. In this\nconnection the quark-lepton complementarity could be a viable alternative to\nTBM. Observational consequences of the symmetries and future experimental tests\nof their existence are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 17:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Both theories from the dual pair support non-Abelian strings which\nconfine monopoles. Now we introduce an N=2-breaking deformation, a mass term\n\\mu{\\mathcal A}^2 for the adjoint fields. Starting from a small deformation we\neventually make it large which enforces complete decoupling of the adjoint\nfields. We show that the above non-Abelian duality fully survives in the limit\nof N=1 SQCD, albeit some technicalities change. For instance, non-Abelian\nstrings which used to be BPS-saturated in the N=2 limit, cease to be saturated\nin N=1 SQCD. Our duality is a distant relative of Seiberg's duality in N=1\nSQCD. Both share some common features but have drastic distinctions. This is\ndue to the fact that Seiberg's duality apply to the monopole rather than quark\nvacua.\n  More specifically, in our theory we deal with N< N_f<3/2 N massive quark\nflavors.

If comparing these models in discs with\nconditions which lead to a marginally inward migration, the small shift can\nlead to outward migration. However, the direction and speed of migration is\ndominated by disc conditions rather than by the specific prescription used to\nmodel the flow near the protoplanet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Not only is this the first SO\ncoupling realized in ultracold atomic gases, it is also the first ever for\nbosons. Furthermore, in the presence of the laser coupling, the interactions\nbetween the two dressed atomic spin states are modified, driving a quantum\nphase transition from a spatially spin-mixed state (lasers off) to a phase\nseparated state (above a critical laser intensity). The location of this\ntransition is in quantitative agreement with our theory.

Winds introduce a three-tier\nform for the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate functions, where the\nmiddle tier depends on differential (i.e. mass-dependent) recycling of ejected\nwind material back into galaxies. A tight M*-SFR relation is a generic outcome\nof all these simulations, and its evolution is well-described as being powered\nby cold accretion, although current observations at z>2 suggest that star\nformation in small early galaxies must be highly suppressed. Roughly one-third\nof z=0 galaxies at masses below M^* are satellites, and star formation in\nsatellites is not much burstier than in centrals. All models fail to suppress\nstar formation and stellar mass growth in massive galaxies at z<2, indicating\nthe need for an external quenching mechanism such as black hole feedback. All\nmodels also fail to produce dwarfs as young and rapidly star-forming as\nobserved.

To prove\nthis result we first describe a geometric way of writing the vacuum Einstein\nequations for the characteristic problems we are considering, in a gauge\ncharacterized by the introduction of a double null cone foliation of the\nspacetime. Then we prove that the existence region for the analytic solutions\ncan be extended to a larger region which depends only on the validity of the\napriori estimates for the Weyl equations, associated to the \"Bel-Robinson\nnorms\". In particular if the initial data are sufficiently small we show that\nthe analytic solution is global. Before showing how to extend the existence\nregion we describe the same result in the case of the Burger equation, which,\neven if much simpler, nevertheless requires analogous logical steps required\nfor the general proof. Due to length of this work, in this paper we mainly\nconcentrate on the definition of the gauge we use and on writing in a\n\"geometric\" way the Einstein equations, then we show how the Cauchy-Kowalevski\ntheorem is adapted to the characteristic problem for the Einstein equations and\nwe describe how the existence region can be extended in the case of the Burger\nequation. Finally we describe the structure of the extension proof in the case\nof the Einstein equations. The technical parts of this last result is the\ncontent of a second paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 23:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Furthermore, using the game's potential\nproperty, we derive a modified version of the replicator dynamics of\nevolutionary game theory which applies to this continuous game, and we show\nthat if the network's users employ a distributed learning scheme based on these\ndynamics, then they converge to equilibrium exponentially quickly. On the other\nhand, a major challenge occurs if the channels do not remain static but\nfluctuate stochastically over time, following a stationary ergodic process. In\nthat case, the associated ergodic game still admits a unique equilibrium, but\nthe learning analysis becomes much more complicated because the replicator\ndynamics are no longer deterministic. Nonetheless, by employing results from\nthe theory of stochastic approximation, we show that users still converge to\nthe game's unique equilibrium.\n  Our analysis hinges on a game-theoretical result which is of independent\ninterest: in finite player games which admit a (possibly nonlinear) convex\npotential function, the replicator dynamics (suitably modified to account for\nnonlinear payoffs) converge to an eps-neighborhood of an equilibrium at time of\norder O(log(1/eps)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 00:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 13:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

It was long\nknown that graphene mono and multilayers grow on SiC crystals at high\ntemperatures in ultra-high vacuum. At these temperatures, silicon sublimes from\nthe surface and the carbon rich surface layer transforms to graphene. However\nthe quality of the graphene produced in ultrahigh vacuum is poor due to the\nhigh sublimation rates at relatively low temperatures. The GT team developed\ngrowth methods involving encapsulating the SiC crystals in graphite enclosures,\nthereby sequestering the evaporated silicon and bringing growth process closer\nto equilibrium. In this confinement controlled sublimation (CCS) process, very\nhigh quality graphene is grown on both polar faces of the SiC crystals. Since\n2003, over 50 publications used CCS grown graphene, where it is known as the\n\"furnace grown\" graphene.

Motivated by new\nmeasurements of extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background radiation by\nFermi/LAT, we obtained upper limits placed on the UHECR emissivity in the\ndistant universe by requiring that the cascade radiation they produce not\nexceed the observed levels.

The\nrange of tensor indices can be extended dynamically without modifying the\ncomponent representation. This idea originates from a mathematical model of\nsemantic memory and a method known as random indexing in natural language\nprocessing. We generalize the random-indexing algorithm to tensors and present\nsignal-to-noise-ratio simulations for representations of vectors and matrices.\nWe present also a mathematical analysis of the approximate orthogonality of\nhigh-dimensional ternary vectors, which is a property that underpins this and\nother similar random-coding approaches to dimension reduction. To further\ndemonstrate the properties of random indexing we present results of a synonym\nidentification task.

This requirement is the condition of twisted self-duality.\nIt can be extended to p-forms in spacetime of D dimensions, and it survives the\nintroduction of a variety of couplings among forms of different rank, and also\nto spinor and scalar fields, which emerge naturally from supergravity. In this\npaper we provide a systematic derivation of the action principle, whose\nequations of motion are the condition of twisted self-duality. The derivation\nstarts from the standard Maxwell action, extended to include the aforementioned\ncouplings, and proceeds via the Hamiltonian formalism through the resolution of\nGauss' law. In the pure Maxwell case we recover in this way an action that had\nbeen postulated by other authors, through an ansatz based on an action given\nearlier by us for untwisted self-duality. Those authors also extended their\nansatz to include Chern-Simons couplings. In that case, we find a different\nresult. The derivation from the standard extended Maxwell action implies of\ncourse that the theory is Lorentz-invariant and can be locally coupled to\ngravity. Nevertherless we include a direct compact Hamiltonian proof of these\nproperties, which is based on the surface-deformation algebra.

The performance of a CCD\ndetector depends on its ability to transfer electrons through the silicon\nefficiently, so that the signal from every pixel may be read out through a\nsingle amplifier. This process of electron transfer is highly susceptible to\nthe effects of solar proton damage (or non-ionizing radiation damage). This is\nbecause charged particles passing through the CCD displace silicon atoms,\nintroducing energy levels into the semi-conductor bandgap which act as\nlocalized electron traps. The reduction in Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)\nleads to signal loss and image smearing.

In the\nliterature, these two strands are kept largely separate; both, however suffer\nfrom severe limitations. Laser cooling of atoms and molecules largely relies on\nthe internal level structure of the species being cooled. As a result, only a\nsmall number of elements and a tiny number of molecules can be cooled this way.\nIn the case of micromirrors, the problem lies in the engineering of\nmicromirrors that need to satisfy a large number of constraints---these include\na high mechanical Q-factor, high reflectivity and very good optical quality,\nweak coupling to the substrate, etc.---in order to enable efficient cooling.\nDuring the course of this thesis, I will draw these two sides of laser cooling\ncloser together by means of a single, generically applicable scattering theory\nthat can be used to explain the interaction between light and matter at a very\ngeneral level. I use this `transfer matrix' formalism to explore the use of the\nretarded dipole--dipole interaction as a means of both enhancing the efficiency\nof micromirror cooling systems and rendering the laser cooling of atoms and\nmolecules less species selective. In particular, I identify the `external\ncavity cooling' mechanism, whereby the use of an optical memory in the form of\na resonant element (such as a cavity), outside which the object to be cooled\nsits, can potentially lead to the construction of fully integrated\noptomechanical systems and even two-dimensional arrays of translationally cold\natoms, molecules or even micromirrors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 14:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 08:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

The class of\nconformal Killing symmetric tensor fields of an arbitrary rank is a natural\ngeneralization of the class of conformal Killing vector fields, and appears in\ndifferent geometric and physical problems. A symmetric tensor field is a\ntrace-free field if the contraction of the field with the metric tensor is\nidentically equal to zero. On a Riemannian manifold of dimension at least\nthree, the space of trace-free conformal Killing symmetric tensor fields of\narbitrary rank is of a finite dimension. On a two-dimensional manifold, the\nspace can be of infinite dimension. Nevertheless, on a connected manifold of\nany dimension, a trace-free conformal Killing tensor field is uniquely\ndetermined by its $C^\\infty$-jet at any point. We prove the statement: On a\nconnected manifold, a trace-free conformal Killing tensor field is identically\nequal to zero if it vanishes on some hypersurface. This statement is a basis of\nthe theorem on decomposition of a symmetric tensor field on a compact\nRiemannian manifold with boundary to a sum of three fields such that the first\nsummand is a trace-free and divergence-free field, the second summand is a\npotential field with a trace-free potential vanishing on the boundary, and the\nlast summand is a multiple of the metric tensor. The classical theorem by\nBochner - Yano states the absence of conformal Killing vector fields on a\nclosed manifold of negative Ricci curvature. We generalize the latter\nstatements to arbitrary rank tensor fields but under the stronger hypothesis:\nthe sectional curvature is assumed to be negative. There is no nontrivial\ntrace-free conformal Killing symmetric tensor field of any rank on a closed\nnegatively curved Riemannian manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 14:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-21"}

In the same period a radio-to-optical\nmonitoring of the source was provided by the GASP-WEBT and REM. Moreover,\nseveral Swift ToO observations were triggered, adding important information on\nthe source behaviour from optical/UV to hard X-rays. We paid particular\nattention to the calibration of the Swift/UVOT data to make it suitable to the\nblazars spectra. Simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed us\nto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at different\nfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. In the period 9-30 March\n2009, AGILE detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2\ns^-1 for E>100 MeV, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 on\ndaily integration. The gamma-ray activity occurred during a period of\nincreasing activity from near-IR to UV, with a flaring episode detected on\n26-27 March 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for the\nflux enhancement observed from near-IR to UV. By contrast, Swift/XRT\nobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the X-ray fluxes with the\noptical and gamma-ray ones. However, the X-ray observations show a harder\nphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most FSRQs and a hint of\nharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a second\nemission component at soft X-ray energies. Moreover, the broad band spectrum\nfrom radio-to-UV confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/UV\nspectrum of PKS 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. On the other hand,\nduring 25-26 March 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/UV energy band was\nobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission in\nthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore a\nsignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 15:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-16"}

In a large fraction (53%) of their spectra the\n[O III] emission line is detected, with an equivalent width (EW) distribution\nstrongly clustered around ~0.75 A. The vast majority of those RGEs for which it\nis possible to derive emission line ratios (amounting to about half of the\nsample) show values characteristic of LINERs. The close connection between\nemission lines and stellar continuum points to stellar processes as the most\nlikely source of the bulk of the ionizing photons in RGEs, rather than active\nnuclei. In particular, the observed EW and optical line ratios are consistent\nwith the predictions of models in which the photoionization comes from to hot\nevolved stars. Shocks driven by supernovae or stellar ejecta might also\ncontribute to the ionization budget. A minority, ~4%, of the galaxies show\nemission lines with an equivalent that is width a factor of ~2 greater than the\nsample median. Only among them are Seyfert-like spectra found. Furthermore, 40%\nof this subgroup have a radio counterpart, compared to ~6% of the rest of the\nsample. These characteristics argue in favor of an AGN origin for their\nemission lines. Emission lines diagnostic diagrams do not reveal a distinction\nbetween the AGN subset and the other members of the sample, and consequently\nthey are not a useful tool for establishing the dominant source of the ionizing\nphotons, which is better predicted by the EW of the emission lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 15:48:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Due to the rich chemical structure, the\nmultitude of physical process involved, and extensive radiative transfer\neffects, detailed modeling is needed to interpret the emission from this and\nother supernovae. In this paper, we analyze the late-time (~8 years) HST\nspectrum of the SN 1987A ejecta, where 44Ti is the dominant power source. Based\non an explosion model for a 19 Msun progenitor, we compute a model spectrum by\ncalculating the degradation of positrons and gamma-rays from the radioactive\ndecays, solving the equations governing temperature, ionization balance and\nNLTE level populations, and treating the radiative transfer with a Monte Carlo\ntechnique. We obtain a UV/optical/NIR model spectrum which is found to\nreproduce most of the lines in the observed spectrum to good accuracy. We find\nnon-local radiative transfer in atomic lines to be an important process also at\nthis late stage of the supernova, with ~30% of the emergent flux in the optical\nand NIR coming from scattering/fluorescence. We investigate the question of\nwhere the positrons deposit their energy, and favor the scenario where they are\nlocally trapped in the Fe/He clumps by a magnetic field. Energy deposition into\nthese largely neutral Fe/He clumps makes Fe I lines prominent in the emergent\nspectrum. Using the best available estimates for the dust extinction, we\ndetermine the amount of 44Ti produced in the explosion to 1.5\\pm0.5 * 10^-4\nMsun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 15:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 07:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 19:22:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 14:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In the former case, the time\nat which humans have emerged during the habitable period of the Earth suggests\na value of n = 4. Progressively adding earlier evolutionary transitions\n(Maynard Smith and Szathmary, 1995) gives an optimum fit when n = 5, implying\neither that their initial transitions are not critical or that habitability\nbegan around 6 Ga ago. The origin of life on Mars or elsewhere within the Solar\nSystem is excluded by the latter case and the simple anthropic argument is that\nextraterrestrial life is scarce in the Universe because it does not have time\nto evolve. Alternatively, the timescale can be extended if the migration of\nbasic progenotic material to Earth is possible. If extra transitions are\nincluded in the model to allow for Earth migration, then the start of\nhabitability needs to be even earlier than 6 Ga ago. Our present understanding\nof Galactic habitability and dynamics does not exclude this possibility. We\nconclude that Galactic punctuated equilibrium (Cirkovic et al. 2009), proposed\nas a way round the anthropic problem, is not the only way of making life more\ncommon in the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 17:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-22"}
