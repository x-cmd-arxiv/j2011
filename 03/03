The electron-hole exchange interaction Hamiltonian, which consists\nof the long- and short-range parts, is derived within the effective-mass\napproximation by taking into account the conduction, heavy- and light-hole\nbands, and especially the split-off band. The scheme applied in this work\nallows the description of excitons in both the strong and weak confinement\nregimes. The importance of treating the direct electron-hole Coulomb\ninteraction unperturbatively is demonstrated. We show in our calculation that\nthe light-hole and split-off bands are negligible when considering the exciton\nfine structure, even for GaN quantum dots, and the short-range exchange\ninteraction is irrelevant when considering the optically active doublet\nsplitting. We point out that the long-range exchange interaction, which is\nneglected in many previous works, contributes to the energy splitting between\nthe bright and dark states, together with the short-range exchange interaction.\nStrong dependence of the optically active doublet splitting on the anisotropy\nof dot shape is reported. Large doublet splittings up to 600 $\\mu$eV, and even\nup to several meV for small dot size with large anisotropy, is shown in GaN\nquantum dots. The spin relaxation between the lowest two optically active\nexciton states in GaN quantum dots is calculated, showing a strong dependence\non the dot anisotropy. Long exciton spin relaxation time is reported in GaN\nquantum dots. These findings are in good agreement with the experimental\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 16:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 09:28:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 16:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-15"}

The correct interpretation of these data requires a careful modelling of\npulsations in these magnetic stars. In light of this, in this work we present a\ntheoretical analysis of pulsations in roAp stars, taking into account the\ndirect influence of the magnetic field. We derive approximate analytical\nsolutions for the displacement components parallel and perpendicular to the\ndirection of the magnetic field, that are appropriate to the outermost layer.\nFrom these, we determine the expression for the theoretical radial velocity for\nan observer at a general position, and compute the corresponding pulsation\namplitude and phase as function of height in the atmosphere. We show that the\nintegral for the radial velocity has contributions from three different types\nof wave solutions, namely, running waves, evanescent waves, and standing waves\nof nearly constant amplitude. We then consider a number of case studies to\nillustrate the origin of the different pulsational behaviour that is found in\nthe observations. Concerning pulsation amplitude, we find that it generally\nincreases with atmospheric height. Pulsation phase, however, shows a diversity\nof behaviours, including phases that are constant, increasing, or decreasing\nwith atmospheric height. Finally, we show that there are situations in which\nthe pulsation amplitude goes through a zero, accompanied by a phase jumps of\n$\\pi$, and argue that such behaviour does not correspond to a pulsation node in\nthe outermost layers of the star, but rather to a visual effect, resulting from\nthe observers inability to resolve the stellar surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 16:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

No significant gamma-ray\nemission was found above the background. Differential upper limits on the\ngamma-ray flux are derived assuming various power-law slopes for the possible\nemission spectrum. Integral upper limits are also calculated for several\npower-law spectra and for different energy thresholds.

We found that in order to match the\nexperimental upper limits with the model predictions, a minimum flux boost of\n10^{3} is required, and that the upper limits are quite dependent on the shape\nof the gamma-ray energy spectrum predicted by each specific model. Finally we\ncompared the upper limits with the predictions of some dark matter models able\nto explain the PAMELA rise in the positron ratio, finding that Segue 1 data are\nin tension with the dark matter explanation of the PAMELA spectrum in the case\nof a dark matter candidate annihilating into tau+tau-.

The term environment has been used to\ndescribe a wide variety of measures that may or may not correlate with each\nother. Popular measures of environment include the distance to the N'th nearest\nneighbour, the number density of objects within some distance, or the mass of\nthe host dark matter halo. We use results from the Millennium simulation and a\nsemi-analytic model for galaxy formation to quantify the relations between\nenvironment and halo mass. We show that the environmental parameters used in\nthe observational literature are in effect measures of halo mass, even if they\nare measured for a fixed stellar mass. The strongest correlation between\nenvironment and halo mass arises when the number of objects is counted out to a\ndistance of 1.5-2 times the virial radius of the host halo and when the\ngalaxies/haloes are required to be relatively bright/massive. For observational\nstudies the virial radius is not easily determined, but the number of\nneighbours out to 1-2 Mpc/h gives a similarly strong correlation. For the\ndistance to the N'th nearest neighbour the correlation with halo mass is nearly\nas strong provided N>2. We demonstrate that this environmental parameter\nbecomes insensitive to halo mass if it is constructed from dimensionless\nquantities. This can be achieved by scaling the minimum luminosity/mass of\nneighbours to that of the object in question and by dividing the distance to a\nlength scale associated with either the neighbour or the galaxy under\nconsideration. We show how such a halo mass independent environmental parameter\ncan be defined for observational and numerical studies.

In the simplest case, negative feedback can be viewed as a\nsystem response that is `optimised' to minimise deviations from equilibrium,\nsuch that the system rapidly evolves towards a steady state. However, a general\nsolution of this form appears to be incompatible with radio observations which\nindicate intermittent AGN outbursts. Here, we explore an energetically\nfavourable scenario in which feedback is required to both balance X-ray gas\ncooling, and minimise the sum of the energy radiated by the gas and the energy\ninjected by the AGN. This specification is equivalent to ensuring that AGN\nheating balances the X-ray gas cooling with minimum black hole growth. It is\nshown that minimum energy heating occurs in discrete events, and not at a\ncontinuous, constant level. Furthermore, systems with stronger feedback\nexperience proportionally more powerful heating events, but correspondingly\nsmaller duty cycles. Interpreting observations from this perspective would\nimply that stronger feedback occurs in less massive objects - elliptical\ngalaxies, rather than galaxy clusters. One direct consequence of this effect\nwould be that AGN heating events are sufficiently powerful to expel hot gas\nfrom the gravitational potential of a galaxy, but not a galaxy cluster, which\nis consistent with theoretical explanations for the steepening of the L_X-T\nrelation at temperatures below 1-2 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-04"}

Written in terms of Kerr-Schild coordinates, the null\ngeodesic equation takes on the simple form of a particle moving under the\ninfluence of a Newtonian central force with an inverse-cubic potential. We\napply a McGehee transformation to these equations, which clearly elucidates the\nfull phase space of solutions. All the null geodesics belong to one of four\nfamilies of invariant manifolds and their limiting cases, further characterized\nby the angular momentum L of the orbit: for |L|>|L_c|, (1) the set that flow\noutward from the white hole, turn around, then fall into the black hole, (2)\nthe set that fall inward from past null infinity, turn around outside the black\nhole to continue to future null infinity, and for |L|<|L_c|, (3) the set that\nflow outward from the white hole and continue to future null infinity, (4) the\nset that flow inward from past null infinity and into the black hole. The\ncritical angular momentum Lc corresponds to the unstable circular orbit at\nr=3M, and the homoclinic orbits associated with it. There are two additional\ncritical points of the flow at the singularity at r=0. Though the solutions of\ngeodesic motion and Hamiltonian flow we describe here are well known, what we\nbelieve is a novel aspect of this work is the mapping between the two\nequivalent descriptions, and the different insights each approach can give to\nthe problem. For example, the McGehee picture points to a particularly\ninteresting limiting case of the class (1) that move from the white to black\nhole: in the limit as L goes to infinity, as described in Schwarzschild\ncoordinates, these geodesics begin at r=0, flow along t=constant lines, turn\naround at r=2M, then continue to r=0. During this motion they circle in azimuth\nexactly once, and complete the journey in zero affine time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 00:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The\ngermanium melt is more than twice as dense as liquid silicon, which could\ndestabilize a floating zone. Additionally, the lower melting point and the\nrelated lower radiative heat loss is shown to reduce the stability especially\nof the FZ process with the consequence of a screw-like crystal growth. We found\nthat the lower heat radiation of Ge can be compensated by the increased\nconvective cooling of a helium atmosphere instead of the argon ambient.

In addition to the two previously known cavities in the\ncluster core, the new and deeper X-ray image has revealed additional structure\nassociated with the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The surface brightness\ndecrements of the two cavities are unusually large, and are consistent with\nelongated cavities lying close to our line-of-sight. We estimate a total AGN\noutburst energy and mean jet power of $\\approx 3 - 6 \\times 10^{60}$ erg and\n$\\approx 3 - 6 \\times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively, depending on the\nassumed geometrical configuration of the cavities. Thus, RBS 797 is apparently\namong the the most powerful AGN outbursts known in a cluster. The average mass\naccretion rate needed to power the AGN by accretion alone is $\\sim 1 M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$. We show that accretion of cold gas onto the AGN at this level is\nplausible, but that Bondi accretion of the hot atmosphere is probably not.

From the Montague's point of view, the meaning of an idea can be\nconsidered as particular extensions in different possible worlds. In this paper\nwe analyze the minimal intensional semantic enrichment of the syntax of the FOL\nlanguage, by unification of different views: Tarskian extensional semantics of\nthe FOL, modal interpretation of quantifiers, and a derivation of the Tarskian\ntheory of truth from unified semantic theory based on a single meaning\nrelation. We show that not all modal predicate logics are intensional, and that\nan equivalent modal Kripke's interpretation of logic quantifiers in FOL results\nin a particular pure extensional modal predicate logic (as is the standard\nTarskian semantics of the FOL). This minimal intensional enrichment is obtained\nby adopting the theory of properties, relations and propositions (PRP) as the\nuniverse or domain of the FOL, composed by particulars and universals (or\nconcepts), with the two-step interpretation of the FOL that eliminates the weak\npoints of the Montague's intensional semantics.

In particular\nthe concepts of spatial material inhomogeneity and temporal non-stationarity\nare formulated within a fully covariant spacetime framework. This framework is\nillustrated by re-casting the Maxwell-Vlasov equations for a collisionless\nplasma in a form that exposes a 2-point electromagnetic susceptibility kernel\nin spacetime. This permits the establishment of a perturbative scheme for\nnon-stationary inhomogeneous plasma configurations.

Finally, we use the\nGALI method to elucidate further the connection between the dynamics of\nHamiltonian flows and symplectic maps. In particular, we show that, using for\nthe computation of GALIs the components of deviation vectors orthogonal to the\ndirection of motion, the indices of stable periodic orbits behave for flows as\nthey do for maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 14:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 12:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 10:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}

The spectrum can retain the shape of a Planck\nfunction or it can be broadened and have the shape of a Band function. This\nfact is best illustrated by studying GRB090902B: The main gamma-ray spectral\ncomponent is initially close to a Planck function, which can only be explained\nby emission from the jet photosphere. Later, the same component evolves into a\nbroader Band function. This burst thus provides observational evidence that the\nphotosphere can give rise to a non-thermal spectrum. We show that such a\nbroadening is most naturally explained by subphotospheric dissipation in the\njet. The broadening mainly depends on the strength and location of the\ndissipation, on the magnetic field strength, and on the relation between the\nenergy densities of thermal photons and of the electrons. We suggest that the\nevolution in spectral shape observed in GRB090902B is due to a decrease of the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the flow, leading to the main dissipation becoming\nsubphotospheric. Such a change in the flow parameters can also explain the\ncorrelation observed between the peak energy of the spectrum and low-energy\npower law slope, alpha, a correlation commonly observed in GRBs. We conclude\nthat photospheric emission could indeed be a ubiquitous feature during the\nprompt phase in GRBs and play a decisive role in creating the diverse spectral\nshapes and spectral evolutions that are observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 14:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We\ncompare the current approaches among each others with respect to some key\nrequirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 10:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-07"}

However, it was mired in\nadvanced mathematics. The formulation was strongly criticized by Max Planck,\nfor it was based on the analysis of adiabatic processes and adiabatic\naccessibility. A thermodynamic process is said to be possible only if it\nsatisfies both first law and the second law. A process is said to violate the\nsecond law only when it satisfies the first law, and violate the second law. We\nshow here that violation of Caratheodory principle of the second law violates\nthe first law itself. In other words, adiabatic inaccessibility arises only as\na consequence of violation of the first law. This we demonstrate by assuming,\nin contradiction to Caratheodory's principle, that the states considered\nadiabatically inaccessible as adiabatically accessible, and prove that the\nassumption leads to no paradox - thereby showing that the adiabatic\ninaccessibility arises as a result of violation of the first law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 19:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-23"}

The content of these two pieces serves to illustrate\nmany of the problems and has occasioned the construction of this answer to at\nleast some of them. The position of the axiom proposed by Carath\\'eodory is\ncentral in this matter and here its position is clarified and secured within\nthe framework of thermodynamics.
