Several\nrecent quantum dots experiments have shown that an electrostatic backgate could\nbe used to control the energy dispersion of magnetic levels. We discuss how the\ngenerically asymmetric coupling of the metallic contacts to two different\nmolecular orbitals can indeed lead to a gate-tunable Hund's rule in the\npresence of singlet and triplet states in the quantum dot. For gate voltages\nsuch that the singlet constitutes the (non-magnetic) ground state, one\ngenerally observes a suppression of low voltage transport, which can yet be\nrestored in the form of enhanced cotunneling features at finite bias. More\ninterestingly, when the gate voltage is controlled to obtain the triplet\nconfiguration, spin S=1 Kondo anomalies appear at zero-bias, with non-Fermi\nliquid features related to the underscreening of a spin larger than 1/2.\nFinally, the small bare singlet-triplet splitting in our device allows to\nfine-tune with the gate between these two magnetic configurations, leading to\nan unscreening quantum phase transition. This transition occurs between the\nnon-magnetic singlet phase, where a two-stage Kondo effect occurs, and the\ntriplet phase, where the partially compensated (underscreened) moment is akin\nto a magnetically \"ordered\" state. These observations are put theoretically\ninto a consistent global picture by using new Numerical Renormalization Group\nsimulations, taylored to capture sharp finie-voltage cotunneling features\nwithin the Coulomb diamonds, together with complementary out-of-equilibrium\ndiagrammatic calculations on the two-orbital Anderson model.

Objects with masses comparable to normal globular\nclusters (GCs) are called extended clusters (ECs), while objects with masses in\nthe dwarf galaxy regime are called ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). In\nheavily interacting galaxies star clusters tend to form in larger\nconglomerations called star cluster complexes (CCs). In this work we\nsystematically scan a suitable parameter space for CCs and perform numerical\nsimulations to study their further fate. The varied sizes and masses of the CCs\ncover a matrix of 5x6 values with CC Plummer radii between 10 - 160 pc and CC\nmasses between 10^5.5 - 10^8 M_sun, which are consistent with observed CC\nparameters. The CCs of the parametric study are on orbits with distances\nbetween 20 kpc and 60 kpc. In addition, we studied also the evolution of CCs on\na circular orbit at a distance of 60 kpc to verify that also extremely extended\nECs and UCDs can be explained by our formation scenario. All 54 simulations end\nup with stable merger objects, wherein 26 to 97% of the initial CC mass is\nbound. The objects show a general trend of increasing effective radii with\nincreasing mass. Despite the large range of input Plummer radii of the CCs (10\nto 160 pc) the effective radii of the merger objects are constrained to values\nbetween 10 and 20 pc at the low mass end and to values between 15 and 55 pc at\nthe high mass end. The structural parameters of the models are comparable to\nthose of the observed ECs and UCDs. The results of the circular orbits\ndemonstrate that even very extended objects like the M31 ECs found by Huxor in\n2005 and the very extended (r_eff > 80 pc), high-mass UCDs can be explained by\nmerged cluster complexes in regions with low gravitational fields at large\ndistances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We generalize this result to the more complete supernova problem,\nshowing explicitly that the same physics determines L_crit.

This\nhas inspired numerous generative models that match this property. However, more\nrecent work has shown that while these generative models do have the right\ndegree distribution, they are not good models for real life networks due to\ntheir differences on other important metrics like conductance. We believe this\nis, in part, because many of these real-world networks have very different\njoint degree distributions, i.e. the probability that a randomly selected edge\nwill be between nodes of degree k and l. Assortativity is a sufficient\nstatistic of the joint degree distribution, and it has been previously noted\nthat social networks tend to be assortative, while biological and technological\nnetworks tend to be disassortative.\n  We suggest understanding the relationship between network structure and the\njoint degree distribution of graphs is an interesting avenue of further\nresearch. An important tool for such studies are algorithms that can generate\nrandom instances of graphs with the same joint degree distribution. This is the\nmain topic of this paper and we study the problem from both a theoretical and\npractical perspective. We provide an algorithm for constructing simple graphs\nfrom a given joint degree distribution, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method\nfor sampling them. We also show that the state space of simple graphs with a\nfixed degree distribution is connected via end point switches. We empirically\nevaluate the mixing time of this Markov Chain by using experiments based on the\nautocorrelation of each edge. These experiments show that our Markov Chain\nmixes quickly on real graphs, allowing for utilization of our techniques in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 21:05:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 18:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-01"}

The observed\nhydrodynamical phenomenology is in agreement with original theoretical\npredictions based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, recently generalized to the\npolariton context. However, in contrast to this theoretical work, we show how\nthe initial position and the subsequent trajectory of the vortices crucially\ndepend on the strength and size of the artificial barrier. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate how a suitably tailored optical beam can be used to permanently\ntrap and store the vortices that are hydrodynamically created in the wake of a\nnatural defect. These observations are borne out by time-dependent theoretical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 00:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

The latter are characterized by the property that\nthe way the inflow at a non-destination node gets split among its outgoing\nlinks is allowed to depend only on local information about the current particle\ndensities on the outgoing links. The strong resilience of the network is\ndefined as the infimum sum of link-wise flow capacity reductions under which\nthe network cannot maintain the asymptotic total inflow to the destination node\nto be equal to the inflow at the origin. A class of distributed routing\npolicies that are locally responsive to local information is shown to yield the\nmaximum possible strong resilience under such local information constraints for\nan acyclic dynamical flow network with a single origin-destination pair. The\nmaximal strong resilience achievable is shown to be equal to the minimum node\nresidual capacity of the network.

Linear threshold functions and their various subclasses, such as\nconjunctions and decision lists, play a fundamental role in learning theory and\nhence their evolvability has been the primary focus of research on Valiant's\nframework (2007). One of the main open problems regarding the model is whether\nconjunctions are evolvable distribution-independently (Feldman and Valiant,\n2008). We show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on a new\ncombinatorial parameter of a concept class that lower-bounds the complexity of\nlearning from correlations.\n  We contrast the lower bound with a proof that linear threshold functions\nhaving a non-negligible margin on the data points are evolvable\ndistribution-independently via a simple mutation algorithm.

During the evolution, the disky dwarfs undergo strong mass loss,\nthe stellar disks are transformed into spheroids, and rotation is replaced by\nrandom motions of the stars. Thus, the late-type progenitors are transformed\ninto early-type dwarfs as envisioned by the tidal stirring model for the\nformation of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the Local Group. We determine\nthe photometric properties of the dwarfs, including the total visual magnitude,\nthe half-light radius and the central surface brightness as they would be\nmeasured by an observer near the galactic center. Special emphasis is also\nplaced on studying their kinematics and shapes. We demonstrate that the\nmeasured values are biased by a number of observational effects including the\nincreasing angle of the observation cone near the orbital pericenter, the fact\nthat away from the pericenter the tidal tails are typically oriented along the\nline of sight, and the fact that for most of the evolution the stellar\ncomponents of the dwarfs are triaxial ellipsoids whose major axis tumbles with\nrespect to the line of sight. Finally, we compare the measured properties of\nthe simulated dwarfs to those of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. The\nevolutionary tracks of the dwarfs in different parameter planes and the\ncorrelations between their different properties, especially the total magnitude\nand the surface brightness, strongly suggest that present-day dSph galaxies may\nhave indeed formed from late-type progenitors as proposed by the tidal stirring\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 06:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2011 14:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The aim is to examine\nwhether or not resonant trapping can occur and be maintained in presence of\nturbulence and how this depends on the amplitude of the stochastic density\nfluctuations in the disk. We have performed 2D numerical simulations using a\ngrid-based hydrodynamical code in which turbulence is modelled as stochastic\nforcing. We assume that the outermost planet is initially located just outside\nthe position of the 3:2 mean motion resonance (MMR) with the inner one and we\nstudy the dependance of the resonance stability with the amplitude of the\nstochastic forcing. For systems of two equal-mass planets we find that in disk\nmodels with an effective viscous stress parameter {\\alpha} 10^{-3}, damping\neffects due to type I migration can counteract the effects of diffusion of the\nresonant angles, in such a way that the 3:2 MMR can possibly remain stable over\nthe disk lifetime. For systems of super-Earths with mass ratio q=m_i/m_o < 1/2,\nwhere m_i (m_o) is the mass of the innermost (outermost) planet, the 3:2 MMR is\nbroken in turbulent disks with effective viscous stresses 2x10^{-4}< {\\alpha}<\n10^{-3} but the planets become locked in stronger p+1:p resonances, with p\nincreasing as the value for {\\alpha} increases. For {\\alpha}> 2x10^{-3}, the\nevolution can eventually involve temporary capture in a 8:7 commensurability\nbut no stable MMR is formed. Our results suggest that for values of the viscous\nstress parameter typical to those generated by MHD turbulence, MMRs between two\nsuper-Earths are likely to be disrupted by stochastic density fluctuations.

It is\neven discussed as an imprint of the formation history of discs and the\nevolution of baryons in dark matter haloes. Here, we analyse a selected sample\nof 70 galaxies from the Westerbork HI Survey of Spiral and Irregular Galaxies.\nThe HI data allow us to follow the morphology and the kinematics out to very\nlarge radii. In the present paper, we present the rotation curves and study the\nkinematic asymmetry. We extract the rotation curves of receding and approaching\nsides separately and show that the kinematic behaviour of disc galaxies can be\nclassified by five different types: symmetric velocity fields where the\nrotation curves of receding and approaching sides are almost identical; global\ndistortions where the rotation velocities of receding and approaching side have\nan offset which is constant with radius; local distortions which lead to large\ndeviations in the inner and negligible deviations in the outer parts (and vice\nversa); and distortions which split the galaxies into two kinematic systems,\nvisible in the different behaviour of the rotation curves of receding and\napproaching sides, which leads to a crossing and a change in side. The\nkinematic lopsidedness is measured from the maximum rotation velocities,\naveraged over the plateau of the rotation curves. This gives a good estimate of\nglobal lopsidedness in the outer parts of the sample galaxies. We find that the\nmean value of the perturbation parameter denoting the lopsided potential as\nobtained from the kinematic data is 0.056. 36% of all sample galaxies are\nglobally lopsided, which can be interpreted as the disc responding to a halo\nthat was distorted by a tidal encounter.

This\nso-called lopsidedness is expected to significantly affect the dynamics and\nevolution of the disc, including the star formation activity. Here, we measure\nthe degree of lopsidedness for the gas distribution in a selected sample of 70\ngalaxies from the Westerbork HI Survey of Spiral and Irregular Galaxies. This\ncomplements our earlier work (Paper I) where the kinematic lopsidedness was\nderived for the same galaxies. The morphological lopsidedness is measured by\nperforming a harmonic decomposition of the surface density maps. The amplitude\nof lopsidedness A_1, the fractional value of the first Fourier component, is\ntypically quite high (about 0.1) within the optical disc and has a constant\nphase. Thus, lopsidedness is a common feature in galaxies and indicates a\nglobal mode. We measure A_1 out to typically one to four optical radii,\nsometimes even further. This is, on average, four times larger than the\ndistance to which lopsidedness was measured in the past using near-IR as a\ntracer for the old stellar component, and will therefore provide a new, more\nstringent constraint on the mechanism for the origin of lopsidedness.\nInterestingly, the value of A_1 saturates beyond the optical radius.\nFurthermore, the plot of A_1 vs. radius shows fluctuations which we argue are\ndue to local spiral features. We also try to explain the physical origin of\nthis observed disc lopsidedness. No clear trend is found when the degree of\nlopsidedness is compared to a measure of the isolation or interaction\nprobability of the sample galaxies. However, this does not rule out a tidal\norigin if the lopsidedness is long-lived. Additionally, we find that the\nearly-type galaxies tend to be more morphologically lopsided than late-type\ngalaxies. Both results together indicate a tidal origin for the lopsidedness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 08:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Firstly, the Anderson transition is studied\nfor the BCC and FCC lattices. We obtain high precision results for the critical\ndisorder at the band centre and the critical exponent. Comparing the critical\ndisorder between the SC, BCC and FCC lattices, an increase is observed as a\nfunction of the coordination number of the lattice. The critical exponent is\nfound to be approximately 1.5 in agreement with the value for the SC lattice.\nEnergy-disorder phase diagrams are plotted for both lattice types. Next, we\nconsider the Aharonov-Bohm effect for an exciton in a 1D ring. The aim is to\ndetermine how the addition of a constant electric field in the plane of the\nring affects the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. We observe an inversion of the\noscillations in the oscillator strength at a critical electric field, with the\noscillation minimum reaching zero at half a magnetic flux quantum.

We present a physically consistent reconstruction of the total solar\nirradiance for the Holocene. Methods. We extend the SATIRE models to estimate\nthe evolution of the total (and partly spectral) solar irradiance over the\nHolocene. The basic assumption is that the variations of the solar irradiance\nare due to the evolution of the dark and bright magnetic features on the solar\nsurface. The evolution of the decadally averaged magnetic flux is computed from\ndecadal values of cosmogenic isotope concentrations recorded in natural\narchives employing a series of physics-based models connecting the processes\nfrom the modulation of the cosmic ray flux in the heliosphere to their record\nin natural archives. We then compute the total solar irradiance (TSI) as a\nlinear combination of the jth and jth + 1 decadal values of the open magnetic\nflux. Results. Reconstructions of the TSI over the Holocene, each valid for a\ndi_erent paleomagnetic time series, are presented. Our analysis suggests that\nmajor sources of uncertainty in the TSI in this model are the heritage of the\nuncertainty of the TSI since 1610 reconstructed from sunspot data and the\nuncertainty of the evolution of the Earth's magnetic dipole moment. The\nanalysis of the distribution functions of the reconstructed irradiance for the\nlast 3000 years indicates that the estimates based on the virtual axial dipole\nmoment are significantly lower at earlier times than the reconstructions based\non the virtual dipole moment. Conclusions. We present the first physics-based\nreconstruction of the total solar irradiance over the Holocene, which will be\nof interest for studies of climate change over the last 11500 years.

In\npractice, to hedge a contingent claim one typically uses the so-called\ndelta-hedging strategy. This strategy stems from the Black--Merton--Scholes\nmodel where it perfectly replicates contingent claims. From the theoretical\nviewpoint, there is no reason for this to hold in models with jumps. However in\npractice the delta-hedging strategy is widely used and its potential\nshortcoming in models with jumps is disregarded since such models are typically\nincomplete and hence most contingent claims are non-attainable. In this note we\ninvestigate a complete model with jumps where the delta-hedging strategy is\nwell-defined for regular payoff functions and is uniquely determined via the\nrisk-neutral measure. In this setting we give examples of (admissible)\ndelta-hedging strategies with bounded discounted value processes, which\nnevertheless fail to replicate the respective bounded contingent claims. This\ndemonstrates that the deficiency of the delta-hedging strategy in the presence\nof jumps is not due to the incompleteness of the model but is inherent in the\ndiscontinuity of the trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 13:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-29"}

The synchronized solutions are\ncharacterized by an integer $m$, the winding number, and a second integer $l$.\nSynchronized solutions of type ($m$, $l=0$) are all stable, and an explicit\nperturbative expression for these for large values of the coupling constant $K$\nis presented. For low $K$, these solutions appear at certain specific values,\neach merging with a solution of type ($m$, $l=1$), both these solutions being\nstable for $K$ close to the relevant value. The ($m$, 0) solution continues to\nbe stable for larger $K$, while the ($m$, 1) solution, on continuation in $K$\nbecomes unstable and then merges with a new type (with a different $m$ and l)\nof unstable solution. The ($m$,0) type solutions for large $K$ are in the\nnature of phase waves traveling round the ring. All the stable synchronized\nsolutions are entrained by an external periodic driving, provided that the\ndriving frequency is sufficiently close to the frequency of the synchronized\npopulation. A perturbative approach is outlined for the construction of the\nentrained solutions. For a given amplitude of driving, there is a certain\nmaximum detuning between the two up to which the entrained solution persists.\nThe question of stability of the entrained solution is addressed. The simplest\nsituation involving three oscillators is investigated in details where the\nonset of synchronization is seen to occur through a tangent bifurcation at some\ncritical value of $K$. Immediately before the appearance of the first\nsynchronized solution, the system exhibits intermittent chaos with a typical\nscaling for the duration of the laminar phase. Under a periodic driving with an\nappropriately limited detuning, there occurs entrainment of the chaotic\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 13:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 14:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-31"}

The answer is vital for\nunderstanding neutron star formation in core collapse supernovae. Furthermore,\nthis system raises interesting issues about the nature of the progenitor binary\nand how it evolved during its mass exchanging X-ray phase. In this paper we\ndiscuss the progenitor evolution of PSR J1614-2230. We have performed detailed\nstellar evolution modelling of intermediate-mass X-ray binaries undergoing Case\nA Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) and applied an analytic parameterization for\ncalculating the outcome of either a common envelope evolution or the highly\nsuper-Eddington isotropic re-emission mode. We find two viable possibilities\nfor the formation of the PSR J1614-2230 system: either it contained a 2.2-2.6\nM_sun giant donor star and evolved through a common envelope and spiral-in\nphase or, more likely, it descended from a close binary system with a 4.0-5.0\nM_sun main sequence donor star via Case A RLO. We conclude that the neutron\nstar must have been born with a mass of ~1.95 M_sun or 1.7+-0.15 M_sun,\nrespectively - which significantly exceeds neutron star birth masses in\npreviously discovered radio pulsar systems. Based on the expected neutron star\nbirth masses from considerations of stellar evolution and explosion models, we\nfind that the progenitor star of PSR J1614-2230 is likely to have been more\nmassive than 20 M_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 15:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 10:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
