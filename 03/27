The shape of the degeneracy between WIMP mass and cross\nsections and their offset from the true values of those parameters depends on\nthe hypothesis for the speed distribution, which has significant implications\nfor consistency checks between direct-detection and collider data.

We propose an approach exploiting the parsimonious time-frequency\nrepresentation of the signal by applying a new OMP-type algorithm for\nstructured sparsity patterns. An important issue is the scalability of the\nproposed algorithm since high-dimensional models shall be used for radar\nsignals. Monte-Carlo simulations for modulated signals illustrate the good\nperformance of the method even for low signal-to-noise ratios and a gain of 20\ndB for the DOA estimation compared to some elementary method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2011 20:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-30"}

We\nuse a connection with the standard map in order to find the position of the\nfirst invariant spanning curve which borders the chaotic sea. We find that the\nposition of the first invariant spanning curve increases as a power of the\ncontrol parameter with the exponent 2/3. The standard deviation of the kinetic\nenergy of an ensemble of initial conditions obeys a power law as a function of\ntime, and saturates after some crossover. Scaling formalism is used in order to\ncharacterize the chaotic region close to the transition from integrability to\nnonintegrability and a relationship between the power law exponents is derived.\nThe formalism can be applied in many different systems with mixed phase space.\nThen, dissipation is introduced into the model and therefore the property of\narea preservation is broken, and consequently attractors are observed. We show\nthat after a small change of the dissipation, the chaotic attractor as well as\nits basin of attraction are destroyed, thus leading the system to experience a\nboundary crisis. The transient after the crisis follows a power law with\nexponent -2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2011 00:05:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 13:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 20:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-14"}

At present what makes\nthe fast wind fast and the slow wind slow still remains to be answered. While a\nrobust empirical correlation exists between the coronal expansion rate $f_c$ of\nthe flow tubes and the speeds $v$ measured in situ, further data analysis\nsuggests that $v$ depends on more than just $f_c$. We examine whether the\nnon-radial shape of field lines, which naturally accompanies any non-radial\nexpansion, could be an additional geometrical factor. We solved the transport\nequations incorporating the heating due to turbulent Alfv\\'en waves for an\nelectron-proton solar wind along curved field lines given by an analytical\nmagnetic field model, representative of a solar minimum corona. The field line\nshape is found to influence substantially the solar wind parameters, reducing\nthe asymptotic speed by up to $\\sim 130$ km s$^{-1}$, or by $\\sim 28%$ in\nrelative terms, compared with the case neglecting the field line curvature.\nThis effect was interpreted in the general framework of energy addition in the\nsolar wind: Relative to the straight case, the field line curvature enhances\nthe effective energy deposition to the subsonic flow, resulting in a higher\nproton flux and a lower terminal proton speed. Our computations suggest that\nthe field line curvature could be a geometrical factor which, in addition to\nthe tube expansion, substantially influences the solar wind speed. Furthermore,\nat solar minima although the field line curvature unlikely affects the polar\nfast solar wind, it does help make the wind at low latitudes slow, thereby\nhelping better reproduce the Ulysses measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2011 13:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Such a result is a straightforward\nconsequence of the second principle of thermodynamics. Recent advances in the\nstudy of the thermodynamics of long-range interacting system report however on\na rather intricate zoology of peculiar behaviors, which are occasionally in\ncontrast with customarily accepted scenarios, dueling with intuition and common\nsense. In this paper, a thermodynamical cycle is assembled for an ideal device\nworking with non-Boltzmaniann long-range fluid and operating in contact with\ntwo thermal reservoirs. The system is analytically shown to violate the second\nprinciple of thermodynamics, a phenomenon that ultimately relates to the\nexistence of regions with negative kinetic specific heat, in the canonical\nensemble for the system under scrutiny. We argue that the validity of the\nsecond principle of thermodynamics can be possibly restored, by revisiting the\ndefinition of canonical ensemble, as well as the Fourier law of heat transport,\nand consequently relaxing the constraint on the maximal efficiency as imposed\nby the Carnot theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2011 15:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-29"}
