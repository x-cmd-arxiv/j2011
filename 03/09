By including these contributions, which are distinct\nfrom conventional superexchange in Mott-insulators, we obtain a quantitative\nsatisfying theoretical description of the magnetic susceptibility data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 18:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-22"}

The time\nevolution of a particle distribution initially not equal to the absolute square\nof the wave function is calculated for a particle in a two-dimensional infinite\npotential square well. Under the de Broglie-Bohm ontology, the box contains an\nobjectively-existing 'pilot wave' which guides the electron trajectory, and\nthis is represented mathematically by a Schroedinger wave function composed of\na finite out-of-phase superposition of M energy eigenstates (with M ranging\nfrom 4 to 64). The electron density distributions are found to evolve naturally\ninto the Born-rule ones and stay there; in analogy with the classical case this\nrepresents a decay to 'quantum equilibrium'. The proximity to equilibrium is\ncharacterized by the coarse-grained subquantum H-function which is found to\ndecrease roughly exponentially towards zero over the course of time. The\ntimescale tau for this relaxation is calculated for various values of M and the\ncoarse-graining length epsilon. Its dependence on M is found to disagree with\nan earlier theoretical prediction. A power law - tau inversely proportional to\nM - is found to be fairly robust for all coarse-graining lengths and, although\na weak dependence of tau on epsilon is observed, it does not appear to follow\nany straightforward scaling. A theoretical analysis is presented to explain\nthese results. This improvement in our understanding of timescales for\nrelaxation to quantum equilibrium is likely to be of use in the development of\nmodels of relaxation in the early universe, with a view to constraining\npossible violations of the Born rule in inflationary cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 18:17:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 16:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

They offer an excellent\nlaboratory to study close and wide binary systems, and to scrutinize their\ninteriors through asteroseismology, as some of them undergo stellar\noscillations. However, their origins are still uncertain, and increasing the\nnumber of detections is crucial to undertake statistical studies. In this work,\nwe aim at defining a strategy to find new, uncatalogued hot subdwarfs. Making\nuse of Virtual Observatory tools we thoroughly search stellar catalogues to\nretrieve multi-colour photometry and astrometric information of a known sample\nof blue objects, including hot subdwarfs, white dwarfs, cataclysmic variables\nand main sequence OB stars. We define a procedure to discriminate among these\nspectral classes, particularly designed to obtain a hot subdwarf sample with a\nlow contamination factor. In order to check the validity of the method, this\nprocedure is then applied to two test sky regions: the Kepler FoV and to a test\nregion of around (RA:225, DEC:5) deg. As a result, we obtained 38 hot subdwarf\ncandidates, 23 of which had already a spectral classification. We have acquired\nspectroscopy for three other targets, and four additional ones have an\navailable SDSS spectrum, which we used to determine their spectral type. A\ntemperature estimate is provided for the candidates based on their spectral\nenergy distribution, considering two-atmospheres fit for objects with clear\ninfrared excess. Eventually, out of 30 candidates with spectral classification,\n26 objects were confirmed to be hot subdwarfs, yielding a contamination factor\nof only 13%. The high rate of success demonstrates the validity of the proposed\nstrategy to find new uncatalogued hot subdwarfs. An application of this method\nto the entire sky will be presented in a forthcoming work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 18:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

All spectral models require at least two diffuse thermal plasma\ncomponents to achieve adequate spectral fits, a softer component with kT =\n0.2--0.6 keV and a harder component with kT = 0.5--0.9 keV. In several cases\nthese hot plasmas appear to be in a state of non-equilibrium ionization that\nmay indicate recent and current strong shocks. A cavity north of the embedded\ngiant HII region NGC 3576 is the only region studied here that exhibits hard\ndiffuse X-ray emission; this emission appears to be nonthermal and is likely\ndue to a recent cavity supernova, as evidenced by a previously-known pulsar and\nnewly-discovered pulsar wind nebula also seen in this cavity. All of these\ntargets exhibit X-ray emission lines that are not well-modeled by\nvariable-abundance thermal plasmas and that might be attributed to charge\nexchange at the shock between the hot, tenuous, X-ray-emitting plasma and cold,\ndense molecular material; this is likely evidence for dust destruction at the\nmany hot/cold interfaces that characterize massive star-forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 19:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

These fundamental plane relations have been subject of several\nstudies, which have been mostly confined to certain types of galaxies and/or\nstar clusters so far. Here, we present a complete picture of hot stellar\nsystems ranging from faint galaxies and star clusters of only a few hundred\nsolar masses up to giant ellipticals (gEs) with 10^12 M_sun, in particular\nincluding large samples of compact ellipticals (cEs), ultra-compact dwarf\ngalaxies (UCDs), dwarf ellipticals (dEs) of nearby galaxy clusters and Local\nGroup ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals (dSphs).

Two families of hot stellar\nsystems can be differentiated: the 'galaxian' family, ranging from gEs over Es\nand dEs to dSphs, and the 'star cluster' family, comprising globular clusters\n(GCs), UCDs and nuclear star clusters (NCs). Interestingly, massive ellipticals\nhave a similar size-mass relation as cEs, UCDs and NCs, with a clear common\nboundary towards minimum sizes. No object of either family is located in the\n'zone of avoidance' beyond this limit. Even the majority of early-type galaxies\nat high redshift obeys this relation. The sizes of dEs and dSphs as well as GCs\nbarely vary with mass over several orders of magnitude. We use the constant\ngalaxy sizes to derive the distances of several local galaxy clusters.

This early stage occurs much before the dispersal of most of the\ngas from the protoplanetary disk. Due to their different aerodynamic\nproperties, planetesimals of different sizes and shapes experience different\ndrag forces from the gas during this time. Such differential forces produce a\nwind-shearing (WISH) effect between close by, different size planetesimals. For\nany two planetesimals, a WISH radius can be considered, at which the\ndifferential acceleration due to the wind becomes greater than the mutual\ngravitational pull between the planetesimals. We find that the WISH radius\ncould be much smaller than the Hill radius, i.e. WISH could play a more\nimportant role than tidal perturbations by the star. Here we study the WISH\nradii for planetesimal pairs of different sizes and compare the effects of wind\nand gravitational shearing (drag force vs. gravitational tidal force). We then\ndiscuss the role of WISH for the stability and survival of binary\nplanetesimals. Binaries are sheared apart by the wind if they are wider than\ntheir WISH radius. WISH-stable binaries can inspiral and possibly coalesce due\nto gas drag. Here, we calculate the WISH radius and the gas drag-induced merger\ntimescale, providing stability and survival criteria for gas-embedded binary\nplanetesimals. Our results suggest that even WISH-stable binaries may merge in\ntimes shorter than the lifetime of the gaseous disk. This may constrain\ncurrently observed binary planetesimals to have formed far from the star or at\na late stage after the dispersal of most of the disk gas. We note that the WISH\nradius may also be important for other processes such as planetesimal erosion\nand planetesimal encounters and collisions in a gaseous environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2011 05:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Using toy cluster models as well as ray-tracing through\nN-body simulations of structure formation along with semi-analytic galaxy\nformation models, we test the method and assess its performance. Results: We\nshow that with the proposed method, one can recover the density profiles of the\ncluster galaxy halos in the range 30 - 300 kpc. Using the method, we find that\nweak-lensing signal of cluster member galaxies in the Millennium Simulation is\nwell described by an Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. In contrast,\nnon-singular isothermal mass distribution (like PIEMD) model provide a poor\nfit. Furthermore, we do not find evidence for a sharp truncation of the galaxy\nhalos in the range probed by our method. Instead, there is an observed overall\ndecrease of the halo mass profile of cluster member galaxies with increasing\ntime spent in the cluster. This trend, as well as the presence or absence of a\ntruncation radius, should be detectable in future weak-lensing surveys like the\nDark Energy Survey (DES) or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) survey.\nSuch surveys should also allow one to infer the mass-luminosity relation of\ncluster galaxies with our method over two decades in mass.

We consider a set of eight\nparameters, six of which are commonly used to characterize dark matter halo\nproperties: mass, concentration, spin, shape, overdensity, and the angle\n($\\Phi_L$) between the major axis and the angular momentum vector. Two\nadditional parameters ($\\x_{off}$ and $\\rho_{rms}$) are used to describe the\ndegree of `relaxedness' of the halo. We find that we can account for much of\nthe variance of these properties with halo mass and concentration, on the one\nhand, and halo relaxedness on the other. Nonetheless, three principle\ncomponents are usually required to account for most of the variance. We argue\nthat halo mass is not as dominant as expected, which is a challenge for halo\noccupation models and semi-analytic models that assume that mass determines\nother halo (and galaxy) properties. In addition, we find that the angle\n$\\Phi_L$ is not significantly correlated with other halo parameters, which may\npresent a difficulty for models in which galaxy disks are oriented in haloes in\na particular way. Finally, at fixed mass, we find that a halo's environment\n(quantified by the large-scale overdensity) is relatively unimportant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 21:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 17:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Using the IRAM 30m telescope, we measure the CO(1-0) line in a sample\nof ~350 nearby (D=100-200 Mpc), massive galaxies (log(M*/Msun)>10.0). The\nsample is selected purely according to stellar mass, and therefore provides an\nunbiased view of molecular gas in these systems. By combining the IRAM data\nwith SDSS photometry and spectroscopy, GALEX imaging and high-quality Arecibo\nHI data, we investigate the partition of condensed baryons between stars,\natomic gas and molecular gas in 0.1-10L* galaxies. In this paper, we present CO\nluminosities and molecular hydrogen masses for the first 222 galaxies. The\noverall CO detection rate is 54%, but our survey also uncovers the existence of\nsharp thresholds in galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surface\ndensity and concentration index, below which all galaxies have a measurable\ncold gas component but above which the detection rate of the CO line drops\nsuddenly. The mean molecular gas fraction MH2/M* of the CO detections is\n0.066+/-0.039, and this fraction does not depend on stellar mass, but is a\nstrong function of NUV-r colour. Through stacking, we set a firm upper limit of\nMH2/M*=0.0016+/-0.0005 for red galaxies with NUV-r>5.0. The average\nmolecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio in present-day galaxies is 0.3, with\nsignificant scatter from one galaxy to the next. The existence of strong\ndetection thresholds in both the HI and CO lines suggests that \"quenching\"\nprocesses have occurred in these systems. Intriguingly, atomic gas strongly\ndominates in the minority of galaxies with significant cold gas that lie above\nthese thresholds. This suggests that some re-accretion of gas may still be\npossible following the quenching event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 21:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-12"}

We analyze the\nentire sample of galaxies where black hole mass, velocity dispersion, sigma,\nand asymptotic circular velocity, Vc, have all been measured. We fit M-sigma\nand M-Vc to a power law, and find that in both relationships the scatter and\nslope are similar. This model-independent analysis suggests that although the\nblack hole masses are not uniquely determined by dark matter halo mass, when\nconsidered for the current sample as a whole, the M-Vc correlation may be as\nstrong (or as weak) as M-sigma. Although the data are sparse, there appears to\nbe more scatter in the correlation for both sigma and Vc at the low--mass end.\nThis is not unexpected given our current understanding of galaxy and black hole\nassembly. In fact, there are several compelling reasons that account for this:\n(i) SMBH formation is likely less efficient in low-mass galaxies with large\nangular momentum content; (ii) SMBH growth is less efficient in low-mass disk\ngalaxies that have not experienced major mergers; (iii) dynamical effects, such\nas gravitational recoil, increase scatter preferentially at the low-mass end.\nTherefore, the recent observational claim of the absence of central SMBHs in\nbulgeless, low mass galaxies, or deviations from the correlations defined by\nhigh-mass black holes in large galaxies today is, in fact, predicated by\ncurrent models of black hole growth. We show how this arises as a direct\nconsequence of the coupling between dark matter halos and central black holes\nat the earliest epochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 21:10:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 13:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In order to investigate the nature of Li-rich\ngiants, we searched this database for giants presenting a strong Li\\,I\nresonance line. Methods: We performed a chemical abundance analysis on the\nselected stars with the MOOG code along with proper ATLAS-9 model atmospheres.\nThe iron content and atmospheric parameters were fixed by using the equivalent\nwidth of a sample of Fe lines. We also derive abundances for C, N, and O and\nmeasure or derive lower limits on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios, which\nis a sensible diagnostic of the stars evolutionary status. Results: We detected\nfive stars with a lithium abundance higher than 1.5, i.e. Li-rich according to\nthe current definition. One of them (SPM-313132) has A(Li)$>$3.3 and, because\nof this, belongs to the group of the rare super Li-rich giants. Its kinematics\nmakes it a likely thin-disk member and its atmospheric parameters are\ncompatible with it being a 4\\,M$_\\odot$ star either on the red giant branch\n(RGB) or the early asymptotic giant branch. This object is the first super\nLi-rich giant detected at this phase. The other four are likely low-mass\nthick-disk stars evolved past the RGB luminosity bump, as determined from their\nmetallicities and atmospheric parameters. The most evolved of them lies close\nto the RGB-tip. It has A(Li)$>$2.7 and a low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio,\nclose to the cool bottom processing predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 22:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

However, galaxy mergers are only one type of major dynamical\ninteraction between halos -- another class of encounter, a close flyby, has\nbeen largely ignored. We use cosmological N-body simulations to reconstruct the\nentire dynamical interaction history of dark matter halos. We present a careful\nmethod of identifying and tracking a dark matter halo which resolves the\ntypical classes of anomalies that occur in N-body data. This technique allows\nus to robustly follow halos and several hierarchical levels of subhalos as they\ngrow, dissolve, merge, and flyby one another -- thereby constructing both a\ncensus of the dynamical interactions in a volume and an archive of the\ndynamical evolution of an individual halo. In addition to a census of mergers,\nour tool characterizes the frequency of close flyby interactions in the\nUniverse. We find that the number of close flyby interactions is comparable to,\nor even surpasses, the number of mergers for halo masses $\\gtrsim\n10^{11}\\,\\Msun$ at $z \\lesssim 2$. Halo flybys occur so frequently to high mass\nhalos that they are continually perturbed, unable to reach a dynamical\nequilibrium. In particular, we find that Milky Way type halos undergo a similar\nnumber of flybys as mergers irrespective of mass-ratio for $z\\lesssim 2$. We\nalso find tentative evidence that at high redshift, $z \\gtrsim 14$, flybys are\nas frequent as mergers. Our results suggest that close halo flybys can play an\nimportant role in the evolution of the earliest dark matter halos and their\ngalaxies, and can still influence galaxy evolution at the present epoch.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 00:43:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 13:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

One\nobject appears to have a small companion that may be involved in an ongoing\nminor merger of the sort that could be responsible for building up the outer\nparts of these galaxies. The ages of the dominant stellar populations in these\nobjects are found to be around 2--4 Gyr, in good agreement with the previous\nestimates. The presence of diffuse outer structures in these galaxies indicates\nthat truly compact and massive red galaxies are exceedingly rare at low\nredshift.

When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers,\nradioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern. In order\nto control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique\nthat uses composite macro-bolometers to identify energy depositions that occur\nclose to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector. The\ncomposite macro-bolometer proposed and studied here consists of a main energy\nabsorber that is thermally coupled to and entirely surrounded by thin absorbers\nthat act as active shields. Surface energy depositions can be rejected by the\nanalysis of simultaneous signals in the main absorber and the shields. In this\npaper, we describe a full thermal model and experimental results for three\nprototype detectors. The detectors consist of Ge, Si, or TeO2 thin absorbers as\nactive shields, all with TeO2 crystals as main absorbers. In all cases, the\nsurface event rejection capability is clearly demonstrated. In addition,\nsimulations and preliminary results show that it is possible to detect energy\ndepositions that occurred on the shields without separate readout channels for\nthem. The energy depositions in the shields are distinguished from those in the\nmain absorber through pulse shape discrimination. This simplification makes\nthis technique a viable method for the rejection of surface energy depositions\nin next-generation bolometric double beta decay searches, such as possible\nextensions or upgrades of the CUORE experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 03:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}

The horizontal, divergent flows within supergranule cells carry local\nfield lines to the cell boundaries, while the rotational properties of\nsupergranule upflows may contribute to the restoration of the poloidal field as\npart of the dynamo mechanism that controls the solar cycle. The solar minimum\nat the transition from cycle 23 to 24 was notable for its low level of activity\nand its extended length. It is of interest to study whether the convective\nphenomena that influences the solar magnetic field during this time differed in\ncharacter to periods of previous minima.

To place previous work in\ncontext and extend work on heuristics for conditional planning, we provide a\nformal basis for distance estimates between belief states. We give a definition\nfor the distance between belief states that relies on aggregating underlying\nstate distance measures. We give several techniques to aggregate state\ndistances and their associated properties. Many existing heuristics exhibit a\nsubset of the properties, but in order to provide a standardized comparison we\npresent several generalizations of planning graph heuristics that are used in a\nsingle planner. We compliment our belief state distance estimate framework by\nalso investigating efficient planning graph data structures that incorporate\nBDDs to compute the most effective heuristics.\n  We developed two planners to serve as test-beds for our investigation. The\nfirst, CAltAlt, is a conformant regression planner that uses A* search. The\nsecond, POND, is a conditional progression planner that uses AO* search.

The C18O cube (alpha-delta-vLSR) data shows that there are three\nclumps with sizes of \\sim 1 pc in the region. Two of them have peculiar red\nshifted velocity components at their edges, which can be interpreted as the\nresults of the interaction between the cloud and the Cepheus Bubble. From the\nC18O cube data, the clumpfind identified 123 C18O cores, which have mean\nradius, velocity width in FWHM, and LTE mass of 0.36\\pm0.07 pc, 0.37\\pm0.09 km\ns-1, and 41\\pm29 Msun, respectively. All the cores in S140 are most likely to\nbe gravitationally bound by considering the uncertainty in the C18O abundance.\nWe derived a C18O core mass function (CMF), which shows a power-law-like\nbehavior above a turnover at 30 Msun. The best-fit power-law index of\n-2.1\\pm0.2 is quite consistent with those of the IMF and the C18O CMF in the\nOMC-1 region by Ikeda & Kitamura (2009). Kramer et al. (1998) estimated the\npower-law index of -1.65 in S140 from the C18O(J=2-1) data, which is\ninconsistent with this study. However, the C18O(J=2-1) data are spatially\nlimited to the central part of the cloud and are likely to be biased toward\nhigh-mass cores, leading to the flatter CMF. Consequently, this study and our\nprevious one strongly support that the power-law form of the IMF has been\nalready determined at the density of \\sim 10^{3-4} cm^{-3}, traced by the\nC18O(J=1-0) line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 06:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We aim at studying the\nstructure and evolution of the object in the decline from the 2002 eruption. We\nobtained spectroscopic observations of V838 Mon in January--March 2009 with\nUVES/VLT. The results are analysed and compared with similar observations\nobtained in October 2005 with HIRES/Keck. The most striking difference between\n2009 and 2005 is a complete absence of the B3V component and of the [FeII]\nemission lines in 2009. The present spectrum displays only the spectrum of the\n2002 eruption remnant. It resembles that of an M6 giant, although the molecular\nbands in V838 Mon are deeper than those in standard stellar spectra of a\nsimilar spectral class. Several atomic lines, which displayed P-Cyg profiles in\n2005, are now dominated by pure absorptions. Some of these lines, however, show\na narrow emission component, which, as we argue, measures the radial velocity\nof V838 Mon.

In some atomic lines and\nhigh-excitation molecular bands we observe matter infalling in the object\natmosphere.

From several lines\nof reasoning, we show that the mass ratio of the component losing mass to the\nmass-gaining component $q$ must be larger than 1 and find our most probable\nvalue to be $q=1.15\\pm0.1$. The BINSYN suite of programs and the steepest\ndescent method were used to perform the final modeling. We modeled the star as\na W Ser star with a thick disk around its primary. Although the remaining\nuncertainties in some of the basic physical elements describing the system in\nour model are not negligible, the model is in fair agreement with available\nobservations. Only the nature of the light variations outside the primary\neclipse remains unexplained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 12:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This paper studies the generic case\nwhere the SU can sense more than one channel each time. By characterizing the\nmyopic sensing policy in this context, we establish analytically its optimality\nfor certain system setting when the SU is allowed to sense two channels.

Spectroscopically, it appears superficially\nsimilar to the class of subluminous SN1991bg-like SNe, but it has several\nunusual features which make it stand out from this population. Its peak\nluminosity is fainter than any previously discovered SN1991bg-like SN Ia (M_B\n-15.5), but without the unusually red optical colors expected if the faint\nluminosity were due to extinction. The photospheric optical spectra have very\nunusual strong lines of Sc II and Mg I, with possible Sr II, together with\nstronger than average Ti II and low velocities of ~6000 km/s. The host galaxy\nof PTF09dav is ambiguous. The SN lies either on the extreme outskirts (~41kpc)\nof a spiral galaxy, or in an very faint (M_R>-12.8) dwarf galaxy, unlike other\n1991bg-like SNe which are invariably associated with massive, old stellar\npopulations. PTF09dav is also an outlier on the light-curve-width--luminosity\nand color--luminosity relations derived for other sub-luminous SNe Ia. The\ninferred 56Ni mass is small (0.019+/-0.003Msun), as is the estimated ejecta\nmass of 0.36Msun. Taken together, these properties make PTF09dav a remarkable\nevent. We discuss various physical models that could explain PTF09dav. Helium\nshell detonation or deflagration on the surface of a CO white-dwarf can explain\nsome of the features of PTF09dav, including the presence of Sc and the low\nphotospheric velocities, but the observed Si and Mg are not predicted to be\nvery abundant in these models.

They arise naturally in expert elicitation, for instance in\ncases where bounds are specified on the quantiles of a random variable, or when\nquantiles are specified only at a finite number of points. Many practical and\nformal results concerning p-boxes already exist in the literature. In this\npaper, we provide new efficient tools to construct multivariate p-boxes and\ndevelop algorithms to draw inferences from them. For this purpose, we formalise\nand extend the theory of p-boxes using Walley's behavioural theory of imprecise\nprobabilities, and heavily rely on its notion of natural extension and existing\nresults about independence modeling. In particular, we allow p-boxes to be\ndefined on arbitrary totally preordered spaces, hence thereby also admitting\nmultivariate p-boxes via probability bounds over any collection of nested sets.\nWe focus on the cases of independence (using the factorization property), and\nof unknown dependence (using the Fr\\'echet bounds), and we show that our\napproach extends the probabilistic arithmetic of Williamson and Downs. Two\ndesign problems---a damped oscillator, and a river dike---demonstrate the\npractical feasibility of our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 15:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 10:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

We construct asymptotically AdS\nsolutions of Einstein's gravity dual to such processes at strong coupling,\nperturbatively in the amplitude expansion, where the expansion parameter is the\nratio of the amplitude of the non-hydrodynamic shear-stress tensor to the\npressure. At each order, we sum over all time derivatives through exact\nrecursion relations. We argue that the metric has a regular future horizon,\norder by order in the amplitude expansion, provided the shear-stress tensor\nfollows an equation of motion. At the linear order, this equation of motion\nimplies that the metric perturbations are composed of zero wavelength\nquasinormal modes. Our method allows us to calculate the non-linear corrections\nto this equation perturbatively in the amplitude expansion. We thus derive a\nspecial case of our previous conjecture on the regularity condition on the\nboundary stress tensor that endows the bulk metric with a regular future\nhorizon, and also refine it further.
