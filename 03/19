The\ntotal collapse or singularity that occurs when starting from one of the five\ncentral configurations (two triangular and three collinear) generates periodic\nsolutions and the singularity mimics an elastic bounce. Periodic solutions\nwithout collisions where found by Standish : three particles fall from an\ninitial triangle to each other and without colliding, come later to rest on\nanother triangle where the motion reverses. Singularities where the motion\nends, are illustrated by equal particles starting from an isosceles triangle.\nThe lack of continuity in neighbouring solutions is illustrated by particles\nstarting from a nearly equatorial triangle. Although the total energy is\nnegative, an elliptic-hyperbolic break up of the system where all three\nparticles go to infinity. is possible. Two particles are tightly bound in\nelliptic motion, their CoM recedes to infinity while in an hyperbolic motion\nwith the third particle. The famous historic case of the Pythagorean triangle\nshows that such a break up may happen after a long time and several close\npassages. The break-up in a elliptic hyperbolic system occurs in a very short\ntime period around a very close passage. Progress in the understanding the\ninteractions between the particles when they are very close,can lead to sharper\nescape criteria.

The resulting relay selection scheme is\nreferred to as max-max relay selection (MMRS). Since for finite buffer sizes,\nempty and full buffers are practically unavoidable if MMRS is employed, we\npropose a hybrid relay selection (HRS) scheme, which is a combination of\nconventional best relay selection (BRS) and MMRS. We analyze the outage\nprobabilities of MMRS and HRS and show that both schemes achieve the same\ndiversity gain as conventional BRS and a superior coding gain. Furthermore, our\nresults show that for moderate buffer sizes (e.g. 30 packets) HRS closely\napproaches the performance of idealized MMRS and the performance gain compared\nto BRS approaches 3 dB as the number of relays increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 17:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-21"}

With our suite of over 200 merger\nsimulations, we identify systematic trends in the behavior of recoiling BHs.\nOur main results are as follows. (1) While BHs kicked at nearly the central\nescape speed (vesc) are essentially \"lost\" to the galaxy, in gas rich mergers,\nBHs kicked with up to about 0.7 vesc may be confined to the central few kpc of\nthe galaxy. (2) The inflow of cold gas during a gas-rich major merger may cause\na rapid increase in central escape speed; in such cases recoil trajectories\nwill depend on the timing of the BH merger relative to the change in vesc. (3)\nRecoil events generally reduce the lifetimes of bright active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) but may actually extend AGN lifetimes at lower luminosities.

These mass deficits lower the normalization of the M -\nsigma relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter.

We assume that there are two users, one\nhalf-duplex relay, and a common destination, each equipped with single antenna.\nFor the Rayleigh fading, the DDF protocol is well known and has been analyzed\nin terms of the DMT with infinite block length. By carefully dealing with\nproperties specific to finite block length, we characterize the finite block\nlength DMT which takes into account the fact that the event of decoding error\nat the relay causes the degradation in error performance when the block length\nis finite. Furthermore, we consider the situation where the destination does\nnot have a priori knowledge of the relay decision time at which the relay\nswitches from listening to transmitting. By introducing a decision rejection\ncriterion such that the relay forwards message only when its decision is\nreliable, and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) at the destination\nthat jointly decodes the relay decision time and the information message, our\nanalysis show that the optimal DMT is achievable as if there is no decoding\nerror at the relay and the relay decision time is known at the destination.\nTherefore, infinite block length and additional overhead for communicating the\ndecision time are not needed for the DDF to achieve the optimal DMT. To further\nimprove the DMT, we propose the HDAF protocol which take advantages of both the\nDDF and the Amplified-and-Forward protocols by judiciously choosing which\nprotocol to use. Our result shows that the HDAF protocol outperforms the\noriginal DDF in the DMT perspective.

We treat invariants counting pairs\n$\\O^n\\into \\E$ on a $\\K3$ surface for $\\E$ an arbitrary stable sheaf of a fixed\nnumerical type (\"coherent systems\" in the language of \\cite{KY}) whose first\nChern class is primitive, and fully compute them geometrically. The ordinary\nstable pair theory of $\\K3$ surfaces is treated by \\cite{MPT}; there they prove\nthe KKV conjecture in primitive classes by showing the resulting partition\nfunctions are governed by quasimodular forms. We prove a \"higher\" KKV\nconjecture by showing that our higher rank partition functions are modular\nforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 23:16:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 16:08:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 02:10:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2013 17:41:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 18:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-19"}

We address the \\emph{rebuilding ratio} problem, namely, in the case\nof erasures, what is the the fraction of the remaining information that needs\nto be accessed in order to rebuild \\emph{exactly} the lost information? It is\nclear that when the number of erasures equals the maximum number of erasures\nthat an MDS code can correct then the rebuilding ratio is 1 (access all the\nremaining information). However, the interesting (and more practical) case is\nwhen the number of erasures is smaller than the erasure correcting capability\nof the code.

Although there are variety of methods for solving such problems,\nmost statisticians find constrained estimation challenging. The current paper\nproposes a new path following algorithm for quadratic programming based on\nexact penalization. Similar penalties arise in $l_1$ regularization in model\nselection. Classical penalty methods solve a sequence of unconstrained problems\nthat put greater and greater stress on meeting the constraints. In the limit as\nthe penalty constant tends to $\\infty$, one recovers the constrained solution.\nIn the exact penalty method, squared penalties are replaced by absolute value\npenalties, and the solution is recovered for a finite value of the penalty\nconstant. The exact path following method starts at the unconstrained solution\nand follows the solution path as the penalty constant increases. In the\nprocess, the solution path hits, slides along, and exits from the various\nconstraints. Path following in lasso penalized regression, in contrast, starts\nwith a large value of the penalty constant and works its way downward. In both\nsettings, inspection of the entire solution path is revealing. Just as with the\nlasso and generalized lasso, it is possible to plot the effective degrees of\nfreedom along the solution path. For a strictly convex quadratic program, the\nexact penalty algorithm can be framed entirely in terms of the sweep operator\nof regression analysis. A few well chosen examples illustrate the mechanics and\npotential of path following.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2011 01:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

The resulting optimal\nrate-payoff region is expressed with information theoretic inequalities, and\nthe optimal communication methods are not standard source coding techniques but\ninstead are methods that stem from synthesizing a memoryless channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2011 03:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 03:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Moreover, with\nthe increasing scale of the trust alliance, costs of validation grow so quickly\nthat they do not adapt to incremental deployment. Via comparison with\ntraditional solutions, this article proposes a hierarchical, inter-domain\nauthenticated source address validation solution named SafeZone. SafeZone\nemploys two intelligent designs, lightweight tag replacement and a hierarchical\npartitioning scheme, each of which helps to ensure that SafeZone can construct\ntrustworthy and hierarchical trust alliances without the negative influences\nand complex operations on de facto networks. Extensive experiments also\nindicate that SafeZone can effectively obtain the design goals of a\nhierarchical architecture, along with lightweight, loose coupling and\n\"multi-fence support\" and as well as an incremental deployment scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2011 09:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

The field of magnetic massive stars has\nseen tremendous progress in recent years. Different perspectives -- ranging\nfrom direct field measurements over dynamo theory and stellar evolution to\ncolliding winds and the stellar environment -- fruitfully combine into a most\ninteresting and still evolving overall picture, which we attempt to review\nhere. Zeeman signatures leave no doubt that at least some O- and early B-type\nstars have a surface magnetic field. Indirect evidence, especially non-thermal\nradio emission from colliding winds, suggests many more. The emerging picture\nfor massive stars shows similarities with results from intermediate mass stars,\nfor which much more data are available. Observations are often compatible with\na dipole or low order multi-pole field of about 1 kG (O-stars) or 300 G to 30\nkG (Ap / Bp stars). Weak and unordered fields have been detected in the O-star\nzeta-Ori A and in Vega, the first normal A-type star with a magnetic field.\nTheory offers essentially two explanations for the origin of the observed\nsurface fields: fossil fields, particularly for strong and ordered fields, or\ndifferent dynamo mechanisms, preferentially for less ordered fields. Numerical\nsimulations yield the first concrete stable (fossil) field configuration, but\ngive contradictory results as to whether dynamo action in the radiative\nenvelope of massive main sequence stars is possible. Internal magnetic fields,\nwhich may not even show up at the stellar surface, affect stellar evolution as\nthey lead to a more uniform rotation, with more slowly rotating cores and\nfaster surface rotation.

TDDFT is then applied to the\ncalculation of total cross sections for ionization processes in the\nantiproton-Helium collision system. The Kohn-Sham potential is approximated as\nthe sum of the Hartree-exchange potential and a correlation potential that was\nproposed in the context of laser-induced ionization. Furthermore, some\napproaches to the problem of calculating the ionization probabilities from the\ndensity are discussed. Small projectile energies below 5keV are considered as\nwell as those in the range from 5 to 1000 keV. Results are compared with former\ncalculations and with experimental data. We find that the correlation potential\nyields no obvious improvement of the results over the exchange-only\napproximation where the correlation potential is neglected. Furthermore, we\nfind the problem of calculating the desired observables crucial, introducing\nerrors of at least the same order of magnitude as the correlation potential.\nFor the case of small energies we find that trajectory effects play an\nimportant role: the ionization cross sections are enlarged significantly if\ncurved instead of straight-line trajectories are used for the projectile\nmotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2011 14:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

As well-known, a single\nneuron is itself an uncertain, noisy unit with a finite unnegligible error in\nthe input-output relation. To model the situation artificially, a kind of 'heat\nbath' that surrounds neurons is introduced. The heat bath, which is a source of\nnoise, is specified by the 'temperature'. Several studies concerning the\npattern-recalling processes of the Hopfield model governed by the\nGlauber-dynamics at finite temperature were already reported. However, we might\nextend the 'thermal noise' to the quantum-mechanical variant. In this paper, in\nterms of the stochastic process of quantum-mechanical Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethod (the quantum MCMC), we analytically derive macroscopically deterministic\nequations of order parameters such as 'overlap' in a quantum-mechanical variant\nof the Hopfield neural networks (let us call \"quantum Hopfield model\" or\n\"quantum Hopfield networks\"). For the case in which non-extensive number $p$ of\npatterns are embedded via asymmetric Hebbian connections, namely, $p/N \\to 0$\nfor the number of neuron $N \\to \\infty$ ('far from saturation'), we evaluate\nthe recalling processes for one of the built-in patterns under the influence of\nquantum-mechanical noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2011 14:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
