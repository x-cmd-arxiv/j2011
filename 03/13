We analyze an\narchival 10.5 ksec ROSAT/PSPC observation to extract the surface-brightness\nprofile of PKS 0745-191 and infer the deprojected density profile. We then\ncompare the ROSAT surface-brightness profile with the Suzaku result. We perform\na mass analysis combining the ROSAT density profile and the published\ntemperature profiles from different instruments. We find that the ROSAT\nsurface-brightness profile is statistically inconsistent (7.7 sigma) with the\nSuzaku result around and beyond the value of r200 estimated by Suzaku. We argue\nthat, thanks to its large field of view and low background, ROSAT/PSPC is to\nthe present day the most sensitive instrument to low surface-brightness X-ray\nemission in the 0.4-2.0 keV band. We also note that the Suzaku temperature and\nmass profiles are at odds with the results from at least two other satellites\n(XMM-Newton and Swift). The difference in surface brightness between ROSAT and\nSuzaku is most likely explained by the existence of additional foreground\ncomponents at the low Galactic latitude of the source, which were not taken\ninto account in the Suzaku background modeling. In light of our mass analysis,\nwe conclude that any estimate of the fraction of the virial radius reached by\nX-ray measures is affected by systematic errors of the order of 25%. As a\nresult, the properties of the ICM at the virial radius are still uncertain, and\nthe Suzaku results should be considered with caution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2011 16:03:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2011 08:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-07"}

Hence, the spectra of the odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei\narise as a result of the consequent and self-consistent coupling of the fermion\ndegrees of freedom of the odd particles, specified by the fermion sector\n$SO^{F}(2\\Omega)\\subset OSp(2\\Omega/12,R)$, to the boson core which states\nbelong to an $Sp^{B}(12,R)$ irreducible representation.\n  The theoretical predictions for different low-lying collective bands with\npositive and negative parity for two sets of neighboring nuclei with distinct\ncollective properties are compared with experiment and IBM/IBFM/IBFFM\npredictions.

Multiple signals are\nanalyzed jointly, with multiple sensing matrices, under the assumption that the\nunknown signals come from a union of a small number of disjoint subspaces. This\nproblem is important, for instance, in image inpainting applications, in which\nthe multiple signals are constituted by (incomplete) image patches taken from\nthe overall image. This work extends standard dictionary learning and\nblock-sparse dictionary optimization, by considering compressive measurements,\ne.g., incomplete data). Previous work on blind compressed sensing is also\ngeneralized by using multiple sensing matrices and relaxing some of the\nrestrictions on the learned dictionary. Drawing on results developed in the\ncontext of matrix completion, it is proven that both the dictionary and signals\ncan be recovered with high probability from compressed measurements. The\nsolution is unique up to block permutations and invertible linear\ntransformations of the dictionary atoms. The recovery is contingent on the\nnumber of measurements per signal and the number of signals being sufficiently\nlarge; bounds are derived for these quantities. In addition, this paper\npresents a computationally practical algorithm that performs dictionary\nlearning and signal recovery, and establishes conditions for its convergence to\na local optimum. Experimental results for image inpainting demonstrate the\ncapabilities of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2011 18:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

This success brings to forefront the\nquestion of naturalness: Does a sufficiently long slow roll inflation occur\ngenerically or does it require a careful fine tuning of initial parameters? In\nrecent years there has been considerable controversy on this issue. In\nparticular, for a quadratic potential, Kofman, Linde and Mukhanov have argued\nthat the probability of inflation with at least 65 e-foldings is close to one,\nwhile Gibbons and Turok have argued that this probability is suppressed by a\nfactor of ~ $\\10^{-85}$. We first clarify that such dramatically different\npredictions can arise because the required measure on the space of solutions is\nintrinsically ambiguous in general relativity. We then show that this ambiguity\ncan be naturally resolved in loop quantum cosmology (LQC) because the big bang\nis replaced by a big bounce and the bounce surface can be used to introduce the\nstructure necessary to specify a satisfactory measure.\n  The second goal of the paper is to present a detailed analysis of the\ninflationary dynamics of LQC using analytical and numerical methods. By\ncombining this information with the measure on the space of solutions, we\naddress a sharper question than those investigated in the literature: What is\nthe probability of a sufficiently long slow roll inflation WHICH IS COMPATIBLE\nWITH THE SEVEN YEAR WMAP DATA? We show that the probability is very close to 1.\n  The material is so organized that cosmologists who may be more interested in\nthe inflationary dynamics in LQC than in the subtleties associated with\nmeasures can skip that material without loss of continuity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2011 20:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Understanding the accessibility\nproperties of fitness landscapes is conceptually important in answering\nquestions about the predictability and repeatability of evolutionary\nadaptation.

By analyzing subgraphs of the\nfull landscape containing different subsets of mutations, we are able to probe\nthe mutational distance scale in the empirical data.

First, we separately solved the statistical equilibrium equations and\ncompute opacities and intensity while neglecting polariza- tion. Then we used\nthese quantities as input for calculating scattering polarization and the Hanle\neffect. We have found that it is impossible to fit the intensity and\npolarization simultaneously at different limb angles in the frame- work of\nstandard 1D modeling. The atmosphere models that provide correct intensity\ncenter-to-limb variations fail to fit linear polar- ization center-to-limb\nvariations due to lacking radiation field anisotropy. We had to increase the\nanisotropy by means of a specially introduced free parameter. This allows us to\nsuccessfully interpret our observations. We discuss possible reasons for\nunderestimating the anisotropy in the 1D modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2011 15:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We apply it to coordinate measurement of a free quantum\nparticle that is initially confined to a domain $D\\subset\\rR^d$ and is observed\ncontinuously by illuminating $\\rR^d-D$. The continuous collapse axiom (CCA)\ndefines the post-measurement wave function (PMWF)in $D$ after a negative\nmeasurement as the solution of Schr\\\"odinger's equation at time $\\tau$ with\ninstantaneously collapsed initial condition and homogeneous Dirichlet condition\non the boundary of $D$. The CCA applies to all cases that exhibit the Zeno\neffect. It rids quantum mechanics of the unphysical artifacts caused by\ninstantaneous collapse and introduces no new artifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2011 15:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-15"}
