We consider the SINR model,\nwhich compares the received power of a signal at a receiver against the sum of\nstrengths of other interfering signals plus background noise. To describe the\nbehavior of a multi-station network, we use the convenient representation of a\n\\emph{reception map}. In the SINR model, the resulting \\emph{SINR diagram}\npartitions the plane into reception zones, one per station, and the\ncomplementary region of the plane where no station can be heard. We consider\nthe general case where transmission energies are arbitrary (or non-uniform).\nUnder that setting, the reception zones are not necessarily convex or even\nconnected. This poses the algorithmic challenge of designing efficient point\nlocation techniques as well as the theoretical challenge of understanding the\ngeometry of SINR diagrams. We achieve several results in both directions. We\nestablish a form of weaker convexity in the case where stations are aligned on\na line. In addition, one of our key results concerns the behavior of a\n$(d+1)$-dimensional map. Specifically, although the $d$-dimensional map might\nbe highly fractured, drawing the map in one dimension higher \"heals\" the zones,\nwhich become connected. In addition, as a step toward establishing a weaker\nform of convexity for the $d$-dimensional map, we study the interference\nfunction and show that it satisfies the maximum principle. Finally, we turn to\nconsider algorithmic applications, and propose a new variant of approximate\npoint location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 16:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 13:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-25"}

On the basis of XMM-Newton observations, we investigate the energy\nbalance of selected magnetic cataclysmic variables, which have shown an extreme\nsoft-to-hard X-ray flux ratio in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey.\n  Aims. We intend to establish the X-ray properties of the system components,\ntheir flux contributions, and the accretion geometry of the X-ray soft polar QS\nTel. In the context of high-resolution X-ray analyses of magnetic cataclysmic\nvariables, this study will contribute to better understanding the accretion\nprocesses on magnetic white dwarfs.\n  Methods. During an intermediate high state of accretion of QS Tel, we have\nobtained 20 ks of XMM-Newton data, corresponding to more than two orbital\nperiods, accompanied by simultaneous optical photometry and phase-resolved\nspectroscopy. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectra and light curves and\ncompare them to former high- and low-state observations.\n  Results. Soft emission at energies below 2 keV dominates the X-ray light\ncurves. The complex double-peaked maxima are disrupted by a sharp dip in the\nvery soft energy range (0.1-0.5 keV), where the count rate abruptly drops to\nzero. The EPIC spectra are described by a minimally absorbed black body at 20\neV and two partially absorbed MEKAL plasma models with temperatures around 0.2\nand 3 keV. The black-body-like component arises from one mainly active, soft\nX-ray bright accretion region nearly facing the mass donor. Parts of the plasma\nemission might be attributed to the second, virtually inactive pole. High\nsoft-to-hard X-ray flux ratios and hardness ratios demonstrate that the\nhigh-energy emission of QS Tel is substantially dominated by its X-ray soft\ncomponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 16:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

For 1906 thin disk and 110 thick disk stars classified in this\nway, we find a vertical velocity dispersion, mean rotational velocity and mean\norbital eccentricity of (sigma_W, Vphi, e)_thin = (18\\pm0.3 km/s, 223\\pm0.4\nkm/s, 0.07\\pm0.07) and (sigma_W, Vphi, e)_thick = (35\\pm2 km/s, 163\\pm2 km/s,\n0.31\\pm0.16), respectively.

By performing a joint\nlikelihood analysis of the recent SNIa data, the CMB shift parameter, and the\nBAOs traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we put tight constraints on the\nmain cosmological parameters.

It is evident that a crucial\ntask is the development of an automatic detection tool of CMEs precursors.

This led to the detection of one dwarf nova showing several outbursts.\nA Chandra X-ray source is coincident with this dwarf nova and shows both a\nspectrum and variability consistent with that expected from a dwarf nova, thus\nsupporting the identification. We searched for a counterpart in Hubble Space\nTelescope ACS/WFC archived images and found at least 11 candidates, of which we\ncould characterize only the 7 brightest, including one with a 3 sigma H-alpha\nexcess and a faint blue star. The detection of one dwarf nova when more could\nhave been expected likely indicates that our knowledge of the global Galactic\npopulation of cataclysmic variables is too limited. The proportion of dwarf\nnovae may be lower than found in catalogs, or they may have a much smaller duty\ncycle in general as proposed by some population synthesis models and recent\nobservations in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 21:54:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 21:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The corresponding tune/detune\npulse is single-step, with a near-resonant constant undershoot between the 200\nand 101 states. During the pulse, the frequency of the first qubit is kept\nfixed, while the frequency of the second qubit is varied in such a way as to\nbring the 200 and 101 states close to resonance. As a result, the phase of the\n101 state is accumulated via the corresponding second-order anticrossing. For\nexperimentally realistic qubit frequencies and a 75 MHz coupling (150 MHz\nsplitting), a 45 ns gate time can be realized with >99.99% intrinsic fidelity,\nwith errors arising due to the non-adiabaticity of the ramps. The CZ pulse is\ncharacterized by two adjustable parameters: the undershoot magnitude and\nundershoot duration. The pulse does not load an excitation into the bus. This\nby-passes the previously proposed need for two additional qubit-to-bus and\nbus-to-qubit MOVE operations. Combined with the recently predicted\nhigh-fidelity idling operation in the RezQu architecture [A. Galiautdinov, J.\nMartinis, A.

Aging is prejudicial to the individual and evolutionary forces should\nprevent it, but many species show signs of senescence as individuals age. Here,\nI will propose a model for aging based on assumptions that are compatible with\nevolutionary theory: i) competition is between individuals; ii) there is some\ndegree of locality, so quite often competition will between parents and their\nprogeny; iii) optimal conditions are not stationary, mutation helps each\nspecies to keep competitive. When conditions change, a senescent species can\ndrive immortal competitors to extinction. This counter-intuitive result arises\nfrom the pruning caused by the death of elder individuals. When there is change\nand mutation, each generation is slightly better adapted to the new conditions,\nbut some older individuals survive by random chance. Senescence can eliminate\nthose from the genetic pool. Even though individual selection forces always win\nover group selection ones, it is not exactly the individual that is selected,\nbut its lineage. While senescence damages the individuals and has an\nevolutionary cost, it has a benefit of its own. It allows each lineage to adapt\nfaster to changing conditions.

The model is relevant to the case of the\nsubstitutional vacancy in graphene. If the second neighbor interaction is large\nenough ($t' > t /3$), then the linear Dirac bands no longer occur at the Fermi\nenergy and the electronic structure is therefore fundamentally changed. With\nonly the nearest neighbor interactions present, there is particle-hole\nsymmetry, as a result of which the vacancy induces a \"zero-mode\" state at the\nband center with its wave function entirely on the majority sublattice, i. e.,\non the sublattice not containing the vacancy. With the introduction of the\nsecond neighbor interaction, the zero-mode state broadens into a resonance peak\nand its wave function spreads into both sublattices, as may be argued from the\nLippmann-Schwinger equation. The zero-mode state disappears entirely for the\ntriangular lattice and if $t'$ is large for the honeycomb lattice as well. In\ncase of graphene, $t'$ is relatively small, so that a well-defined zero-mode\nstate occurs in the vicinity of the band center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 04:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-22"}

At such power the plasma and higher-order Kerr terms are too\nsmall to prevent self-focusing.

However, while Na and O appear\nto be anticorrelated in the cluster stars, from the stellar models they turn\nout to be correlated into the AGB ejecta. In order to reconcile the stellar\ntheory with the observational findings, all the GC models invoke an early\ndilution of AGB ejecta with pristine gas occurring during the SG formation.\nDespite a vast consensus about the occurrence of such dilution, the physical\nprocess behind it is still unknown. In the present paper we set some general\nconstraints on the pristine gas dynamics and on the possible amount of pristine\ngas involved in the SG formation, making use of a one zone chemical model. We\nfind that such a dilution is a necessary ingredient in the SG star formation to\nexplain the observed abundance patterns.

The order O is called\nmonogenic, if it is of the shape Z[w], i.e., generated over the rational\nintegers by one element. By a result of Gy\\H{o}ry (1976), the set of w with\nZ[w]=O is a union of finitely many equivalence classes, where two elements v,w\nof O are called equivalent if v+w or v-w is a rational integer. An order O is\ncalled k times monogenic if there are at least k different equivalence classes\nof w with Z[w]=O, and precisely k times monogenic if there are precisely k such\nequivalence classes. It is known that every quadratic order is precisely one\ntime monogenic, while in number fields of degree larger than 2, there may be\nnon-monogenic orders. In this paper we study orders which are more than one\ntime monogenic. Our first main result is, that in any number field K of degree\nat least 3 there are only finitely many three times monogenic orders. Next, we\ndefine two special types of two times monogenic orders, and show that there are\nnumber fields K which have infinitely many orders of these types. Then under\ncertain conditions imposed on the Galois group of the normal closure of K, we\nprove that K has only finitely many two times monogenic orders which are not of\nthese types.

One can push the intuition of redundancy further and find an\nintuitive notion of interest of an association rule, in terms of its \"novelty\"\nwith respect to other rules. Namely: an irredundant rule is so because its\nconfidence is higher than what the rest of the rules would suggest; then, one\ncan ask: how much higher? We propose to measure such a sort of \"novelty\"\nthrough the confidence boost of a rule, which encompasses two previous similar\nnotions (confidence width and rule blocking, of which the latter is closely\nrelated to the earlier measure \"improvement\"). Acting as a complement to\nconfidence and support, the confidence boost helps to obtain small and crisp\nsets of mined association rules, and solves the well-known problem that, in\ncertain cases, rules of negative correlation may pass the confidence bound. We\nanalyze the properties of two versions of the notion of confidence boost, one\nof them a natural generalization of the other. We develop efficient\nalgorithmics to filter rules according to their confidence boost, compare the\nconcept to some similar notions in the bibliography, and describe the results\nof some experimentation employing the new notions on standard benchmark\ndatasets.

Additionally, in order to avoid\nlimited lifetime issues, sensors may be powered via energy harvesting and thus\ncollect all the energy they need from the environment. This work addresses the\nproblem of energy allocation over source acquisition/compression and\ntransmission for energy-harvesting sensors. At first, focusing on a\nsingle-sensor, energy management policies are identified that guarantee a\nmaximal average distortion while at the same time ensuring the stability of the\nqueue connecting source and channel encoders. It is shown that the identified\nclass of policies is optimal in the sense that it stabilizes the queue whenever\nthis is feasible by any other technique that satisfies the same average\ndistortion constraint.

The newly discovered masers\nspan the isotropic luminosity range 0.3-1.9 x 10^-3 L(Sun) in single spectral\ncomponents and are analogous to luminous Galactic masers. The masers are\ndistributed around the molecular ring, including locations close to the major\nand minor axes, which is nearly ideal for proper motion studies. We find no\ncorrelation between 24 micron luminosity and water maser luminosity, suggesting\nthat while water masers arise in star-forming regions, the nonlinear\namplification pathways and beamed nature of the water masers means that they\nare not predictable based on IR luminosity alone. This suggests that there are\nadditional bright masers to be found in M31. We predict that the geometric\ndistance and systemic proper motion of M31 can be measured in 2-3 years with\ncurrent facilities. A \"moving cluster\" observation of diverging masers as M31\napproaches the Galaxy may be possible in the long term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 15:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The\ndata consist of 4714 radio quasars from FIRST with S_{20}>2mJy and SDSS\nspectra. Radio morphology classes include core-only (core), core-lobe (lobe),\ncore-jet (jet), lobe-core-lobe (triple), and double-lobe. We examine the\noptical colors of radio-morphology subsamples and find that radio quasars with\ncore emission unresolved by FIRST (on 5\" scale) have a redder color\ndistribution than radio-quiet quasars (S_{20}<1mJy); other classes of radio\nquasars have optical color distributions similar to the radio-quiet quasars.\nThis analysis also suggests that optical colors of z<2.7 SDSS quasars are not\nstrongly (<0.1mag) biased blue. We show that the radio core-to-lobe flux\ndensity ratio (R) and the radio-to-optical (i-band) ratio of the quasar core\n(RI) are correlated, suggesting that both parameters are indicative of\nline-of-sight orientation. We investigate spectral line equivalent widths as a\nfunction of R and RI, including the [OIII] narrow line doublet and the CIV\n{\\lambda}1549 and MgII {\\lambda}2799 broad lines. We find that the rest\nequivalent widths (EWs) of the broad lines correlate positively with RI at the\n4-8{\\sigma} level. But we find no strong dependence of EW on R, in contrast to\nprevious results. One interpretation is that EWs increase as the line-of-sight\nangle to the radio-jet axis decreases. These results are in stark contrast to\ncommonly accepted orientation-based theories, which suggest that continuum\nemission should increase as the angle to the radio-jet axis decreases,\nresulting in smaller EW of emission lines (assumed isotropic). Finally, we find\nthat the Baldwin effect in our sample does not depend on quasar radio\nmorphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 15:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-10"}

As a result, the Higgs mass is\npredicted to be just above the LEP2 bound, m_h=115.9\\pm 2 GeV, corresponding to\na minimal Delta=17.8, value obtained from consistency with electroweak and WMAP\n(3\\sigma) constraints, but without the LEP2 bound. Due to quantum corrections\n(largely QCD ones for m_h above LEP2 bound), Delta grows \\approx exponentially\non either side of the above value of m_h, which stresses the relevance of this\nprediction.

The size of the supersymmetric\ncorrection that each individual operator of d=6 brings to the value of m_h for\npoints with Delta<100, is found to be small, of few (<4) GeV for M=8 TeV, where\nM is the scale of new physics. This value decreases (increases) by\napproximately 1 GeV for a 1 TeV increase (decrease) of the scale M.
