Our goal is to\nunderstand the physics determining the infrared spectral energy distribution\n(SED). The ratio of the total infrared luminosity L_TIR, to the star-formation\nrate (SFR) is tightly correlated by a power-law to specific SFR (SSFR), and\nL_TIR is a good SFR indicator only for galaxies with the largest SSFR. We\ndiscovered a tight linear correlation for normal galaxies between the radiation\nfield strength of dust heating, estimated by infrared SED fits (U_h), and that\nof galactic-scale infrared emission (U_TIR ~ L_TIR/R^2), where R is the optical\nsize of a galaxy. The dispersion of U_h along this relation is 0.3 dex,\ncorresponding to 13% dispersion in the dust temperature. This scaling and the\nU_h/U_TIR ratio can be explained physically by a thin layer of heating sources\nembedded in a thicker, optically-thick dust screen. The data also indicate that\nthe heated fraction of the total dust mass is anti-correlated to the dust\ncolumn density, supporting this interpretation. In the large U_TIR limit, the\ndata of circumnuclear starbursts indicate the existence of an upper limit on\nU_h, corresponding to the maximum SFR per gas mass of ~ 10 Gyr^{-1}. We find\nthat the number of galaxies sharply drops when they become optically thin\nagainst dust-heating radiation, suggesting that a feedback process to galaxy\nformation (likely by the photoelectric heating) is working when dust-heating\nradiation is not self-shielded on a galactic scale. Implications are discussed\nfor the M_HI-size relation, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and galaxy\nformation in the cosmological context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 16:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2011 11:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 06:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This article is divided into two parts. In\nthe first part, we analyze the volume and content of online articles published\nby both bloggers and mainstream news sources from June 14 (the day V-day was\nannounced) until September 15, 2007 (one week after it took place) .

We also find a dissonant thematic\nrelationship between content published by blogs and mainstream media: while the\nmajority of blogs analyzed promote V-day, major mainstream media sources\ncritique the methods of information production and dissemination employed by\nGrillo. Based on this finding, in the second part of the study, we explore the\nrole of Grillo in the organization of the rally from a network analysis\nperspective. We study the interlinking structure of the V-day blogosphere\nnetwork, to determine its structure, its levels of heterogeneity, and\nresilience. Our analysis contradicts the hypothesis that Grillo served as a\ntop-down, broadcast-like source of information. Rather, we find that\ninformation about V-day was transferred across heterogeneous nodes in a\nmoderately robust and resilient core network of blogs.

That these\nproperties correlate in the observer's frame indicates that intrinsic\ncorrelations are strong enough to not be diluted into insignificance by the\ndispersion in distances and redshift.

We demonstrate that for such states\nthe reduced density matrix of a finite spatial region of the gapped topological\nstate is a thermal density matrix of the chiral edge state CFT which would\nappear at the spatial boundary of that region. We obtain this result by\napplying a physical instantaneous cut to the gapped system, and by viewing the\ncutting process as a sudden \"quantum quench\" into a CFT, using the tools of\nboundary conformal field theory. We thus provide a demonstration of the\nobservation made by Li and Haldane about the relationship between the\nentanglement spectrum and the spectrum of a physical edge state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 18:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-13"}

Mergers of star clusters are able to\nproduce a wide variety of observed properties, including densities, structural\nscaling relations, shapes (including the presence of young discs) and even\nrapid rotation. Nonetheless, difficulties remain, most notably that the second\norder kinematic moment V_rms = (V^2 + sigma^2)^(1/2) of the models is too\ncentrally peaked to match observations.

To\nperform this investigation, we introduce fundamental concepts of conservative\nand dissipative dynamics of the three-body problem.

The\nscheme treats the steady state portion of the cascade by equating mass loss and\ngain in each size bin; the smallest particles are expected to reach steady\nstate on their collision timescale, while larger particles retain their\nprimordial distribution. For collision-dominated disks, steady state means that\nmass loss rates in logarithmic size bins are independent of size. This\nprescription reproduces the expected two phase size distribution, with ripples\nabove the blow-out size, and above the transition to gravity-dominated\nplanetesimal strength. The scheme also reproduces the expected evolution of\ndisk mass, and of dust mass, but is computationally much faster than evolving\ndistributions forward in time. For low-mass disks, P-R drag causes a turnover\nat small sizes to a size distribution that is set by the redistribution\nfunction (the mass distribution of fragments produced in collisions). Thus\ninformation about the redistribution function may be recovered by measuring the\nsize distribution of particles undergoing loss by P-R drag, such as that traced\nby particles accreted onto Earth.

After correcting for\nforeground Galactic extinction we determine the absolute magnitude to be M_V\n=-22.7 approximately 45 days after maximum light.

High-resolution\nHST and Keck followup observations show the event occurred within 150pc of\nnucleus of the galaxy, suggesting a possible link to the active nuclear region.\nHowever, the rapid outburst along with photometric and spectroscopic evolution\nare much more consistent with a luminous supernova.

We review the free field approach to diagonalization of\nthe boundary transfer matrix $T_B(z)$ associated with $U_q(A_2^{(2)})$ and\n$U_{q,p}(\\hat{sl_N})$. We construct the free field realizations of the\neigenvectors of the boundary transfer matrix $T_B(z)$. This paper includes new\nunpublished formula of the eigenvector for $U_q(A_2^{(2)})$. It is thought that\nthis diagonalization method can be extended to more general quantum group\n$U_q(g)$ and elliptic quantum group $U_{q,p}(g)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 01:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

M87 (NGC\n4486) and Centaurus A (NGC 5128, CenA) are well-studied nearby LLAGNs. As an\nadditional feature they show gamma-radiation up to TeV (10^{12}eV) energies,\nbut the origin of this radiation is not resolved. The coincident observation of\na radio and TeV flare in M87 suggests that the TeV radiation is produced within\naround 50-100 gravitational radii of the central supermassive black hole,\ndepending on the assumed value of the mass of the black hole. Strong radiation\nfields can be produced in the central region of an (LL)AGN, e.g., by the\naccretion flow around the black hole, the jet plasma, or stars closely orbiting\nthe black hole. These radiation fields can lead to the absorption of emitted\nTeV photons, and in fact high optical depths of such fields can make TeV\ndetection from inner regions impossible. In this paper we consider the\naccretion flow around the black hole as the most prominent source for such a\nradiation field and we accordingly calculate the probability for absorption of\nTeV photons produced near the black holes in M87 and CenA assuming a low\nluminosity Shakura-Sunyaev Disk (SSD). We find that the results are very\ndifferent for between the two LLAGNs. While the inner region of M87 is\ntransparent for TeV radiation up to 15TeV, the optical depth in CenA is >> 1,\nleading to an absorption of TeV photons that might be produced near the central\nblack hole. These results imply either that the TeV gamma production sites and\nprocesses are different for both sources, or that LLAGN black holes do not\naccrete (at least only) in form of a low luminosity SSD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 06:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The calculation of the latter tensor is\nreduced to the resolution of an auxiliary differential problem, consisting of a\ncoupled set of two differential equations in a (6+1)-dimensional coordinate\nsystem (3 space coordinates plus 3 velocity coordinates plus time). Although\nexpensive, numerical methods can be exploited to obtain the eddy diffusivity,\nfor any desirable non-perturbative limit (e.g. arbitrary Stokes and Froude\nnumbers).

Our program is designed to study the dark matter distribution\nin 25 massive clusters, and balances depth with a wide wavelength coverage to\nbetter identify lensed systems and generate precise photometric redshifts. This\ninformation together with the predictive strength of our strong-lensing\nanalysis method identifies 13 new multiply-lensed images and candidates, so\nthat a total of 27 multiple-images of 9 systems are used to tightly constrain\nthe inner mass profile, $d\\log \\Sigma/d\\log r\\simeq -0.6\\pm 0.1$ (r<160 kpc).\nWe find consistency with the standard distance-redshift relation for the full\nrange spanned by the lensed images, 1.01<z<6.03, with the higher redshift\nsources deflected through larger angles as expected. The inner mass profile\nderived here is consistent with the results of our independent weak-lensing\nanalysis of wide-field Subaru images, with good agreement in the region of\noverlap. The overall mass profile is well fitted by an NFW profile with\nM_{vir}=(5.37^{+0.70}_{-0.63}\\pm 0.26) x 10^{14}M_{\\odot}/h and a relatively\nhigh concentration, c_{vir}=8.77^{+0.44}_{-0.42}\\pm 0.23, which lies above the\nstandard c-M relation similar to other well-studied clusters. The critical\nradius of Abell 383 is modest by the standards of other lensing clusters,\nr_{E}\\simeq16\\pm2\\arcsec (for z_s=2.55), so the relatively large number of\nlensed images uncovered here with precise photometric redshifts validates our\nimaging strategy for the CLASH survey. In total we aim to provide similarly\nhigh-quality lensing data for 25 clusters, 20 of which are X-ray selected\nrelaxed clusters, enabling a precise determination of the representative mass\nprofile free from lensing bias.

We show that the\npartially linear minimum mean squared error (PLMMSE) estimator does not require\nknowing the joint distribution of X and Y in full, but rather only its\nsecond-order moments. This renders it of potential interest in various\napplications. We further show that the PLMMSE method is minimax-optimal among\nall estimators that solely depend on the second-order statistics of X and Y. We\ndemonstrate our approach in the context of recovering a signal, which is sparse\nin a unitary dictionary, from noisy observations of it and of a filtered\nversion of it. We show that in this setting PLMMSE estimation has a clear\ncomputational advantage, while its performance is comparable to\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. We apply our approach both in static and dynamic\nestimation applications. In the former category, we treat the problem of image\nenhancement from blurred/noisy image pairs, where we show that PLMMSE\nestimation performs only slightly worse than state-of-the art algorithms, while\nrunning an order of magnitude faster. In the dynamic setting, we provide a\nrecursive implementation of the estimator and demonstrate its utility in the\ncontext of tracking maneuvering targets from position and acceleration\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 13:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 08:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Proximity of a limit cycle to one or more saddle equilibria can have a\nprofound effect on the timing of trajectory components and response to both\nfast and slow perturbations, providing a possible mechanism for adaptive\ncontrol of rhythmic motions. Reyn showed that for a planar dynamical system\nwith a stable heteroclinic cycle (or separatrix polygon), small perturbations\nsatisfying a net inflow condition will generically give rise to a stable limit\ncycle (Reyn, 1980; Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1983). Here we consider the\nasymptotic behavior of the infinitesimal phase response curve (iPRC) for\nexamples of two systems satisfying Reyn's inflow criterion, (i) a smooth system\nwith a chain of four hyperbolic saddle points and (ii) a piecewise linear\nsystem corresponding to local linearization of the smooth system about its\nsaddle points. For system (ii), we obtain exact expressions for the limit cycle\nand the iPRC as a function of a parameter, mu>0, representing the distance from\na heteroclinic bifurcation point. In the limit, as mu approaches zero, we find\nthat perturbations parallel to the unstable eigenvector direction in a\npiecewise linear region lead to divergent phase response, as previously\nobserved (Brown, Moehlis and Holmes (2004), Neural Computation). In contrast to\nprevious work, we find that perturbations parallel to the stable eigenvector\ndirection can lead to either divergent or convergent phase response, depending\non the phase at which the perturbation occurs. In the smooth system (i), we\nshow numerical evidence of qualitatively similar phase specific sensitivity to\nperturbation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 14:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-30"}

To study the nature and origin of the X-ray emission we use high\nspatial resolution images from Chandra. Our goal is to probe the density of\nvarious spectral extraction regions to form a picture of the cavity wall and\ncharacterize the interaction between this supernova and the local interstellar\nmedium. We find that a series of regions along the edge of the X-ray emission\nappears to trace out the location of the cavity wall. The best fit plasma\nmodels result in two temperature component equilibrium models for each region.\nThe low temperature components have densities that are an order of magnitude\nhigher than the high temperature components. The high density plasma may exist\nin the cavity wall where it equilibrates rapidly and cools efficiently. The low\ndensity plasma is interior to the enhancement and heated further by a reverse\nshock from the wall. Calculations of shock velocities and timescales since\nshock heating are consistent with this interpretation. Furthermore, we find a\nbright knot of emission indicative of a discrete interaction of the blast wave\nwith a high density cloud in the cavity wall with a size scale ~0.1 pc. Aside\nfrom this, other extractions made interior to the X-ray edge are confused by\nline of sight projection of various components. Some of these regions show\nevidence of detecting the cavity wall but their location makes the\ninterpretation difficult.

Here, we argue that female\nmeiotic drivers - alleles that increase in frequency by exploiting the\nasymmetric cell division of oogenesis - present a potent selective pressure\nfavoring the modification of the female recombination rate. Because\nrecombination plays a central role in shaping patterns of variation within and\namong dyads, modifiers of the female recombination rate can function as potent\nsuppressors or enhancers of female meiotic drive. We show that when female\nrecombination modifiers are unlinked to female drivers, recombination modifiers\nthat suppress harmful female drive can spread. By contrast, a recombination\nmodifier tightly linked to a driver can increase in frequency by enhancing\nfemale drive. Our results predict that rapidly evolving female recombination\nrates, particularly around centromeres, should be a common outcome of meiotic\ndrive. We discuss how selection to modify the efficacy of meiotic drive may\ncontribute to commonly observed patterns of sex-differences in recombination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 16:27:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 00:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-12"}

The Lorentz boosts\nimply non-associative addition of ternary relative velocities. Within\nEinstein's special relativity theory, each preferred observer (fixed stars,\naether, etc), determine the unique relative velocity among each pair of massive\nbodies. Therefore, the special relativity founded on Minkowski's axiom, that\neach pair of reference systems must be related by Lorentz isometry, needs a\npreferred reference system in order to have the unique Einstein's relative\nvelocity among each pair of massive bodies. This choice-dependence of relative\nvelocity violate the Relativity Principle that all reference systems must be\nequivalent. This astonishing conflict of the Lorentz relativity group, with the\nRelativity Principle, can be resolved in two alternative ways. Either, abandon\nthe Relativity Principle in favor of a preferred reference system [de Abreu\n2004; de Abreu and Guerra 2005, 2006]. Or, within the Relativity Principle,\nreplace the Lorentz relativity group by the relativity groupoid, with the\nchoice-free binary relative velocities introduced by Minkowski in 1908. Binary\n- means that the relative velocity is a function of a pair of reference\nsystems. Following Minkowski [1908], we consider the binary relative velocity\nto be the Minkowski space-like vector (and not the Minkowski bivector as it is\nin the Hestenes theory [Hestenes 1974]).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 09:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-06"}
