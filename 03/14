The 12CO-line bright region morphologically matches the eastern\nbright radio shell in general, and the SNR is consistent in extent with a CO\ncavity.

The\nX-rays arising from the northeastern radio shell are emitted by underionized\nhot (~1.5 keV), low-density (~0.1 cm^{-3}) plasma with solar abundance, and the\nplasma may be of intercloud origin.

Results\nare presented for mu = 1/2, 1, and 3/2 corresponding to cluster diffusion via\nBrownian motion, correlated evaporation-condensation, and edge-diffusion\nrespectively, as well as for higher values including mu = 2,3, and 6. We also\ncompare our results with those obtained in the limit of no cluster mobility\ncorresponding to mu = infinity.

Instead, the scaled ISD becomes more sharply peaked with\nincreasing R and coverage. This is in contrast to models of epitaxial growth\nwith limited cluster mobility for which good scaling occurs over a wide range\nof coverages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2011 20:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

For\nexample, photospheric flows are responsible for the advection of magnetic flux,\nthe redistribution of flux during the decay of sunspots, and the built-up of\nmagnetic shear in flaring active regions. Aims: Systematic studies based on\nG-band data from the Japanese Hinode mission provide the means to gather\nstatistical properties of horizontal flow fields. This facilitates comparative\nstudies of solar features, e.g., G-band bright points, magnetic knots, pores,\nand sunspots at various stages of evolution and in distinct magnetic\nenvironments, thus, enhancing our understanding of the dynamic Sun. Methods: We\nadapted Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) to measure horizontal flow fields\nbased on G-band images obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope on board\nHinode. In total about 200 time-series with a duration between 1-16 h and a\ncadence between 15-90 s were analyzed. Selecting both a high-cadence (dt = 15\ns) and a long-duration (dT = 16 h) time-series enabled us to optimize and\nvalidate the LCT input parameters, hence, ensuring a robust, reliable, uniform,\nand accurate processing of a huge data volume. Results: The LCT algorithm\nproduces best results for G-band images having a cadence of 60-90 s. If the\ncadence is lower, the velocity of slowly moving features will not be reliably\ndetected. If the cadence is higher, the scene on the Sun will have evolved too\nmuch to bear any resemblance with the earlier situation. Consequently, in both\ninstances horizontal proper motions are underestimated. The most reliable and\nyet detailed flow maps are produced using a Gaussian kernel with a size of 2560\nkm x 2560 km and a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 1200 km (corresponding\nto the size of a typical granule) as sampling window.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 10:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Buyers and sellers in\nsuccessful markets carry out cooperative transactions even if they do not know\neach other in advance and a moral hazard exists. An indispensable component\nthat enables cooperation in such social dilemma situations is the reputation\nsystem. Under the reputation system, a buyer can avoid transacting with a\nseller with a bad reputation. A transaction in online marketplaces is better\nmodeled by the trust game than other social dilemma games, including the\ndonation game and the prisoner's dilemma. In addition, most individuals\nparticipate mostly as buyers or sellers; each individual does not play the two\nroles with equal probability. Although the reputation mechanism is known to be\nable to remove the moral hazard in games with asymmetric roles, competition\nbetween different strategies and population dynamics of such a game are not\nsufficiently understood. On the other hand, existing models of reputation-based\ncooperation, also known as indirect reciprocity, are based on the symmetric\ndonation game. We analyze the trust game with two fixed roles, where trustees\n(i.e., sellers) but not investors (i.e., buyers) possess reputation scores. We\nstudy the equilibria and the replicator dynamics of the game. We show that the\nreputation mechanism enables cooperation between unacquainted buyers and\nsellers under fairly generous conditions, even when such a cooperative\nequilibrium coexists with an asocial equilibrium in which buyers do not buy and\nsellers cheat. In addition, we show that not many buyers may care about the\nseller's reputation under cooperative equilibrium.

Unfortunately, the use of redundancy introduces\nstorage and communication overheads, which can either reduce the overall\nstorage capacity of the system or increase its costs. To mitigate the storage\nand communication overhead, different redundancy schemes have been proposed.\nHowever, due to the great variety of underlaying storage infrastructures and\nthe different application needs, optimizing these redundancy schemes for each\nstorage infrastructure is cumbersome. The lack of rules to determine the\noptimal level of redundancy for each storage configuration leads developers in\nindustry to often choose simpler redundancy schemes, which are usually not the\noptimal ones. In this paper we analyze the cost of different redundancy schemes\nand derive a set of rules to determine which redundancy scheme minimizes the\nstorage and the communication costs for a given system configuration.\nAdditionally, we use simulation to show that theoretically-optimal schemes may\nnot be viable in a realistic setting where nodes can go off-line and repairs\nmay be delayed. In these cases, we identify which are the trade-offs between\nthe storage and communication overheads of the redundancy scheme and its data\nreliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 13:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 10:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Methods: We compiled\na list of members and possible members of Lupus 1, 3, and 4, together with all\ninformation on their spectral types, disks, and physical parameters. Using\nVO-tools, we cross-matched this list with the astrometric catalogues to get pm.\nOur final sample contains sources with magnitudes I<16mag and estimated masses\n>~0.1Msun. Results: According to the kinematic information, our sources can be\ndivided into two main groups. The first one contains sources with higher pm in\nagreement with other Gould Belt populations and with spatial distribution,\noptical and near-infrared colours, and disk composition consistent with these\nobjects belonging to the Lupus clouds. In the second group, sources have lower\npm with random orientations, and they are mostly located outside the cloud\ncores, making their association with the Lupus complex more doubtful. We\ninvestigate the properties of the higher pm group, but cannot find any\ncorrelations with spatial location, binarity, the presence of a circumstellar\ndisk, or with physical properties such as effective temperature, luminosity,\nmass, or age. Conclusions: We conclude that the lower pm group probably\nrepresents a background population or mixture of populations unrelated to the\nLupus clouds. The higher pm group, on the other hand, has properties consistent\nwith it being a genuine population of the Lupus star-forming region. More\naccurate pm and/or radial velocity information are required for a more detailed\nstudy of the kinematic properties of the Lupus stellar members.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 13:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We derive the\noptimality conditions defining the cooperative-Lasso estimate for generalized\nlinear models, and propose an efficient active set algorithm suited to\nhigh-dimensional problems. We study the asymptotic consistency of the estimator\nin the linear regression setup and derive its irrepresentable conditions, which\nare milder than the ones of the group-Lasso regarding the matching of groups\nwith the sparsity pattern of the true parameters. We also address the problem\nof model selection in linear regression by deriving an approximation of the\ndegrees of freedom of the cooperative-Lasso estimator.

We first ignore special relativistic\neffects and derive a differential equation governing the evolution of the\ndensity contrast in the linear regime taking into account quantum pressure and\nself-interaction. This equation can be solved analytically in several cases. We\nargue that an attractive self-interaction can enhance the Jeans instability and\nfasten the formation of structures. Then, we take into account pressure effects\n(coming from special relativity) in the evolution of the cosmic fluid and add\nthe contribution of radiation, baryons and dark energy (cosmological constant).\nFor a BEC dark matter with repulsive self-interaction (positive pressure) the\nscale factor increases more rapidly than in the standard \\Lambda CDM model\nwhere dark matter is pressureless while for a BEC dark matter with attractive\nself-interaction (negative pressure) it increases less rapidly. We study the\nlinear development of the perturbations in these two cases and show that the\nperturbations grow faster in a BEC dark matter than in a pressureless dark\nmatter. This confirms a recent result of Harko (2011). Finally, we consider a\n\"dark fluid\" with a generalized equation of state p=(\\alpha \\rho + k \\rho\n^2)c^2 having a component p=k \\rho ^2 c^2 similar to a BEC dark matter and a\ncomponent p=\\alpha \\rho c^2 mimicking the effect of the cosmological constant\n(dark energy).
