We found that quarkonium dissociation energy, i.e. the binding\nenergy at which dissociation probability is of order unity, increases with the\nmagnetic field strength. It also increases with quarkonium momentum in the\nlaboratory frame due to Lorentz boost of electric field in the comoving frame.\nAs a consequence, J/Psi in plasma dissociates at lower temperature then it\nwould be in the absence of a magnetic field. We argue that J/Psi's produced in\nheavy-ion collisions at LHC with P_T>9GeV would dissociate even in vacuum. In\nplasma, J/Psi dissociation in magnetic field is much stronger due to decrease\nof its binding energy with temperature. We discuss the phenomenological\nimplications of our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 18:48:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2011 21:06:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 21:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Among the many kind of structures in the\niron pnictide superconductors, FeSe with the PbO structure has received special\nattention since there is not poisonous pnictogen element in chemical\ncomposition and its structure is the simplest one. However, the superconducting\ntransition temperature (Tc) in iron chalcogenide compounds is not enhanced as\nhigh as other iron pnictide superconductors under ambient pressure until the\nsuperconductivity at above 30 K in potassium intercalated iron selenide\nKxFe2-ySe2 was discovered. The insulating and the superconducting state are\nboth observed in KxFe2-ySe2 with different stoichiometries and some groups have\ntuned the system from insulating to superconducting state by varying the ratio\nof starting materials[10, 11]. The recent data from neutron scattering suggest\nthat the superconductivity may be built upon an ordered state of Fe vacancies\nas well as the antiferromagnetic state with a very strong ordered magnetic\nmoment 3.4 B. Here we show that the superconductivity can actually be tuned on\na single sample directly from an insulating state by post-annealing and fast\nquenching. Upon waiting for some days at room temperatures, the\nsuperconductivity will disappear and the resistivity exhibits an insulating\nbehavior again.

Although they arise as\nthe Feynman diagrams from an action on twistor space in an axial gauge, the\nmain ingredients were previously expressed only in momentum space and momentum\ntwistor space. Here we show how the formalism can be elegantly derived and\nexpressed entirely in twistor space. This brings out the underlying\nsuperconformal invariance of the framework (up to the choice of a reference\ntwistor used to define the axial gauge) and makes the twistor support\ntransparent. Our treatment is largely independent of signature, although we\nfocus on Lorentz signature. Starting from the N=4 super-Yang-Mills twistor\naction, we obtain the propagator for the anti-holomorphic Dolbeault-operator as\na delta function imposing collinear support with the reference twistor defining\nthe axial gauge. The MHV vertices are also expressed in terms of similar delta\nfunctions. We obtain concrete formulae for tree-level N^{k}MHV diagrams as a\nproduct of MHV amplitudes with an R-invariant for each propagator; here the\nR-invariant manifests superconformal as opposed to dual-superconformal\ninvariance. This gives the expected explicit support on k+1 lines linked by k\nfurther lines associated to the propagators. The R-invariants arising\ncorrespond to those obtained in the dual conformal invariant momentum twistor\nversion of the formalism, but differences arise in the specification of the\nboundary terms.

We perform three-dimensional unstratified shearing-box\nsimulations of the MRI over a wide range of Am as well as different magnetic\nfield strengths and geometries. The saturation level of the MRI turbulence\ndepends on the magnetic geometry and increases with the net magnetic flux.\nThere is an upper limit to the net flux for sustained turbulence, corresponding\nto the requirement that the most unstable vertical wavelength be less than the\ndisk scale height.

In return, the secondary user gets more\nopportunities for transmitting its own data when the primary user is idle. This\nkind of interaction between the primary and secondary users is different from\nthe traditional dynamic spectrum access model in which the secondary users try\nto avoid interfering with the primary users while seeking transmission\nopportunities on vacant primary channels. In our model, the secondary users\nneed to balance the desire to cooperate more (to create more transmission\nopportunities) with the need for maintaining sufficient energy levels for their\nown transmissions. Such a model is applicable in the emerging area of cognitive\nfemtocell networks. We formulate the problem of maximizing the secondary user\nthroughput subject to a time average power constraint under these settings.\nThis is a constrained Markov Decision Problem and conventional solution\ntechniques based on dynamic programming require either extensive knowledge of\nthe system dynamics or learning based approaches that suffer from large\nconvergence times. However, using the technique of Lyapunov optimization, we\ndesign a novel greedy and online control algorithm that overcomes these\nchallenges and is provably optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 22:25:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 14:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2011 01:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-12"}

By non-redundant, we mean that the\naccounting of evidence for every interaction should be faithful: each\nindependent experimental support is counted exactly once, no more, no less.\nWhile many interactions are shared among public repositories, none of them\ncontains the complete known interactome for any model organism. In addition,\nthe annotations of the same experimental result by different repositories often\ndisagree. This brings up the issue of which annotation to keep while\nconsolidating evidences that are the same. The iRefIndex database, including\ninteractions from most popular repositories with a standardized protein\nnomenclature, represents a significant advance in all aspects, especially in\ncomprehensiveness. However, iRefIndex aims to maintain all\ninformation/annotation from original sources and requires users to perform\nadditional processing to fully achieve the aforementioned goals.\n  To address issues with iRefIndex and to achieve our goals, we have developed\nppiTrim, a script that processes iRefIndex to produce non-redundant,\nconsistently annotated datasets of physical interactions.

As an illustration, we have processed the three largest organismal\ndatasets: yeast, human and fruitfly.

These systems provide a view of dusty molecular gas\nand star formation, surrounded by dense, X-ray emitting intracluster gas. Past\nwork has shown that BCGs in cool-core clusters may host powerful radio sources,\nluminous optical emission line systems, and excess UV, while BCGs in other\nclusters never show this activity.

The mechanism inhibits\ntransitions into singly excited collective states of a two-atom system by\nshifting them from their unperturbed energies. The shift is accomplished by the\ndipole-dipole interaction between the atoms. The creation of the Bell state is\nfound to be dependent on the relaxation of the atomic excitation. When the\nrelaxation is not present or can be ignored, the state of the system evolves\nharmonically between a separable to the maximally entangled state. We follow\nthe temporal evolution of the state and find that the concurrence can be\ndifferent from zero only in the presence of the dipole-dipole interaction.\nFurthermore, in the limit of a large dipole-dipole interaction, the concurrence\nreduces to that predicted for an X-state of the system. A general inequality is\nfound which shows that the concurrence of an X-state system is a lower bound\nfor the concurrence of the two-atom system. With the relaxation present, the\ngeneral state of the system is a mixed state that under a strong dipole-dipole\ninteraction reduces the system to an X-state form. We find that mixed states\nadmit of lower level of entanglement, and the entanglement may occur over a\nfinite range of time. A simple analytical expression is obtained for the\nsteady-state concurrence which shows that there is a threshold value for the\ndipole-dipole interaction relative to the Rabi frequency of the driving field\nabove which the atoms can be entangled over the entire time of the evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 06:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 09:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-03"}

Its\nmajor goal is to determine {\\eta}_Earth, the fraction of Sunlike stars that\nhave planets like Earth.

From analysis of\nthe first four months of those measurements for over 150,000 stars, Kepler's\nscience team has determined sizes, surface temperatures, orbit sizes and\nperiods for over a thousand new planet candidates.

To model the other common components of a BEC\ninterferometer---condensate splitting, manipulation, and recombination---we\ngeneralize the slowly-varying envelope reduction, providing both analytic\nhandles and dramatically improved simulations. Applying these tools to a BEC\ninterferometer to measure the fine structure constant (Gupta, et al., 2002), we\nfind agreement with the results of the original experiment and demonstrate that\natomic interactions do not preclude measurement to better than part-per-billion\naccuracy, even for atomic species with relatively large scattering lengths.\nThese tools help make BEC interferometry a viable choice for a broad class of\nprecision measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 07:48:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2011 23:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

With this approach some explicit\nalgorithms can be applied to solve the initial value problem of $n-$dimensional\ndamped oscillators. This approach is based upon following structure: for any\nnon-conservative classical mechanical system and arbitrary initial conditions,\nthere exists a conservative system; both systems share one and only one common\nphase curve; and, the value of the Hamiltonian of the conservative system is,\nup to an additive constant, equal to the total energy of the non-conservative\nsystem on the aforementioned phase curve, the constant depending on the initial\nconditions. A key way applying explicit symplectic algorithms to damping\noscillators is that by the Newton-Laplace principle the nonconservative force\ncan be reasonably assumed to be equal to a function of a component of\ngeneralized coordinates $q_i$ along a phase curve, such that the damping force\ncan be represented as a function analogous to an elastic restoring force\nnumerically in advance. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the\ngood characteristics of the algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 08:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-09"}

In this modified gravity theory, the main effect\nof the gravitons is to alter the density evolution of the cold dark matter\ncomponent in such a way that the Universe evolves to an accelerating expanding\nregime, as presently observed. Tight constraints on the main cosmological\nparameters of the MGCDM model are derived by performing a joint likelihood\nanalysis involving the recent supernovae type Ia data, the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) shift parameter and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs)\nas traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) red luminous galaxies. The\nlinear evolution of small density fluctuations is also analysed in detail. It\nis found that the growth factor of the MGCDM model is slightly different\n($\\sim1-4%$) from the one provided by the conventional flat $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology. The growth rate of clustering predicted by MGCDM and $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodels are confronted to the observations and the corresponding best fit values\nof the growth index ($\\gamma$) are also determined. By using the expectations\nof realistic future X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich cluster surveys we derive the\ndark-matter halo mass function and the corresponding redshift distribution of\ncluster-size halos for the MGCDM model. Finally, we also show that the Hubble\nflow differences between the MGCDM and the $\\Lambda$CDM models provide a halo\nredshift distribution departing significantly from the ones predicted by other\nDE models.

Three new applications of the orbital angular\nmomentum reversal (H-reversal) trajectories using solar sails are presented in\nthis paper: space observation, heliocentric orbit transfer, and collision\norbits with asteroids. A theoretical proof for the existence of double\nH-reversal trajectories (referred to as 'H2RTs') is given, and the\ncharacteristics of the H2RTs are introduced before the discussion of the\nmission applications. A new family of H2RTs was obtained using a 3D dynamic\nmodel of the two-body frame. In a time-optimal control model, the minimum\nperiod H2RTs both inside and outside the ecliptic plane were examined using an\nideal solar sail. Due to the quasi-heliostationary property at its two\nsymmetrical aphelia, the H2RTs were deemed suitable for space observation. For\nthe second application, the heliocentric transfer orbit was able to function as\nthe time-optimal H-reversal trajectory, as its perihelion velocity is circular\nor elliptic velocity. Such a transfer orbit can place the sailcraft into a\nclockwise orbit in the ecliptic plane, with a high inclination or displacement\nabove or below the Sun. The third application of the H-reversal trajectory was\nsimulated impacting an asteroid passing near Earth in a head-on collision. The\ncollision point can be designed through selecting different perihelia or\ndifferent launch windows. Sample orbits of each application were presented\nthrough numerical simulation. The results can serve as a reference for\ntheoretical research and engineering design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 09:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In order to do that, we define the power spectrum of a\nrandom field as the ensemble average of its Wigner measure, this allows\nphase-space computations: the pseudo-differential calculus and the ray theory.\nThis way, we get a formula for the correlation of the seismic noise in the\nsemi-classcial regime with a source noise which can be localized and non\nhomogeneous.

Recent developments, however, have paved the way for a\nnew approach in which the information exchange happens between single quanta of\nlight and matter. This single-particle approach allows one to address the\nmaterial qubit and thus has fundamental advantages for realistic\nimplementations: First, to combat inevitable losses and finite efficiencies, it\nenables a heralding mechanism that signals the successful storage of a photon\nby means of state detection. Second, it allows for individual qubit\nmanipulations, opening up avenues for in situ processing of the stored quantum\ninformation. Here we demonstrate the most fundamental implementation of such a\nquantum memory by mapping arbitrary polarization states of light into and out\nof a single atom trapped inside an optical cavity. The memory performance is\nanalyzed through full quantum process tomography. The average fidelity is\nmeasured to be 93% and low decoherence rates result in storage times exceeding\n180\\mu s. This makes our system a versatile quantum node with excellent\nperspectives for optical quantum gates and quantum repeaters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 13:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-13"}

At present, lattice simulations have\noffered the practicable ways of theoretically guiding us to search for the\nhybrid states.\n  In this dissertation, we study the spectroscopy and the decay rate of the\nheavy hybrid mesons made of a heavy $b$ quark, a heavy $\\bar b$ antiquark, and\na gluon ($b\\bar{b}g$) to selected channels, and use lattice methods to extract\nthe transition matrix elements in full QCD.

To prevent the jets from penetrating through the\ncollapsing stellar core and escape with their energy, instead of forming the\nhot bubbles, the jets should be prevented from drilling a hole through the\nstar. This condition can be met if the jets' axis rapidly changes its\ndirection. This process of depositing jets' energy into the ambient medium is\ntermed the it penetrating jet feedback mechanism. The feedback exists in that\nthe neutron star (or a black hole) at the center of the core collapse supernova\nshuts off its own growth by exploding the star.

The model is expressed as a linear mixture of the\nindividual layers of both constituent white dwarfs, taking account of the\nspecific evolution of each star. In developing this recipe from previous\nversions, particular attention has been given to the inter-shell abundances of\nthe asymptotic giant branch star which evolved to become the carbon-oxygen\nwhite dwarf. Thus the surface composition of the merged star is estimated as a\nfunction of the initial mass and metallicity of its progenitor. The question of\nwhether additional nucleosynthesis occurs during the white dwarf merger has\nbeen examined.\n  The high observed abundances of carbon and oxygen must either originate by\ndredge-up from the core of the carbon-oxygen white dwarf during a cold merger\nor be generated directly by alpha-burning during a hot merger. The presence of\nlarge quantities of O18 may be consistent with both scenarios, since a\nsignificant O18 pocket develops at the carbon/helium boundary in a number of\nour post-AGB models.\n  The production of fluorine, neon and phosphorus in the AGB intershell\nproduces n overabundance at the surface of the merged stars, but generally not\nin sufficient quantity.

When considering the dynamics\nof an electrical circuit, one is faced with three special situations: 1. The\nsystem involves external (control) forcing through external (controlled)\nvoltage sources and resistors. 2. The system is constrained via the Kirchhoff\ncurrent (KCL) and voltage laws (KVL). 3. The Lagrangian is degenerate. Based on\na geometric setting, an appropriate variational formulation is presented to\nmodel the circuit from which the equations of motion are derived. A\ntime-discrete variational formulation provides an iteration scheme for the\nsimulation of the electric circuit. Dependent on the discretization, the\nintrinsic degeneracy of the system can be canceled for the discrete variational\nscheme. In this way, a variational integrator is constructed that gains several\nadvantages compared to standard integration tools for circuits; in particular,\na comparison to BDF methods (which are usually the method of choice for the\nsimulation of electric circuits) shows that even for simple LCR circuits, a\nbetter energy behavior and frequency spectrum preservation can be observed\nusing the developed variational integrator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 09:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

I will furthermore introduce relevant facts that tend\nnot to receive adequate attention in much of the current Consciousness\ndiscourse. As a new approach to conceptualizing Consciousness, I propose\nconsidering it as a collective achievement of the brain' s complex neural\ndynamics that is amenable to study in the framework of state space dynamics and\ncriticality. In Physics, concepts of phase space transitions and the\nRenormalization Group are powerful tools for interpreting phenomena involving\nmany scales of length and time in complex systems. The significance of these\nconcepts lies in their accounting for the emergence of different levels of new\ncollective behaviors in complex systems, each level with its distinct ontology,\norganization and laws, as a new pattern of reality.
