Energetically soft, with semi-major axes exceeding the\ninitial size of their birth cluster, it is puzzling how these binaries are\ncreated and preserved. We provide an interpretation of the formation of these\nbinaries that explains the total number formed and their distribution of\nenergies. A population of weakly bound binaries can always be found in the\ncluster, in accordance with statistical detailed balance, limited at the soft\nend only by the current size of the cluster and whatever observational criteria\nare imposed. At any given time, the observed soft binary distribution is\npredominantly a snapshot of a transient population. However, there is a\nconstantly growing population of long-lived soft binaries that are removed from\nthe detailed balance cycle due to the changing density and velocity dispersion\nof an expanding cluster. The total number of wide binaries that form, and their\nenergy distribution, are insensitive to the cluster population; the number is\napproximately one per cluster. This suggests that a population composed of many\ndissolved small-N clusters will more efficiently populate the field with wide\nbinaries than that composed of dissolved large-N clusters. Locally such\nbinaries are present at approximately the 2% level; thus the production rate is\nconsistent with the field being populated by clusters with a median of a few\nhundred stars rather than a few thousand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 16:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Our sample of\nstudy includes nine M and X-class flares, all from the same active region (AR),\nsix of which are confined and three others are eruptive. The confined flares\ntend to be more impulsive in the soft X-ray time profiles and show more slender\nshapes in the EIT 195 A images, while the eruptive ones are of long-duration\nevents and show much more extended brightening regions. The location of the\nconfined flares are closer to the center of the AR, while the eruptive flares\nare at the outskirts. This difference is quantified by the displacement\nparameter, the distance between the AR center and the flare location: the\naverage displacement of the six confined flares is 16 Mm, while that of\neruptive ones is as large as 39 Mm. Further, through nonlinear force-free field\nextrapolation, we find that the decay index of the transverse magnetic field in\nthe low corona (~10 Mm) have a larger value for eruptive flares than that for\nconfined one. In addition, the strength of the transverse magnetic field over\nthe eruptive flare sites is weaker than that over the confined ones. These\nresults demonstrate that the strength and the decay index of background\nmagnetic field may determine whether or not a flare be eruptive or confined.\nThe implication of these results on CME models is discussed in the context of\ntorus instability of flux rope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 17:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We show\nthat applying SPPAM to the original correlated data, before the learning task,\ncan produce classifiers that are better than the ones trained using all\nrecords.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 18:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-14"}

We present a triple-star model\nfor producing MSPs in relatively wide eccentric binaries with a normal\n(main-sequence) stellar companion.

The best\nexplanation for J1903, however, results from the expansion of the orbit of the\nLMXB, driven by the mass transfer from the evolving donor star to its neutron\nstar companion, which causes the triple eventually to becomes dynamically\nunstable. Using numerical computations we show that, depending on the precise\nsystem configuration at the moment the triple becomes dynamically unstable, the\nejection of each of the three components is possible. If the donor star of the\nLMXB is ejected, a system resembling J1903, will result. If the neutron star is\nejected, a single MSP results. This model therefore also provides a\nstraightforward mechanism for forming single MSP in the Galactic disk.

In the 1980s, Feynman\nproposed the use of quantum logic gates on a standard controllable quantum\nsystem to efficiently simulate the behavior of a model Hamiltonian. Recent\nexperiments using trapped ions and neutral atoms have realized quantum\nsimulation of Ising model in presence of external magnetic fields, and showed\nalmost arbitrary control in generating non-trivial Ising coupling patterns.\nHere we use laser-cooled trapped 171-Yb+ ions to simulate the emergence of\nmagnetism in a system of interacting spins by implementing a fully-connected\nnon-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model in a transverse magnetic field. To link\nthis quantum simulation to condensed matter physics, we measure scalable\ncorrelation functions and order parameters appropriate for the description of\nlarger systems, such as various moments of the magnetization. By increasing the\nIsing coupling strengths compared with the external field, the crossover from\nparamagnetism to ferromagnetic order sharpens as the system is scaled up from N\n= 2 to 9 trapped ion spins. This points toward the onset of a quantum phase\ntransition that should become infinitely sharp as the system approaches the\nmacroscopic scale. We compare the measured ground state order to theory, which\nmay become intractable for non-uniform Ising couplings as the number of spins\ngrows beyond 20- 30 and even NP complete for a fully-connected frustrated Ising\nmodel, making this experiment an important benchmark for large-scale quantum\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2011 00:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-15"}

We\ndiscuss several limitations of existing misbehavior detection schemes (MDS)\ndesigned for VANETs. Most MDS are concerned with detection of malicious nodes.\nIn most situations, vehicles would send wrong information because of selfish\nreasons of their owners, e.g. for gaining access to a particular lane. Because\nof this (\\emph{rational behavior}), it is more important to detect false\ninformation than to identify misbehaving nodes. We introduce the concept of\ndata-centric misbehavior detection and propose algorithms which detect false\nalert messages and misbehaving nodes by observing their actions after sending\nout the alert messages. With the data-centric MDS, each node can independently\ndecide whether an information received is correct or false. The decision is\nbased on the consistency of recent messages and new alert with reported and\nestimated vehicle positions. No voting or majority decisions is needed, making\nour MDS resilient to Sybil attacks. Instead of revoking all the secret\ncredentials of misbehaving nodes, as done in most schemes, we impose fines on\nmisbehaving nodes (administered by the certification authority), discouraging\nthem to act selfishly. This reduces the computation and communication costs\ninvolved in revoking all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2011 00:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The RS model is\nobtained as an analytic continuation of the flat brane limit of this braneworld\nconfiguration when the Hubble parameter disappears. Within this inflating\nbraneworld model it is possible to formulate a mechanism for obtaining TeV mass\nscales from Planck ones by adding a positive thin brane, where the Standard\nModel fields are trapped, at a distance y_2 from the origin, where the Planck\nthick brane resides.

This family of mixed finite element methods can be\nthought of in the numerical weather prediction context as a generalisation of\nthe popular polygonal C-grid finite difference methods. There are a few major\nadvantages: the mixed finite element methods do not require an orthogonal grid,\nand they allow a degree of flexibility that can be exploited to ensure an\nappropriate ratio between the velocity and pressure degrees of freedom so as to\navoid spurious mode branches in the numerical dispersion relation. These\nmethods preserve several properties of the C-grid method when applied to linear\nbarotropic wave propagation, namely: a) energy conservation, b) mass\nconservation, c) no spurious pressure modes, and d) steady geostrophic modes on\nthe $f$-plane.

Our optimization criteria are the average electrical and optical\npower. The nonnegativity input signal constraint is translated into a conical\nconstraint in signal space, and modulation formats are designed by sphere\npacking inside this cone. Some remarkably dense packings are found, which yield\nmore power-efficient modulation formats than previously known. For example, at\na spectral efficiency of 1 bit/s/Hz, the obtained modulation format offers a\n0.86 dB average electrical power gain and 0.43 dB average optical power gain\nover the previously best known modulation formats to achieve a symbol error\nrate of 10^-6. This modulation turns out to have a lattice-based structure. At\na spectral efficiency of 3/2 bits/s/Hz and to achieve a symbol error rate of\n10^-6, the modulation format obtained for optimizing the average electrical\npower offers a 0.58 dB average electrical power gain over the best\nlattice-based modulation and 2.55 dB gain over the best previously known\nformat. However, the modulation format optimized for average optical power\noffers a 0.46 dB average optical power gain over the best lattice-based\nmodulation and 1.35 dB gain over the best previously known format.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2011 00:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
