The merging of the real world model and\ndigital objects allows streamline the work with the model and speed up the\nwhole production phase significantly. The main advantage of augmented reality\nis the possibility of direct manipulation with the scene using a portable\ndigital camera. Also adding digital objects into the scene could be done using\nidentification markers placed on the surface of the model. Therefore it is not\nnecessary to work with special input devices and lose the contact with the real\nworld model. Adjustments are done directly on the model. The key problem of\noutlined solution is the ability of identification of an object within the\ncamera picture and its replacement with the digital object. The second part of\nthe article is focused especially on the identification of exact position and\norientation of the marker within the picture. The identification marker is\ngeneralized into the triple of points which represents a general plane in\nspace. There is discussed the space identification of these points and the\ndescription of representation of their position and orientation be means of\ntransformation matrix.

An iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain an\noptimized power allocation strategy.

We also investigate the nature of this scatter about the MW\ndSph mass profiles for the \"Classical\" (i.e. M_V<-8) MW and M31 dSphs. When\ncomparing both the \"classical\" MW and M31 dSphs to the best--fit mass profiles\nin the size--velocity dispersion plane, we find general scatter in both the\npositive (i.e. hotter) and negative (i.e. colder) directions from these\nprofiles. However, barring one exception (CVnI) only the M31 dSphs are found to\nscatter towards a colder regime, and, excepting the And I dSph, only MW objects\nscatter to hotter dispersions. We also note that the scatter for the combined\npopulation is greater than expected from measurement errors alone. We assess\nthis divide in the context of the differing disc-to-halo mass (i.e. stars and\nbaryons to total virial mass) ratios of the two hosts and argue that the\nunderlying mass profiles for dSphs differ from galaxy to galaxy, and are\nmodified by the baryonic component of the host.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 20:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 15:41:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 16:15:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 11:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We find that much of the stream gas is ionized by UV\nradiation from background and local stellar sources, but still optically thick\n(N_HI > 10^17 cm^-2) so that the streams appear as Lyman-limit systems (LLSs).\nAt z>3, the fraction of neutral gas in streams becomes non-negligible, giving\nrise to damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) absorbers as well.

We do this by extending\nthe halo model. The new development is that we consider two components to the\nmass density: one arising from mass in collapsed haloes, and the second from a\nsmooth component of uncollapsed mass. Assuming that the nonlinear clustering of\ndark matter haloes can be understood, then from conservation arguments one can\nprecisely calculate the clustering properties of the smooth component and its\ncross-correlation with haloes. We then explore how the three main ingredients\nof the halo calculations, the mass function, bias and density profiles are\naffected by WDM. We show that, relative to CDM: the mass function is suppressed\nby ~50%, for masses ~100 times the free-streaming mass-scale; the bias of low\nmass haloes can be boosted by up to 20%; core densities of haloes can be\nsuppressed. We also examine the impact of relic thermal velocities on the\ndensity profiles, and find that these effects are constrained to scales r<1\nkpc/h, and hence of little importance for dark matter tests, owing to\nuncertainties in the baryonic physics. We use our modified halo model to\ncalculate the non-linear matter power spectrum, and find significant\nsmall-scale power in the model. However, relative to the CDM case, the power is\nsuppressed. We then calculate the expected signal and noise that our set of\nLWDM models would give for a future weak lensing mission. We show that the\nmodels should in principle be separable at high significance. Finally, using\nthe Fisher matrix formalism we forecast the limit on the WDM particle mass for\na future full-sky weak lensing mission like Euclid or LSST.

Based on our model, performance analyses of both schemes are\nstudied with probabilistic exponential backoff scheduling. We obtain the\ncharacteristic equation of network throughput and expressions of packet\nqueueing delay. Specifically, we obtain the stable throughput and bounded delay\nregions with respect to the retransmission factor according to the basic\nqueueing analysis. For both access schemes, the bounded delay region is a\nsubset of the stable throughput region. Our results show that the RTS/CTS\naccess mechanism is more stable and performs better than the Basic access\nmechanism. The analysis in this paper is verified by simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 08:10:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 02:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-12"}

A stereotype contains certain features of agents and an expected\noutcome of the transaction. When facing a stranger, an agent derives its trust\nby aggregating stereotypes matching the stranger's profile.

We show that\nfallback voting, an election system proposed by Brams and Sanver (2009) to\ncombine Bucklin with approval voting, is resistant to each of the common types\nof control except to destructive control by either adding or deleting voters.\nThus fallback voting displays the broadest control resistance currently known\nto hold among natural election systems with a polynomial-time winner problem.\nWe also study the control complexity of Bucklin voting and show that it\nperforms at least almost as well as fallback voting in terms of control\nresistance. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting, each\nresistance shown for Bucklin voting strengthens the corresponding resistance\nfor fallback voting. Such worst-case complexity analysis is at best an\nindication of security against control attempts, rather than a proof. In\npractice, the difficulty of control will depend on the structure of typical\ninstances. We investigate the parameterized control complexity of Bucklin and\nfallback voting, according to several parameters that are often likely to be\nsmall for typical instances.

We argue that in that region the heliospheric magnetic\nfield is not laminar but instead consists of magnetic bubbles. Recently, we\nproposed that the annihilation of the \"sectored\" magnetic field within the\nheliosheath as it is compressed on its approach to the heliopause produces the\nanomalous cosmic rays and also energetic electrons. As a product of the\nannihilation of the sectored magnetic field, densely-packed magnetic\nislands/bubbles are produced. These magnetic islands/bubbles will be convected\nwith the ambient flows as the sector region is carried to higher latitudes\nfilling the heliosheath. We further argue that the magnetic islands/bubbles\nwill develop upstream within the heliosheath. As a result, the magnetic field\nin the heliosheath sector region will be disordered well upstream of the\nheliopause. We present a 3D MHD simulation with very high numerical resolution\nthat captures the north-south boundaries of the sector region. We show that due\nto the high pressure of the interstellar magnetic field a north-south asymmetry\ndevelops such that the disordered sectored region fills a large portion of the\nnorthern part of the heliosphere with a smaller extension in the southern\nhemisphere. We suggest that this scenario is supported by the following changes\nthat occur around 2008 and from 2009.16 onward: a) the sudden decrease in the\nintensity of low energy electrons detected by Voyager 2; b) a sharp reduction\nin the intensity of fluctuations of the radial flow; and c) the dramatic\ndifferences in intensity trends between GCRs at V1 and 2.

An olog is like a \"concept web\" or \"semantic network\" except\nthat it follows a rigorous mathematical formulation based on category theory.\nThis key difference ensures that an olog is unambiguous, highly adaptable to\nevolution and change, and suitable for sharing concepts with other olog. We\nconsider simple cases of alpha-helical and amyloid-like protein filaments\nsubjected to axial extension and develop an olog representation of their\nstructural and resulting mechanical properties.

SRW has a single node permit, which is passed on in the\nnetwork. CRW, initially initially has a permit for each node but these permits\nare revoked gradually. The final result for SRW and CRW resides at a single(or\nfew) random node(s) making a direct comparison with GOSSIP difficult. A hybrid\ntwo-phase algorithm switching from CRW to CFLD at a suitable pre-determined\ntime can be employed to achieve consensus. We show that such hybrid variants\nachieve significant gains in both message and time complexity. The per-node\nmessage complexity for n-node graphs, such as 2D mesh, torii, and Random\ngeometric graphs, scales as $O(polylog(n))$ and the corresponding time\ncomplexity scales as O(n). The reduced per-node message complexity leads to\nreduced energy utilization in sensor networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 15:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In this remnant, the presence of overionized plasma\nhas been directly established, with information about its spatial structure.\nHowever, the physical origin of the overionized plasma in W49B has not yet been\nunderstood. We investigate this intriguing issue through a 2D hydrodynamic\nmodel that takes into account, for the first time, the mixing of ejecta with\nthe inhomogeneous circumstellar and interstellar medium, the thermal\nconduction, the radiative losses from optically thin plasma, and the deviations\nfrom equilibrium of ionization induced by plasma dynamics. The model was set up\non the basis of the observational results. We found that the thermal conduction\nplays an important role in the evolution of W49B, in- ducing the evaporation of\nthe circumstellar ring-like cloud (whose presence has been deduced from\nprevious observations) that mingles with the surrounding hot medium, cooling\ndown the shocked plasma, and pushes the ejecta backwards to the center of the\nremnant, forming there a jet-like structure. During the evolution, a large\nregion of overionized plasma forms within the remnant. The overionized plasma\noriginates from the rapid cooling of the hot plasma originally heated by the\nshock reflected from the dense ring-like cloud. In particular, we found two\ndifferent ways for the rapid cooling of plasma to appear: i) the mixing of\nrelatively cold and dense material evaporated from the ring with the hot\nshocked plasma and ii) the rapid adiabatic expansion of the ejecta. The spatial\ndistribution of the radiative recombination continuum predicted by the\nnumerical model is in good agreement with that observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 15:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

First, we\nstudy the behavior of particles with a fixed energy and identify different\ntransport regimes. For low energy, the particles are classically localized due\nto the absence of a percolating cluster. For high energy, the particles undergo\nnormal diffusion and we show that the diffusion constants scale algebraically\nwith the particle energy, with an anisotropy factor which significantly differs\nfrom that of the disordered potential. For intermediate energy, we find a\ntransient sub-diffusive regime, which is relevant to the time scale of typical\nexperiments. Second, we study the behavior of a cold-atomic gas with an\narbitrary energy distribution, using the above results as a groundwork. We show\nthat the density profile of the atomic cloud in the diffusion regime is\nstrongly peaked and, in particular, that it is not Gaussian. Its behavior at\nlarge distances allows us to extract the energy-dependent diffusion constants\nfrom experimental density distributions.
