Previous works suggested that the\nSFD roll-over at R* can be the result of extensive collisional grinding in the\nKuiper belt that led to the catastrophic disruption of most bodies with R<R*.\nHere we use a new code to test the effect of collisions in the Kuiper belt. We\nfind that the observed roll-over could indeed be explained by collisional\ngrinding provided that the initial mass in large bodies was much larger than\nthe one in the present Kuiper belt, and was dynamically depleted. In addition\nto the size distribution changes, our code also tracks the effects of\ncollisions on binary systems. We find that it is generally easier to dissolve\nwide binary systems, such as the ones existing in the cold Kuiper belt today,\nthan to catastrophically disrupt objects with R~R*. Thus, the binary survival\nsets important limits on the extent of collisional grinding in the Kuiper belt.\nWe find that the extensive collisional grinding required to produce the SFD\nroll-over at R* would imply a strong gradient of the binary fraction with R and\nseparation, because it is generally easier to dissolve binaries with small\ncomponents and/or those with wide orbits. The expected binary fraction for R<R*\nis <0.1. The present observational data do not show such a gradient. Instead,\nthey suggest a large binary fraction of ~0.4 for R=30-40 km.

As a result,\na receiver that is interested in one of these signals sees the others as\nunwanted interference. This property of the wireless medium is typically viewed\nas a hindrance to reliable communication over a network. However, using a\nrecently developed coding strategy, interference can in fact be harnessed for\nnetwork coding. In a wired network, (linear) network coding refers to each\nintermediate node taking its received packets, computing a linear combination\nover a finite field, and forwarding the outcome towards the destinations. Then,\ngiven an appropriate set of linear combinations, a destination can solve for\nits desired packets. For certain topologies, this strategy can attain\nsignificantly higher throughputs over routing-based strategies. Reliable\nphysical layer network coding takes this idea one step further: using\njudiciously chosen linear error-correcting codes, intermediate nodes in a\nwireless network can directly recover linear combinations of the packets from\nthe observed noisy superpositions of transmitted signals. Starting with some\nsimple examples, this survey explores the core ideas behind this new technique\nand the possibilities it offers for communication over interference-limited\nwireless networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 18:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-01"}

The GEp-II experiment in Jefferson Lab's Hall A measured $R$ at four\n$Q^2$ values in the range 3.5 GeV$^2 \\le Q^2 \\le 5.6$ GeV$^2$. A possible\ndiscrepancy between the originally published GEp-II results and more recent\nmeasurements at higher $Q^2$ motivated a new analysis of the GEp-II data. This\narticle presents the final results of the GEp-II experiment, including details\nof the new analysis, an expanded description of the apparatus and an overview\nof theoretical progress since the original publication. The key result of the\nfinal analysis is a systematic increase in the results for $R$, improving the\nconsistency of the polarization transfer data in the high-$Q^2$ region. This\nincrease is the result of an improved selection of elastic events which largely\nremoves the systematic effect of the inelastic contamination, underestimated by\nthe original analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 18:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2011 17:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2012 00:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 11:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}

To maximise the received\nsignal to noise ratio and subsequent chances of pulse detection, ionospheric\ndispersion must therefore be corrected, and since the high time resolution\nwould require excessive data storage this correction must be made in real time.\nThis requires an accurate knowledge of the dispersion characteristic which is\nparameterised by the instantaneous Total Electron Content (TEC) of the\nionosphere.

We find that the net baryonic accretion rates through the\nvirial radius are sensitive to galactic outflows and explore a range of outflow\nparameters to illustrate the effects. We show that the cold gas accretion rate\nis in general not a simple universal factor of the dark matter accretion rate,\nand that galactic winds can cause star formation rates to deviate significantly\nfrom the external gas accretion rates, both via gas ejection and re-accretion.\nFurthermore, galactic winds can inject enough energy and momentum in the\nsurrounding medium to slow down accretion altogether, especially in low-mass\nhalos and at low redshift. By resolving the accretion rates versus radius from\nthe halo centers, we show how cold streams penetrate the hot atmospheres of\nmassive halos at z>2, but gradually disappear at lower redshift. The total\nbaryon mass fraction is also strongly suppressed by outflows in low-mass halos,\nbut is nearly universal in the absence of feedback in halos above the UV\nbackground suppression scale. The transition halo mass, at which the gas mass\nin halos is equal for the cold and hot components, is roughly constant at\n~10^11.5 Msun and does not depend sensitively on the wind prescription. We\nprovide simple fitting formulae for the cold gas accretion rate into halos in\nthe no-wind case. Finally, we show that cold accretion is broadly consistent\nwith driving the bulk of the highly star-forming galaxies observed at z~2, but\nthat the more intense star formers likely sample the high end of the accretion\nrate distribution, and may be additionally fueled by a combination of gas\nrecycling, gas re-accretion, hot mode cooling, and mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 23:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The aim of the present work is to quantify the mass-loss\nrates (dm/dt), heating efficiencies (eta), and lifetimes for the whole sample\nof transiting exoplanets, now including hot jupiters, hot neptunes, and hot\nsuper-earths. The mass-loss rates and lifetimes are estimated from an \"energy\ndiagram\" for exoplanets, which compares the planet gravitational potential\nenergy to the stellar X/EUV energy deposited in the atmosphere.

Aims: The aim of the reported work is to\nmeasure the eclipse depth of the planet HAT-P-1b at 2.2micron. This planet is\nan interesting case, since the amount of stellar irradiation it receives falls\nin between that of the two best studied systems (HD209458 and HD189733), and it\nhas been suggested to have a weak thermal inversion layer. Methods: We have\nused the LIRIS instrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) to observe\nthe secondary eclipse of HATP-1b in the Ks-band, as part of our Ground-based\nsecondary eclipse (GROUSE) project. The observations were done in staring mode,\nwhile significantly defocusing the telescope to avoid saturation on the K=8.4\nstar. With an average cadence of 2.5 seconds, we collected 6520 frames during\none night. Results: The eclipse is detected at the 4sigma level, the measured\ndepth being 0.109+/-0.025%. The uncertainties are dominated by residual\nsystematic effects, as estimated from different reduction/analysis procedures.\nThe measured depth corresponds to a brightness temperature of 2136+150-170K.\nThis brightness temperature is significantly higher than those derived from\nlonger wavelengths, making it difficult to fit all available data points with a\nplausible atmospheric model. However, it may be that we underestimate the true\nuncertainties of our measurements, since it is notoriously difficult to assign\nprecise statistical significance to a result when systematic effects are\nimportant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 21:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

All of these\nproblems consistently indicate that observed galaxy clusters may be\ngravitational lenses stronger than expected.

The\nplasma travels at the velocity of the molecular beam, and, on passing through a\ngrounded grid, yields an electron time-of-flight signal that gauges the plasma\nsize and quantity of trapped electrons. This plasma expands at a rate that fits\nwith an electron temperature as low as 5 K, colder that typically observed for\natomic ultracold plasmas. The recombination of molecular NO$^+$ cations with\nelectrons forms neutral molecules excited by more than twice the energy of the\nNO chemical bond, and the question arises whether neutral fragmentation plays a\nrole in shaping the redistribution of energy and particle density that directs\nthe short-time evolution from Rydberg gas to plasma. To explore this question,\nwe adapt a coupled rate-equations model established for atomic ultracold\nplasmas to describe the energy-grained avalanche of electron-Rydberg and\nelectron-ion collisions in our system. Adding channels of Rydberg\npredissociation and two-body, electron- cation dissociative recombination to\nthe atomic formalism, we investigate the kinetics by which this relaxation\ndistributes particle density and energy over Rydberg states, free electrons and\nneutral fragments. The results of this investigation suggest some mechanisms by\nwhich molecular fragmentation channels can affect the state of the plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 23:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We study the evolution\nof the physical quantities relevant to quantitative description of the early\nuniverse, namely, the energy density, temperature and the scale factor before,\nduring, and after the phase transition.

We find that in the paramagnetic state,\nphonons are scattered by the magnetic excitations above certain temperature Ts,\nwhich corresponds to a gap.

In the framework of\nthe Chandra Carina Complex Project, 129 O and B stars have been detected as\nX-ray sources; 78 of those, all with spectral type earlier than B3, have enough\ncounts for at least a rough X-ray spectral characterization. This leads to an\nestimate of the Lx/Lbol ratio for an exceptional number of 60 O stars belonging\nto the same region and triples the number of Carina massive stars studied\nspectroscopically in X-rays. The derived log(Lx/Lbol) is -7.26 for single\nobjects, with a dispersion of only 0.21dex. Using the properties of hot massive\nstars listed in the literature, we compare the X-ray luminosities of different\ntypes of objects. In the case of O stars, the Lx/Lbol ratios are similar for\nbright and faint objects, as well as for stars of different luminosity classes\nor spectral types. Binaries appear only slightly harder and slightly more\nluminous in X-rays than single objects; the differences are not formally\nsignificant (at the 1% level), except for the Lx/Lbol ratio in the medium\n(1.0--2.5keV) energy band. Weak-wind objects have similar X-ray luminosities\nbut they display slightly softer spectra compared to \"normal\" O stars with the\nsame bolometric luminosity. Discarding three overluminous objects, we find a\nvery shallow trend of harder emission in brighter objects. The properties of\nthe few B stars bright enough to yield some spectral information appear to be\ndifferent overall (constant X-ray luminosities, harder spectra), hinting that\nanother mechanism for producing X-rays, besides wind shocks, might be at work.\nHowever, it must be stressed that the earliest and X-ray brightest amongst\nthese few detected objects are similar to the latest O stars, suggesting a\npossibly smooth transition between the two processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2011 08:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel multi-label learning method \"Structured Decomposition\n+ Group Sparsity (SDGS)\". In SDGS, we learn a feature subspace for each label\nfrom the structured decomposition of the training data, and predict the labels\nof a new sample from its group sparse representation on the multi-subspace\nobtained from the structured decomposition. In particular, in the training\nstage, we decompose the data matrix $X\\in R^{n\\times p}$ as\n$X=\\sum_{i=1}^kL^i+S$, wherein the rows of $L^i$ associated with samples that\nbelong to label $i$ are nonzero and consist a low-rank matrix, while the other\nrows are all-zeros, the residual $S$ is a sparse matrix. The row space of $L_i$\nis the feature subspace corresponding to label $i$. This decomposition can be\nefficiently obtained via randomized optimization.

The\nmodeling flexibility of hypergraphs however, comes at a cost: algorithms on\nhypergraphs are inherently more complicated than those on graphs, which\nsometimes translate to nontrivial increases in processing times. Neither the\nmodeling flexibility of hypergraphs, nor the runtime efficiency of graph\nalgorithms can be overlooked. Therefore, the new research thrust should be how\nto cleverly trade-off between the two. This work addresses one method for this\ntrade-off by solving the hypergraph partitioning problem by finding vertex\nseparators on graphs. Specifically, we investigate how to solve the hypergraph\npartitioning problem by seeking a vertex separator on its net intersection\ngraph (NIG), where each net of the hypergraph is represented by a vertex, and\ntwo vertices share an edge if their nets have a common vertex. We propose a\nvertex-weighting scheme to attain good node-balanced hypergraphs, since NIG\nmodel cannot preserve node balancing information.

In addition, several interesting\nissues concerning EEHG simulation are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2011 09:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 16:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-03"}

The introduction of a quantum-controlled device (i.e., quantum\nbeamsplitter) has several consequences. First, it implies that we can measure\ncomplementary phenomena with a single experimental setup, thus pointing to a\nredefinition of complementarity principle. Second, a quantum control allows us\nto prove there are no consistent hidden-variable theories in which \"particle\"\nand \"wave\" are realistic properties. Finally, it shows that a photon can have a\nmorphing behaviour between \"particle\" and \"wave\"; this further supports the\nconclusion that \"particle\" and \"wave\" are not realistic properties but merely\nreflect how we 'look' at the photon.

We also analyze certain key properties exhibited by our\nneighbor oblivious link reversal algorithms, e.g., for any two neighbors, their\nt-states are always consecutive integers, and for any node, its t-state size is\nupper bounded by log(N). In the second step, we resolve the integer overflow\nproblem by analytically deriving one-bit full link reversal and two-bit partial\nlink reversal versions of our neighbor oblivious link reversal algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2011 11:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 13:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-07"}

This new image, combined with Hubble Space Telescope /\nAdvanced Camera for Surveys F606W-band polarimetric images, shows that the\nbinary has complicated circumbinary features, including a circumbinary disk,\nwestern and eastern arm-like structures, and two cavities at the northeast and\nsouthwest. The circumbinary disk is 630 AU in radius and the southeast side of\nthe disk is bright in the H-band. The brightness ratio (southeast/northwest) is\n1.6. A single Rayleigh-like scattering model indicates that the disk is\ninclined by 30 degree to 40 degree and that the southeast side corresponds to\nthe near side along our line of sight. The H-band surface brightness of the\nsoutheast side decreases as r^(-1.9) from 15.2 mag arcsec^-2 to 16.8 mag\narcsec^-2. The outer portion of the disk is possibly more flared than its inner\nportion. The weak centro-symmetric polarization pattern and redder F606W-H\ncolor (4.2 mag) of the southeast side are probably caused by multiple\nscattering events from the dust grains associated with the binary. The\nF606W-band image shows the bright northwest side of the disk in contrast with\nthe H-band image. The F606W-H color of the northwest side is between 1.7 mag\nand 3.0 mag. We consider that Haro 6-5 B (FS Tauri B), 20\" away, produces the\nneutral scattered light from the northwest side. This idea is supported by the\npolarization pattern of the northwest side, which is centro-symmetric with\nrespect to Haro 6-5 B. The arms appear to encompass the western and eastern\ncavities, suggesting that the arms + cavity systems are created by a bipolar\noutflow from the binary. However, the direction of this outflow is inconsistent\nwith that of outflows inferred from the circumbinary disk model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2011 12:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The generators for rotations and boosts\nalong an arbitrary direction, as well as their commutation relations, are\nwritten as functions of the unit vectors that define the axis of rotation or\nthe direction of the boost (an approach that can be compared with the one that\nin electrodynamics, works with the electric and magnetic fields instead of the\nMaxwell stress tensor). For finite values of the angle of rotation or the\nboost's velocity, collectively denoted by V, the existence of an exponential\nexpansion for the coordinate transformation's matrix, M (in terms of GV where G\nis the generator) requires that the matrix's derivative with respect to V, be\nequal to GM. This condition can only be satisfied if the transformation is\nadditive as it is indeed the case for rotations, but not for velocities. If it\nis assumed, however, that for boosts such an expansion exists, with V = V(v), v\nbeing the velocity, and if the above condition is imposed on the boost's matrix\nthen its expression in terms of hyperbolic cosh(V) and sinh(V} is recovered,\nand the expression for V(= arc tanh(v)) is determined. A general Lorentz\ntransformation can be written as an exponential containing the sum of a\nrotation and a boost, which to first order is equal to the product of a boost\nwith a rotation. The calculations of the second and third order terms show that\nthe equations for the generators used in this paper, allow to reliably infer\nthe expressions for the higher order generators, without having recourse to the\ncommutation relations. The transformationmatrices for Weyl spinors are derived\nfor finite values of the rotation and velocity, and field representations,\nleading to the expression for the angular momentum operator, are studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2011 12:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 05:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2011 11:02:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 04:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 13:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-12"}

A time lag of $\\sim$ 30 days between\noptical and infrared light curves has been measured and interpreted in the\nframework of an accretion event.

Previous analyses of\nradial velocity and transit timing data of the system suggested that the\nobservational constraints on the orbital states were rather small. We reanalyze\nthe available data, treating the jitter as an unknown MCMC parameter, and find\nthat a wide range of jitter values are plausible, hence the system parameters\nare less well constrained than previously suggested. For slightly increased\nlevels of jitter ($\\sim 4.5\\,m\\,s^{-1}$) the eccentricity of the inner planet\ncan be in the range $0<e_{inner}<0.07$, the period and eccentricity of the\nouter planet can be $440<P_{outer}<470$ days and $0.55<e_{outer}<0.85$\nrespectively, while the relative pericenter alignment, $\\eta$, of the planets\ncan take essentially any value $-180^{\\circ}<\\eta<+180^{\\circ}$. It is\ntherefore difficult to determine whether $e_{inner}$ and $\\eta$ have evolved to\na fixed-point state or a limit cycle, or to use $e_{inner}$ to probe the\ninternal planetary structure. We perform various transit timing variation (TTV)\nanalyses, demonstrating that current constraints merely restrict\n$e_{outer}<0.85$, and rule out relative planetary inclinations within $\\sim\n2^{\\circ}$ of $i_{rel}=90^{\\circ}$, but that future observations could\nsignificantly tighten the restriction on both these parameters. We demonstrate\nthat TTV profiles can readily distinguish the theoretically favored\ninclinations of $i_{rel}=0^{\\circ}\\,&\\,45^{\\circ}$, provided that sufficiently\nprecise and frequent transit timing observations of HAT-P-13b can be made close\nto the pericenter passage of HAT-P-13c. We note the relatively high probability\nthat HAT-P-13c transits and suggest observational dates and strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2011 15:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-02"}

Clusters are\ntypically modeled as spherical systems whose intracluster gas is in strict\nhydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., the equilibrium gas pressure is provided\nentirely by thermal pressure), with the gravitational field dominated by dark\nmatter, assumptions that are only rough approximations. In fact, numerical\nsimulations indicate that galaxy clusters are typically triaxial, rather than\nspherical, and that turbulent gas motions (induced during hierarchical merger\nevents) provide an appreciable pressure component. Extending our previous work,\nwe present results of a joint analysis of X-ray, weak and strong lensing\nmeasurements of Abell 1689. The quality of the data allows us to determine both\nthe triaxial shape of the cluster and the level of non-thermal pressure that is\nrequired if the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium.
