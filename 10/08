The\nstand-alone imaging atmospheric Cherenkov MAGIC telescope, and later on the\nrecently inaugurated stereoscopic system, made a significant effort to search\nfor signals from microquasars. This paper reviews all MAGIC results of Cygnus\nX-3, Cygnus X-1, Scorpius X-1, and SS 433 observations. The stand-alone MAGIC\ntelescope observed Cygnus X-3 for almost 60 hrs from March 2006 until August\n2009 in many different X-ray spectral states where a very high energy emission\nis predicted and also simultaneously with a flux enhancement at high energies\ndetected by Fermi/LAT. No significant signal was found in any of the observed\nconditions. The MAGIC stereoscopic system pointed at the Z-type low-mass X-ray\nbinary Scorpius X-1 in May 2010 for ~8 hrs. Simultaneous soft X-ray\nmeasurements allowed to define the X-ray spectral state of the source which\ncould emit very-high-energy photons in the horizontal branch. MAGIC did not\ndetect the source and put some constraints on the maximum TeV luminosity to jet\npower ratio.

The observed solar fluctuations significantly\nexceed the noise and range from 0.3% at 3130 {\\AA}, 0.05% at 34000 {\\AA}, to\n0.06% at 46700 {\\AA} near disk center. These fluctuations (corresponding to\nabout 3 K) presumably arise from the incomplete averaging of granulation.\nStandard solar models for limb darkening fit the data for true continuum\nregions reasonably well. No significant differences are seen between scan\ndirections (EW, N-S). Perhaps our results can serve as a template for exoplanet\ndetection by the transit of quiet G2V-like stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2011 17:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-10"}

A constant opposing voltage is required to deplete the charges from\nthe defect states. Our experimental results exclude the possibility of\ndiffusion of the metal electrodes or oxygen vacancies into the LaAlO3 layer.\nInstead, the phenomenon is attributed to the formation of a quasi-conduction\nband (QCB) in the defect states of LaAlO3 that forms a continuum state with the\nconduction band of the Nb-SrTiO3.

We find that\nfermions rapidly develop a finite quasi steady-state current reminiscent of\nelectronic transport in nanoscale systems. This result is robust -- it occurs\nwith or without a harmonic confining potential and at zero or finite\ntemperature. The zero-temperature bosonic current instead exhibits strong\noscillatory behavior that decays into a steady-state of zero current only in\nthe thermodynamic limit. These differences appear most strikingly in the\ndifferent particle number fluctuations on half of the lattice as a consequence\nof the spin statistics.

The motivation\noriginates from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where a multiple\nmixture NMR spectra are recorded to identify chemical compounds with similar\nstructures. Consider the linear mixing model (LMM), we aim to identify the\nchemical compounds involved when the mixing process is known to be nearly\nsingular. We first consider a class of data with dominant interval(s) (DI)\nwhere each of source signals has dominant peaks over others. Besides, a nearly\nsingular mixing process produces degenerate mixtures. The DI condition implies\nclustering structures in the data points. Hence, the estimation of the mixing\nmatrix could be achieved by data clustering. Due to the presence of the noise\nand the degeneracy of the data, a small deviation in the estimation may\nintroduce errors in the output. To resolve this problem and improve robustness\nof the separation, methods are developed in two aspects. One is to find better\nestimation of the mixing matrix by allowing a constrained perturbation to the\nclustering output, and it can be achieved by a quadratic programming. The other\nis to seek sparse source signals by exploiting the DI condition, and it solves\nan $\\ell_1$ optimization. If no source information is available, we propose to\nadopt the nonnegative matrix factorization approach by incorporating the matrix\nstructure (parallel columns of the mixing matrix) into the cost function and\ndevelop multiplicative iteration rules for the numerical solutions.

Despite varying expression of genes, down regulation of pro- and\nanti-apoptotic genes was observed in these cells. Conclusion: Based upon this\ninvestigation, it can be concluded that CBX could affect both low and high\nproliferative types of breast cancer cell lines and disproportionate down\nregulation of both pre- and anti-apoptotic genes may be related to interacting\nbiomolecules, perhaps via gap junctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2011 07:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}

In this letter, we present experimental results based on\na large set of time series on futures. We show that the t-distribution with\n$\\nu \\simeq 3$ gives a nice description of almost all data series considered\nfor a time scale $\\Delta t$ below 1 hour. For $\\Delta t \\ge 8$ hours, the\nGaussian regime is reached. A particular focus has been put on the DAX and Euro\nfutures. This appears to be a quite general result that stays robust on a large\nset of futures, but not on any data sets. In this sense, this is not universal.\nA technique using factorial moments defined on a sequence of returns is\ndescribed and similar results for time scales are obtained. Let us note that\nfrom a fundamental point of view, there is no clear reason why DAX and Euro\nfutures should present similar behavior with respect to their return\ndistributions. Both are complex markets where many internal and external\nfactors interact at each instant to determine the transaction price. These\nfactors are certainly different for an index on a change parity (Euro) and an\nindex on stocks (DAX). Thus, this is striking that we can identify universal\nstatistical features in price fluctuations of these markets.

To provide cloud\ncomputing services economically, it is important to optimize resource\nallocation under the assumption that the required resource can be taken from a\nshared resource pool. In addition, to be able to provide processing ability and\nstorage capacity, it is necessary to allocate bandwidth to access them at the\nsame time.\n  This paper proposes an optimal resource allocation method for cloud computing\nenvironments. First, this paper develops a resource allocation model of cloud\ncomputing environments, assuming both processing ability and bandwidth are\nallocated simultaneously to each service request and rented out on an hourly\nbasis. The allocated resources are dedicated to each service request. Next,\nthis paper proposes an optimal joint multiple resource allocation method, based\non the above resource allocation model. It is demonstrated by simulation\nevaluation that the proposed method can reduce the request loss probability and\nas a result, reduce the total resource required, compared with the conventional\nallocation method. Then, this paper defines basic principles and a measure for\nachieving fair resource allocation among multiple users in a cloud computing\nenvironment, and proposes a fair joint multiple resource allocation method.

Then we constructed the\nmotivic Hirzebruch class transformation in the algebraic context for k of\ncharacteristic zero and in the compact complex analytic context. It unifies the\nwell-known three characteristic class transformations of singular varieties:\nMacPherson's Chern class, Baum-Fulton-MacPherson's Todd class and the L-class\nof Goresky-MacPherson and Cappell-Shaneson. In this paper we construct a\nbivariant relative Grothendieck group K_0(V/-) and in the algebraic context (in\nany characteristic) two Grothendieck transformations mC_y resp. T_y defined on\nK_0(V/-). Evaluating at y=0, we get a motivic lift T_0 of Fulton-MacPherson's\nbivariant Riemann-Roch transformation. The associated covariant transformations\nagree for k of characteristic zero with our motivic Chern- and Hirzebruch class\ntransformations defined on K_0(V/X). Finally, evaluating at y=-1, we get for k\nof characteristic zero, a motivic lift T_{-1} of Ernstr\\\"om-Yokura's bivariant\nChern class transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2011 10:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 07:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}
