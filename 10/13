As a classical solution to the\nmatrix model, we find a novel quantized geometry characterized by a quantum\nNambu 3-bracket. Infinite dimensional representations of the quantum Nambu\ngeometry are constructed which demonstrate that the quantum Nambu geometry is\nintrinsically different from the ordinary Lie algebra type noncommutative\ngeometry. Matrix models for the IIB string, IIA string and M-theory in the\ncorresponding backgrounds are constructed. A classical solution of a quantum\nNambu geometry in the IIA Matrix string theory gives rise to an expansion of\nthe fundamental strings into a system of multiple D4-branes and the fluctuation\nis found to describe an action for a non-abelian 3-form field strength which is\na natural non-abelian generalization of the PST action for a single D4-brane.\nIn view of the recent proposals of the M5-branes theory in terms of the\nD4-branes, we suggest a natural way to include all the KK modes and propose an\naction for the the multiple M5-branes in a constant C-field. The worldvolume of\nthe M5-branes in a C-field is found to be described by a quantum Nambu geometry\nwith self-dual parameters. It is intriguing that our action is naturally\nformulated in terms of a 1-form gauge field living on a six dimensional quantum\nNambu geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 16:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Even in a single formalism, several variants are often proposed to\nmodel different types of uncertainty (probability, possibility...) or utility\n(additive or not). In this article, we introduce an algebraic graphical model\nthat encompasses a large number of such formalisms: (1) we first adapt previous\nstructures from Friedman, Chu and Halpern for representing uncertainty,\nutility, and expected utility in order to deal with generic forms of sequential\ndecision making; (2) on these structures, we then introduce composite graphical\nmodels that express information via variables linked by \"local\" functions,\nthanks to conditional independence; (3) on these graphical models, we finally\ndefine a simple class of queries which can represent various scenarios in terms\nof observabilities and controllabilities. A natural decision-tree semantics for\nsuch queries is completed by an equivalent operational semantics, which induces\ngeneric algorithms. The proposed framework, called the\nPlausibility-Feasibility-Utility (PFU) framework, not only provides a better\nunderstanding of the links between existing formalisms, but it also covers yet\nunpublished frameworks (such as possibilistic influence diagrams) and unifies\nformalisms such as quantified boolean formulas and influence diagrams.

We\nuse the far-infrared data from the Improved Reprocessing of the IRAS Survey and\nthe V-band extinction image provided by the COMPLETE Survey to estimate the\ndust column density image of Perseus. In combination with the HI data from the\nGalactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI Survey and an estimate of the local\ndust-to-gas ratio, we then derive the Sigma_H2 distribution across Perseus. We\nfind a relatively uniform Sigma_HI ~ 6-8 Msun pc^-2 for both dark and\nstar-forming regions, suggesting a minimum HI surface density required to\nshield H2 against photodissociation. As a result, a remarkably tight and\nconsistent relation is found between Sigma_H2/Sigma_HI and Sigma_HI+Sigma_H2.\nThe transition between the HI- and H2-dominated regions occurs at N(HI)+2N(H2)\n~ (8-14) x 10^20 cm^-2. Our findings are consistent with predictions for H2\nformation in equilibrium, suggesting that turbulence may not be of primary\nimportance for H2 formation. However, the importance of a warm neutral medium\nfor H2 shielding, an internal radiation field, and the timescale of H2\nformation still remain as open questions. We also compare H2 and CO\ndistributions and estimate the fraction of \"CO-dark\" gas, f_DG ~ 0.3. While\nsignificant spatial variations of f_DG are found, we do not find a clear\ncorrelation with the mean V-band extinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 18:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 04:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The majority of non-STEM\nstudents can be classified as either concrete operational or transitional\nreasoners in Piaget's theory of cognitive development, whereas in the STEM\npopulation formal operational reasoners are far more prevalent. In particular,\nnon-STEM students demonstrate significant difficulty with proportional and\nhypothetico-deductive reasoning. Pre-scores on the LCTSR are correlated with\nnormalized learning gains on various concept inventories. The correlation is\nstrongest for content that can be categorized as mostly theoretical, meaning a\nlack of directly observable exemplars, and weakest for content categorized as\nmostly descriptive, where directly observable exemplars are abundant. Although\nthe implementation of research-verified, interactive engagement pedagogy can\nlead to gains in content knowledge, significant gains in theoretical content\n(such as force and energy) are more difficult with non-STEM students. We also\nobserve no significant gains on the LCTSR without explicit instruction in\nscientific reasoning patterns. These results further demonstrate that\ndifferences in student populations are important when comparing normalized\ngains on concept inventories, and the achievement of significant gains in\nscientific reasoning requires a re-evaluation of the traditional approach to\nphysics for non-STEM students.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 19:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We then illustrate this method by\nconstructing a new class of geometries describing several parallel spirals\ncarrying D1, D5 and P charge and parameterized by four arbitrary functions of\none variable. A similar linear structure is known to exist in five dimensions,\nwhere it underlies the black hole, black ring and corresponding microstate\ngeometries.

A\nmulti-wavelength analysis on Extremely Red Galaxy populations is first\npresented in one of the most intensively observed patch of the sky, the Chandra\nDeep Field South. By adopting a purely statistical methodology, we consider all\nthe photometric and spectroscopic information available on large samples of\nExtremely Red Objects (EROs, 553 sources), IRAC EROs (IEROs, 259 sources), and\nDistant Red Galaxies (DRGs, 289 sources).

The results point to\nthe fact that EROs, IEROs, and DRGs all belong to the same population, yet seen\nat different phases of galaxy evolution. The second part of this thesis is\ndedicated to the AGN selection in the IR, with particular relevance to the\nJames Webb Space Telescope, to be launched in 2018. We develop an improved IR\ncriterion (using K and IRAC bands) as an alternative to existing IR AGN\ncriteria for the z<2.5 regime, and develop another IR criterion which reliably\nselects AGN hosts at 0<z<7 (using K, Spitzer-IRAC, and Spitzer-MIPS24um bands,\nKIM).

A\nproblem from VCSP is characterised by a \\emph{constraint language}, a fixed set\nof cost functions over a finite domain.

In the case of languages consisting of only $\\{0,\\infty\\}$-valued\ncost functions (i.e. relations), such languages have been called\n\\emph{conservative} and studied by Bulatov [LICS'03] and recently by Barto\n[LICS'11]. Since we study valued languages, we call a language conservative if\nit contains all finite-valued unary cost functions.

Request-I calls for very dense dark matter medium\nand the critical density sensitively depends on the residual surface\ntemperature of the very old compact objects. The accretion of\ninterstellar/intracluster medium onto the compact objects is governed by the\nphysical properties of the medium and by the magnetization and rotation of the\nstars and may outshine the signal of dark matter annihilation.

One of such features concerns large rare\nexcursions far from the stable state in the space of dynamical variables. For\nequilibrium systems, the most probable fluctuational trajectory to a given\nstate is related to the fluctuation-free trajectory back to the stable state by\ntime reversal. This is no longer true for nonequilibrium systems, where the\npattern of the most probable trajectories generally displays singularities.\nHere we study how the singularities emerge as the system is driven away from\nequilibrium, and whether a driving strength threshold is required for their\nonset. Using a resonantly modulated oscillator as a model, we identify two\ndistinct scenarios, depending on the speed of the optimal path in thermal\nequilibrium. If the position away from the stable state along the optimal path\ngrows exponentially in time, the singularities emerge without a threshold. We\nfind the scaling of the location of the singularities as a function of the\ncontrol parameter.

Triaxiality and orientation biases might be at the origin of this\ndisagreement, as clusters elongated along the line-of-sight would have a\nrelatively higher projected mass density, boosting the resulting lensing\nproperties. Analyses of statistical samples can probe further these effects and\ncrucially reduce biases. In this work we perform a fully triaxial\nstrong-lensing analysis of the 12 MACS clusters at z > 0.5, a complete X-ray\nselected sample, and fully account for the impact of the intrinsic 3D shapes on\ntheir strong lensing properties. We first construct strong-lensing mass models\nfor each cluster based on multiple-images, and fit projected ellipsoidal\nNavarro-Frenk-White halos with arbitrary orientations to each mass\ndistribution. We then invert the measured surface mass densities using Bayesian\nstatistics. Although the Einstein radii of this sample are significantly larger\nthan predicted by LambdaCDM, here we find that the mass-concentration relation\nis in full agreement with results from N-body simulations. The z > 0.5 MACS\nclusters suffer from a moderate form of orientation bias as may be expected for\nX-ray selected samples. Being mostly unrelaxed, at a relatively high redshift,\nwith high X-ray luminosity and noticeable substructures, these clusters may lie\noutside the standard concentration-Einstein radius relation. Our results remark\nthe importance of triaxiality and properly selected samples for understanding\ngalaxy clusters properties, and suggest that higher-z, unrelaxed\nlow-concentration clusters form a different class of prominent strong\ngravitational lenses. Arc redshift confirmation and weak lensing data in the\nouter region are needed to further refine our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 07:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

These measurements are necessary to determine the\nabsolute cross-sections of reaction processes and are valuable to quantify the\nperformance of the accelerator. Using data taken in 2010, LHCb has applied two\nmethods to determine the absolute scale of its luminosity measurements for\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. In\naddition to the classic \"van der Meer scan\" method a novel technique has been\ndeveloped which makes use of direct imaging of the individual beams using\nbeam-gas and beam-beam interactions.

This framework, termed Particle Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (PMCMC), was shown to provide powerful methods for joint\nBayesian state and parameter inference in nonlinear/non-Gaussian state-space\nmodels. However, the mixing of the resulting MCMC kernels can be quite\nsensitive, both to the number of particles used in the underlying PF and to the\nnumber of observations in the data. In the discussion following (Andrieu et\nal., 2010), Whiteley suggested a modified version of one of the PMCMC samplers,\nnamely the particle Gibbs (PG) sampler, and argued that this should improve its\nmixing. In this paper we explore the consequences of this modification and show\nthat it leads to a method which is much more robust to a low number of\nparticles as well as a large number of observations.

Here, we provide direct experimental evidence of long-range\ncorrelations during the deformation of a dense colloidal glass. By imposing an\nexternal stress, we force structural rearrangements that make the glass flow,\nand we identify long-range correlations in the fluctuations of microscopic\nstrain, and elucidate their scaling and spatial symmetry. The applied shear\ninduces a transition from homogeneous to inhomogeneous flow at a critical shear\nrate, and we investigate the role of strain correlations in this transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 10:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

It\nalso provides insights into the complex solar magnetism. Variations in the mean\nstrength of the solar magnetic field lead to significant shifts in the\nfrequencies of even the lowest-degree p modes with high levels of correlation\nwith surface activity proxies. These frequency shifts are explained to arise\nfrom structural changes in the outer layers of the Sun during the 11-year\nactivity cycle, which is understood to be driven by a dynamo process. However,\nclear differences between p-mode frequencies and surface activity during the\nextended minimum of cycle 23 were observed. The origin of the p-mode\nvariability is thus far from being properly understood and a better\ncomprehension of its relationship with solar and stellar activity cycles will\nhelp us in our understanding of the dynamo processes. Spectroscopic\nmeasurements of Ca H and K emission lines revealed magnetic activity variations\nin a large sample of solar-type stars with timescales ranging from 2.5 and 25\nyears. This broad range of cycle periods is thought to reflect differences in\nthe rotational properties and the depths of the surface convection zones with\nvarious masses and ages. However, spectroscopic measurements are only good\nproxies of surface magnetic fields. The recent discovery of variations with\nmagnetic activity in the p-mode frequencies of the solar-like star HD 49933\nobserved by CoRoT, with a frequency dependence comparable in shape to the one\nobserved in the Sun, opens a new era in the study of the physical phenomena\ninvolved in the dynamo processes. Current and future asteroseismic observations\nwill contribute to probe stellar cycles in a wide variety of solar-type stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 10:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-14"}

During high\nstate phases, the high-frequency SSC component often dominates the\nlow-frequency synchrotron component, implying that the inverse Compton SSC\nlosses of electrons are at least equal to or greater than the synchrotron\nlosses of electrons. We calculate from the analytical solution of the kinetic\nequation of relativistic electrons, subject to the combined linear synchrotron\nand nonlinear synchrotron self-Compton cooling, for monoenergetic injection the\ntime-integrated total synchrotron and SSC radiation fluences and spectral\nenergy distributions (SED). Depending on the ratio of the initial cooling\nterms, displayed by the injection parameter $\\alpha$, we find for $\\alpha\\ll\n1$, implying complete linear cooling, that the synchrotron peak dominates the\ninverse Compton peak and the usual results of the spectra are recovered. For\n$\\alpha\\gg 1$ the SSC peak dominates the synchrotron peak, proving our\nassumption that in such a case the cooling becomes initially non-linear. The\nspectra also show some unique features, which can be attributed directly to the\nnon-linear cooling. To show the potential of the model, we apply it to\noutbursts of 3C 279 and 3C 454.3, successfully reproducing the SEDs. The\nresults of our analysis are promising, and we argue that this non-equilibrium\nmodel should be considered in future modeling attempts for blazar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 12:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Here, for the first time, we apply\nthe technique of optimal estimation to determine the thermal structure and\ncomposition of an exoplanet by solving the inverse problem. The development of\na suite of radiative transfer and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is\ndescribed, building upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the\nstudy of our own solar system. First, we discuss the plausibility of detection\nof different molecules in the dayside atmosphere of HD 189733b and the\nbest-fitting spectrum retrieved from all publicly available sets of secondary\neclipse observations between 1.45 and 24 {\\mu}m. Additionally, we use\ncontribution functions to assess the vertical sensitivity of the emission\nspectrum to temperatures and molecular composition. Over the altitudes probed\nby the contribution functions, the retrieved thermal structure shows an\nisothermal upper atmosphere overlying a deeper adiabatic layer (temperature\ndecreasing with altitude), which is consistent with previously-reported\ndynamical and observational results. The formal uncertainties on retrieved\nparameters are estimated conservatively using an analysis of the\ncross-correlation functions and the degeneracy between different atmospheric\nproperties. The formal solution of the inverse problem suggests that the\nuncertainties on retrieved parameters are larger than suggested in previous\nstudies, and that the presence of CO and CH4 is only marginally supported by\nthe available data.

Yet in finite asexual populations, purifying selection\ncannot completely prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to\nMuller's ratchet: once lost by stochastic drift, the most-fit class of\ngenotypes is lost forever. If deleterious mutations are weakly selected,\nMuller's ratchet turns into a mutational \"meltdown\" leading to a rapid\ndegradation of population fitness. Evidently, the long term stability of an\nasexual population requires an influx of beneficial mutations that continuously\ncompensate for the accumulation of the weakly deleterious ones. Here we propose\nthat the stable evolutionary state of a population in a static environment is a\ndynamic mutation-selection balance, where accumulation of deleterious mutations\nis on average offset by the influx of beneficial mutations. We argue that this\nstate exists for any population size N and mutation rate $U$.

It introduces a\nnovel approach of analyzing distance-dependent probabilities of collaboration.\nThe results of the analysis of six distinct scientific fields reveal that\nintra-country collaboration is about 10-50 times more likely to occur than\ninternational collaboration. Moreover, strong dependencies exist between\ncollaboration activity (measured in co-authorships) and spatial distance when\nconfined to national borders. However, the fact that distance becomes\nirrelevant once collaboration is taken to the international scale suggests a\nglobalized science system that is strongly influenced by the gravity of local\nscience clusters. The similarity of the probability functions of the six\nscience fields analyzed suggests a universal mode of spatial governance that is\nindependent from the mode of knowledge creation in science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 15:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

After a short introduction to the topic and an\nhistorical overview, the properties of cosmic rays are discussed with respect\nto different energy ranges. The origin and the propagation of nuclei in the\nGalaxy are dealt with from a theoretical point of view. The mechanisms leading\nto the acceleration of nuclei by supernova remnants and to their subsequent\ndiffusion through the inhomogeneities of the galactic magnetic field are\ndiscussed and some clue is given on the predictions and observations of fluxes\nof antimatter, both from astrophysical sources and from dark matter\nannihilation in the galactic halo. The experimental techniques and\ninstrumentations employed for the detection of cosmic rays at Earth are\ndescribed. Direct methods are viable up to 10^14 eV, by means of experiments\nflown on balloons or satellites, while above that energy, due to their very low\nflux, cosmic rays can be studied only indirectly by exploiting the particle\ncascades they produce in the atmosphere. The possible physical interpretation\nof the peculiar features observed in the energy spectrum of galactic cosmic\nrays, and in particular the so-called \"knee\" at about 4x10^15 eV, are\ndiscussed. A section is devoted to the region between about 10^18 and 10^19 eV,\nwhich is believed to host the transition between galactic and extragalactic\ncosmic rays. The conclusion gives some perspectives on the cosmic ray\nastrophysics field. Thanks to a wealth of different experiments, this research\narea is living a very flourishing era. The activity is exciting both from the\ntheoretical and the instrumental sides, and its interconnection with astronomy,\nastrophysics and particle physics experiences non-stop growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 15:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-24"}

The selection of the twist\npitch lengths has major implications for the performance of the cable in the\ncase of strain sensitive superconductors, i.e. Nb3Sn, as the electromagnetic\nand thermal contraction loads are large but also for the heat load from the AC\ncoupling loss. Reduction of the transverse load and warm-up cool-down\ndegradation can be reached by applying longer twist pitches in a particular\nsequence for the sub-stages, offering a large cable transverse stiffness,\nadequate axial flexibility and maximum allowed lateral strand support. Analysis\nof short sample (TF conductor) data reveals that increasing the twist pitch can\nlead to a gain of the effective axial compressive strain of more than 0.3 %\nwith practically no degradation from bending. For reduction of the coupling\nloss, specific choices of the cabling twist sequence are needed with the aim to\nminimize the area of linked strands and bundles that are coupled and form loops\nwith the applied changing magnetic field, instead of simply avoiding longer\npitches. In addition we recommend increasing the wrap coverage of the CS\nconductor from 50 % to at least 70 %. The models predict significant\nimprovement against strain sensitivity and substantial decrease of the AC\ncoupling loss in Nb3Sn CICCs, but also for NbTi CICCs minimization of the\ncoupling loss can be achieved. Although the success of long pitches to\ntransverse load degradation was already demonstrated, the prediction of the\ncombination with low coupling loss needs to be validated by a short sample\ntest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 12:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This relative gravitational potential\nenergy determines a proper time delay proportional to the laboratory non\ninertial flying time interval along the trajectory with a small factor\n5.276x10-5.
