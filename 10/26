Our results show that ${2m(r)}/ {r}$ varies with $r$.\nQuantum gravity plays an important role in the region $ r\\sim 10^3 r_0$, where\n$r_0\\sim \\beta_0 l_p $, $l_p$ is the Planck length and $\\beta_0$ is a\ndimensionless parameter accounting for quantum gravity effects. Furthermore,\nnear the center of compact stars, we find that the metric components are\n$g_{tt}\\sim r^4$ and $g_{rr}=[1-{r}^2/(6r_0^2)]^{-1}$. All these effects are\ndifferent from those obtained from classical gravity. These results can be\napplied to neutron stars or denser ones like quark stars. The observed masses\nof neutron stars ($\\leq 2M_\\odot$) indicate that $\\beta_0$ can not exceed\n$10^{37}$, not as good as the upper bound $\\beta_0<10^{34}$ from simple\nelectroweak consideration.

To reduce\nthe probability of an afterpulse, these detectors are usually equipped with a\ncircuitry that disables the trigger for a certain time after a positive\ndetection event, known as dead time. If the acquisition system connected to the\ndetector is not properly designed, efficiency issues arise when the triggering\nrate is faster than the inverse of detector's dead-time. Moreover, when this\nhappens with two or more detectors used in coincidence, a security risk called\n\"self-blinding\" can jeopardize the distribution of a secret quantum key. In\nthis paper we introduce a trigger-disabling circuitry based on an FPGA-driven\nfeedback loop, so to avoid the above-mentioned inconveniences. In the regime of\nsingle-photon-attenuated light, the electronics dynamically accept a trigger\nonly after detectors' complete recovery from dead-time.

In this paper we present a mechanism that can produce such atmospheric\ndeviations from the stellar C/O ratio. In protoplanetary disks, different\nsnowlines of oxygen- and carbon-rich ices, especially water and carbon\nmonoxide, will result in systematic variations in the C/O ratio both in the gas\nand in the condensed phase. In particular, between the H2O and CO snowlines\nmost oxygen is present in icy grains - the building blocks of planetary cores\nin the core accretion model - while most carbon remains in the gas-phase. This\nregion is coincidental with the giant-planet forming zone for a range of\nobserved protoplanetary disks. Based on standard core accretion models of\nplanet formation, gas giants that sweep up most of their atmospheres from disk\ngas outside of the water snowline will have C/O?1, while atmospheres\nsignificantly contaminated by evaporating planetesimals will have stellar or\nsub-stellar C/O when formed at the same disk radius. The overall metallicity\nwill also depend on the atmosphere formation mechanism, and exoplanetary\natmospheric compositions may therefore provide constraints on where and how a\nspecific planet formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 16:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We correct our H alpha fluxes for dust extinction by using\nmulti-wavelength data, and investigate SFR trends with mass and colour. We find\na drop in the fraction of massive galaxies with M_{*}>10^{11} Msol which are\ndetected in H alpha emission at z<0.9. We furthermore find that the fraction of\ngalaxies with H alpha emission drops steadily and significantly with redder\n(U-B) colours at z~1, and that the SSFR drops with increasing (U-B) colour for\ngalaxies at all masses. By investigating the SFR-mass relation we find that the\nSFR is roughly constant with mass, in possible contrast to previous work, and\nthat the specific star formation rate (SSFR) is lower in the most massive\ngalaxies. The scatter in the SFR vs. mass relationship is very small for those\nsystems with ongoing star formation which suggests that star formation in the\nmost massive galaxies at z~1 shuts off rather abruptly over <1 Gyr, without an\nobvious gradual decline. We furthermore investigate the SFR as a function of\n(U-B) colour divided into different mass bins, revealing a tracer of the epoch\nof transition from star forming to passive, as a form of star formation\n\"downsizing\".

The first application concerns the survival\nprobability of a point particle in a Poisson field of moving traps following\nindependent Levy motions. We show that the survival probability can only\nincrease if the point particle does not move, and the traps and the Levy\nmotions are symmetrically rearranged.

While the absolute element abundances may be\nuncertain because of unknown systematic errors and partly because of the\nsmaller amount of hot gas in young ellipticals, the relative abundance ratios\n(e.g., the alpha-element to Fe ratio, most importantly Si/Fe ratio) can be\nrelatively well constrained. We find that in two young elliptical galaxies (NGC\n720 and NGC 3923) the Si to Fe abundance ratio is super-solar (at a 99%\nsignificance level), in contrast to typical old elliptical galaxies where the\nSi to Fe abundance ratio is close to solar. Also the O/Mg ratio is close to\nsolar in the two young elliptical galaxies, as opposed to the sub-solar O/Mg\nratio reported in old elliptical galaxies. Both features appear to be less\nsignificant outside the effective radius (roughly 30\" for the galaxies under\nstudy), consistent with the observations that confine to the centermost regions\nthe signatures of recent star formation in elliptical galaxies. Observed\ndifferences between young and old elliptical galaxies can be explained by the\nadditional contribution from SNe II ejecta in the former. In young elliptical\ngalaxies, the later star formation associated with recent mergers would have a\ndual effect, resulting both in galaxy scale winds - and therefore smaller\nobserved amounts of hot ISM - because of the additional SNII heating, and in\ndifferent metal abundances, because of the additional SNII yields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 18:27:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 14:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In recent years, much effort has been put into capturing\nthe dynamics of these fluctuations by means of analytical and numerical models.\nThese attempts have been very successful for, but also remain limited to,\nisotropic polymers. To correctly interpret experimental work on (strongly)\nanisotropic semiflexible polymers, there is a need for a numerical modelling\ntool that accurately captures the dynamics of polymers with anisotropic\nmaterial properties. In the current study, we present a finite element (FE)\nframework for simulating the thermal dynamics of a single anisotropic\nsemiflexible polymer. First, we demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by\ncomparison of the simulated mean square displacement (MSD) of the end-to-end\ndistance with analytical predictions based on the worm-like chain model. Then,\nwe implement a transversely isotropic material model, characteristic for\nbiopolymers such as MTs, and study the persistence length for various ratios\nbetween the longitudinal shear modulus and corresponding Young's modulus.\nFinally, we put our findings in context by addressing a recent experimental\nwork on grafted transversely isotropic MTs. In that research, a simplified\nstatic mechanical model was used to deduce a very high level of MT anisotropy\nto explain the observation that the persistence length of grafted MTs increases\nas contour length increases.

Based on previous Keck/DEIMOS observations and\nmodels, we calculate the mass in Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe expelled from each of eight\ndSphs.

We conclude that the dSphs lost 96% to >99% of\nthe metals their stars manufactured. We apply the observed mass function of\nMilky Way dSphs to the ejected mass function to determine that a single large\ndSph, like Fornax, lost more metals over 10 Gyr than all smaller dSphs\ncombined. Therefore, small galaxies like dSphs are not significant contributors\nto the metal content of the intergalactic medium. Finally, we compare our\nejected mass function to previous X-ray measurements of the metal content of\nthe winds from the post-starburst dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1569.

In essence, a\ndigression on how could philosophy help cosmologists in what is strictly their\nfundamental endeavor is presented.

Then, a\nshort review of the standard model Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walter (FLRW)\nof cosmology is given. It seems apparent that cosmology is living a golden age\nwith the advent of observations of high precision. Nonetheless, a critical\nrevisiting of the direction in which it should go on appears also needed, for\nmisconcepts like \"quantum backgrounds for cosmological classical settings\" and\n\"quantum gravity unification\" have not been properly constructed up-to-date.\nThus, knowledge-building in cosmology, more than in any other field, should\nbegin with visions of the reality, then taking technical form whenever concepts\nand relations inbetween are translated into a mathematical structure. It is\nmandatory, therefore, that the meaning of such concepts be the same for all\ncosmologists, and that any relationship among all them be tested both logically\nas well as mathematically. In other words, the notorius feature of\nimprobability of our universe, as is well-known, assures to cosmologists a\npriviledged degree of freedom for formulating interpretations and theories.\nHowever, at the same time, it demands for their formulations and conclusions to\nbe considered in the light of data taken from astrophysical observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 19:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 18:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-14"}

We probe the spatial and\nspectral properties of both the young (~1Gyr) and old (few Gyr) stellar\npopulations. Using the H-delta equivalent widths we estimate that the burst\nmasses must have been at least 10% by mass (Mburst~10^10Mo), which is also\nconsistent with the star-formation history inferred from the broad-band SEDs.\nOn average the A-stars cover ~33% of the galaxy image, extending over\n2-15kpc^2, indicating that the characteristic E+A signature is a property of\nthe galaxy as a whole and not due to a heterogeneous mixture of populations. In\napproximately half of the sample, we find that the A-stars, nebular emission,\nand continuum emission are not co-located, suggesting that the newest stars are\nforming in a different place than those that formed ~1Gyr ago, and that recent\nstar-formation has occurred in regions distinct from the oldest stellar\npopulations. At least ten of the galaxies (91%) have dynamics that class them\nas \"fast rotators\" with magnitudes and dynamics comparable to local ellipticals\nand S0's. We also find a correlation between the spatial extent of the A-stars\nand dynamics such that the fastest rotators tend to have the most compact\nA-star populations, providing new constraints on models that aim to explain the\ntransformation of later type galaxies into early types.

We find that while\nclustering reduces the response of a single-modification network, clustering\ncan enhance the response of a double-modification network. The reduction is a\nbulk effect: a cluster presents a smaller effective target to a substrate\nmolecule in the bulk. The enhancement, on the other hand, is a local effect: a\ncluster promotes the rapid rebinding and second activation of singly active\nsubstrate molecules. As such, the enhancement relies upon frequent collisions\non a short timescale, which leads to a diffusion coefficient at which the\nenhancement is optimal. We complement simulation with analytic results at both\nthe mean-field and first-passage distribution levels.

The most\ncommon white dwarfs have carbon-oxygen dense cores. Consequently, the cooling\nages of very cool white dwarfs sensitively depend on the adopted phase diagram\nof the carbon-oxygen binary mixture. A new phase diagram of dense carbon-oxygen\nmixtures appropriate for white dwarf interiors has been recently obtained using\ndirect molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we explore the\nconsequences of this phase diagram in the evolution of cool white dwarfs. To do\nthis we employ a detailed stellar evolutionary code and accurate initial white\ndwarf configurations, derived from the full evolution of progenitor stars. We\nuse two different phase diagrams, that of Horowitz et al. (2010), which\npresents an azeotrope, and the phase diagram of Segretain & Chabrier (1993),\nwhich is of the spindle form. We computed the evolution of 0.593 and 0.878M_sun\nwhite dwarf models during the crystallization phase, and we found that the\nenergy released by carbon-oxygen phase separation is smaller when the new phase\ndiagram of Horowitz et al. (2010) is used. This translates into time delays\nthat are on average a factor about 2 smaller than those obtained when the phase\ndiagram of Segretain & Chabrier (1993) is employed. Our results have important\nimplications for white dwarf cosmochronology, because the cooling ages of very\nold white dwarfs are different for the two phase diagrams.

Such discs must be truncated at a finite radius, and they\nmust be stabilized and rendered self-similar by a suitable halo. The halo and\nthe rotating disc share the self-similar class and must form together to arrive\nat the suggested state. We make comparisons with the well-known rigidly\nrotating, Kalnajs discs; one of which is axi-symmetric and finite while the\nother is infinite and decomposed into spiral modes. We find the\nself-consistent, self-similar, distribution functions in one and two dimensions\nin a rigidly rotating, collisionless system. In the case of two dimensions we\ndeduce the self-consistency condition for discrete spiral arms.\n  We give an estimate of the disturbance created in the halo by the presence of\nthe disc, and argue that the halo itself should be close to self-similarity. A\nvery weak cusp in the halo may be necessary. The necessary spatial coincidence\nof the halo results in a kind of disc-halo `conspiracy'. Finally the disc\nequations are formulated in `spiral' coordinates, and the passage to an\napproximately discrete `line spiral' is given as an example. Although in two\ndimensions the collisionless particles enter and leave the arms in non-linear\nepicycles, they move approximately parallel to the arms in the line spiral\nlimit. The spiral pattern is however in rigid rotation. Aperiodic spiral arms\nare suggested wherein discontinuities may be coarse-grained to appear as\ncollisionless shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 21:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-27"}

The properties of Ly-alpha emitters at 0<z<7\nare predicted using two outflow geometries: a Shell of neutral gas and a Wind\nejecting material, both expanding at constant velocity. We characterise the\ndifferences in the Ly-alpha line profiles predicted by the two outflow\ngeometries in terms of their width, asymmetry and shift from the line centre\nfor a set of outflows with different hydrogen column densities, expansion\nvelocities and metallicities. In general, the Ly-alpha line profile of the\nShell geometry is broader and more asymmetric, and the Ly-alpha escape fraction\nis lower than with the Wind geometry for the same set of parameters. In order\nto implement the outflow geometries in the semi-analytical model GALFORM, a\nnumber of free parameters in the outflow model are set by matching the\nluminosity function of Ly-alpha emitters over the whole observed redshift\nrange. The models are consistent with the observationally inferred Ly-alpha\nescape fractions, equivalent width distributions and with the shape of the\nLy-alpha line from composite spectra. Interestingly, our predicted UV\nluminosity function of Ly-alpha emitters and the fraction of Ly-alpha emitters\nin Lyman-break galaxy samples at high redshift are in partial agreement with\nobservations. Attenuation of the Ly-alpha line by the presence of a neutral\nintergalactic medium at high redshift could be responsible for this\ndisagreement. We predict that Ly-alpha emitters constitute a subset of the\ngalaxy population with lower metallicities, lower instantaneous star formation\nrates and larger sizes than the overall population at the same UV luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 04:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In principle, graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate\nprovides potential system to overcome these challenges. Recent theoretical and\nexperimental studies have provided conflicting results: while theoretical\nstudies suggested a possibility of a finite bandgap of graphene on hBN, recent\nexperimental studies find no bandgap. Using the first-principles density\nfunctional method and the many-body perturbation theory, we have studied\ngraphene on hBN substrate. A Bernal stacked graphene on hBN has a bandgap on\nthe order of 0.1 eV, which disappears when graphene is misaligned with respect\nto hBN. The latter is the likely scenario in realistic devices. In contrast, if\ngraphene supported on hBN is hydrogenated, the resulting system (graphone)\nexhibits bandgaps larger than 2.5 eV. While the bandgap opening in graphene/hBN\nis due to symmetry breaking and is vulnerable to slight perturbation such as\nmisalignment, the graphone bandgap is due to chemical functionalization and is\nrobust in the presence of misalignment. The bandgap of graphone reduces by\nabout 1 eV when it is supported on hBN due to the polarization effects at the\ngraphone/hBN interface. The band offsets at graphone/hBN interface indicate\nthat hBN can be used not only as a substrate but also as a dielectric in the\nfield effect devices employing graphone as a channel material. Our study could\nopen up new way of bandgap engineering in graphene based nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 04:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-27"}

Another possibility is that some of the VLBI\ncores had Faraday rotations of several tens of thousand of rad/m^2, which were\nnot properly fit using the three-frequency data due to n\\pi ambiguities in the\nobserved polarization angles, leading to incorrect subtraction of the effects\nof the core Faraday rotation, and so incorrect intrinsic radio polarization\nangles \\chi_0. We obtained additional 12+15+22+24+43GHz plus optical\nobservations for 8 of 40 AGNs previously considered. Our results indicate that,\nalthough some VLBI radio cores have comparatively high rotation measures, this\nalone cannot explain the misalignments found between the radio core and optical\nVLBI polarization angles, \\Delta\\chi = |\\chi_opt - \\chi_0|. Comparison between\n\\Delta\\chi and (i) the orientation of \\chi_0 relative to the jet direction,\n(ii) the degree of polarization of the core, (iii) a depolarization factor,\n(iv) the core rotation measures and (v) the core magnetic fields 1pc from the\njet base do not yield evidence for any correlations between these properties.\nThere is some evidence that the maximum observed \\Delta\\chi tends to decrease\nas the core-region magnetic field increases, suggesting that misalignments in\n\\Delta\\chi could be associated in part with relatively low core magnetic\nfields. Thus, although the overall distribution of \\Delta\\chi for all 40\nsources in our sample does show a significant peak at \\Delta\\chi\\sim0, it\nremains unclear what distinguishes these AGN cores from those showing\nappreciable misalignment between optical and VLBI-core polarization position\nangles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 07:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In the\nperspective provided by our self-similar solutions we link the halo structure\nto its two-stage growth history, and propose the following picture. During the\nearly fast collapse of the inner region dominated by a few merging clumps,\nefficient dynamical relaxation plays a key role in producing a closely\nuniversal mass density and pseudo phase-space density profiles; in particular,\nthese are found to depend only weakly on the detailed shape of the initial\nperturbation and the related collapse times.

Our consideration is based on\nthe tensile (Pincus) blob picture of a pulled chain and the notion of\npropagating front of tensile force along the chain backbone, suggested recently\nby T. Sakaue. The driving force is associated with a chemical potential\ngradient that acts on each chain segment inside the pore. Depending on its\nstrength, different regimes of polymer motion (named after the typical chain\nconformation, \"trumpet\", \"stem-trumpet\", etc.) occur. Assuming that the local\ndriving and drag forces are equal (i.e., in a quasi-static approximation), we\nderive an equation of motion for the tensile front position $X(t)$. We show\nthat the scaling law for the average translocation time $<\\tau>$ changes from\n$<\\tau> \\sim N^{2\\nu}/f^{1/\\nu}$ to $<\\tau> \\sim N^{1+\\nu}/f$ (for the\nfree-draining case) as the dimensionless force ${\\widetilde f}_{R} = a N^{\\nu}f\n/T$ (where $a$, $N$, $\\nu$, $f$, $T$ are the Kuhn segment length, the chain\nlength, the Flory exponent, the driving force, and the temperature,\nrespectively) increases. These and other predictions are tested by Molecular\nDynamics (MD) simulation. Data from our computer experiment indicates indeed\nthat the translocation scaling exponent $\\alpha$ grows with the pulling force\n${\\widetilde f}_{R}$) albeit the observed exponent $\\alpha$ stays\nsystematically smaller than the theoretically predicted value.

We propose\nan acceleration technique for GEMM based on dynamically adjusting the\nimprecision (distortion) of computation. Our technique employs adaptive scalar\ncompanding and rounding to input matrix blocks followed by two forms of packing\nin floating-point that allow for concurrent calculation of multiple results.\nSince the adaptive companding process controls the increase of concurrency (via\npacking), the increase in processing throughput (and the corresponding increase\nin distortion) depends on the input data statistics. To demonstrate this, we\nderive the optimal throughput-distortion control framework for GEMM for the\nbroad class of zero-mean, independent identically distributed, input sources.\nOur approach converts matrix multiplication in programmable processors into a\ncomputation channel: when increasing the processing throughput, the output\nnoise (error) increases due to (i) coarser quantization and (ii) computational\nerrors caused by exceeding the machine-precision limitations. We show that,\nunder certain distortion in the GEMM computation, the proposed framework can\nsignificantly surpass 100% of the peak performance of a given processor. The\npractical benefits of our proposal are shown in a face recognition system and a\nmulti-layer perceptron system trained for metadata learning from a large music\nfeature database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 11:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Our analysis shows\nthat traditional GARCH and Gaussian stochastic-volatility models are unable to\nexplain two key stylized features of global markets during presumptive\ncontagion periods: shocks to aggregate market volatility can be sudden and\nexplosive, and they are associated with specific directional biases in the\ncross-section of country-level returns. Our model repairs this deficit by\nassuming that the random shocks to volatility are heavy-tailed and correlated\ncross-sectionally, both with each other and with returns. The fundamental\nconclusion of our analysis is that great care is needed in modeling volatility\nif one wishes to characterize the relationship between volatility and contagion\nthat is predicted by economic theory.\n  In analyzing daily data, we find evidence for significant contagion effects\nduring the major EU crisis periods of May 2010 and August 2011, where contagion\nis defined as excess correlation in the residuals from a factor model\nincorporating global and regional market risk factors. Some of this excess\ncorrelation can be explained by quantifying the impact of shocks to aggregate\nvolatility in the cross-section of expected returns - but only, it turns out,\nif one is extremely careful in accounting for the explosive nature of these\nshocks. We show that global markets have time-varying cross-sectional\nsensitivities to these shocks, and that high sensitivities strongly predict\nperiods of financial crisis. Moreover, the pattern of temporal changes in\ncorrelation structure between volatility and returns is readily interpretable\nin terms of the major events of the periods in question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 13:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 20:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-28"}

Time observables are interesting quantities in quantum\ntheory because they often cannot be associated with self-adjoint operators.\nTheir definition therefore touches on foundational issues in quantum theory.\n  Various operational approaches to defining time observables have been\nproposed in the past. Two of the most common are those based on pulsed\nmeasurements in the form of strings of projection operators and continuous\nmeasurements in the form of complex potentials. One of the major achievements\nof this thesis is to prove that these two operational approaches are\nequivalent.\n  However operational approaches are somewhat unsatisfying by themselves. To\nprovide a definition of time observables which is not linked to a particular\nmeasurement scheme we employ the decoherent, or consistent, histories approach\nto quantum theory. We focus on the arrival time, one particular example of a\ntime observable, and we use the relationship between pulsed and continuous\nmeasurements to relate the decoherent histories approach to one based on\ncomplex potentials. This lets us compute the arrival time probability\ndistribution in decoherent histories and we show that it agrees with\nsemiclassical expectations in the right limit. We do this both for a free\nparticle and for a particle coupled to an environment.\n  Finally, we consider how the results discussed in this thesis relate to those\nderived by coupling a particle to a model clock. We show that for a general\nclass of clock models the probabilities thus measured can be simply related to\nthe ideal ones computed via decoherent histories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 13:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-27"}

It can also be presented in the\nterms of finite lattices, and the tools of economic description of a finite\nlattice have long existed in lattice theory. We present this approach by\ndescribing the so-called D-basis and introducing the concept of ordered direct\nbasis of an implicational system. A direct basis of a closure operator, or an\nimplicational system, is a set of implications that allows one to compute the\nclosure of an arbitrary set by a single iteration. This property is preserved\nby the D-basis at the cost of following a prescribed order in which\nimplications will be attended. In particular, using an ordered direct basis\nallows to optimize the forward chaining procedure in logic programming that\nuses the Horn fragment of propositional logic. One can extract the D-basis from\nany direct unit basis S in time polynomial in the size of S, and it takes only\nlinear time of the cardinality of the D-basis to put it into a proper order. We\nproduce examples of closure systems on a 6-element set, for which the canonical\nbasis of Duquenne and Guigues is not ordered direct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 14:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 02:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 May 2012 16:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

A thorough comparison of\ndifferent algorithms (a total of fourteen) is provided. In addition to\ncommunity level evaluation, we propose a framework for evaluating algorithms'\nability to detect overlapping nodes, which helps to assess over-detection and\nunder-detection. After considering community level detection performance\nmeasured by Normalized Mutual Information, the Omega index, and node level\ndetection performance measured by F-score, we reached the following\nconclusions. For low overlapping density networks, SLPA, OSLOM, Game and COPRA\noffer better performance than the other tested algorithms. For networks with\nhigh overlapping density and high overlapping diversity, both SLPA and Game\nprovide relatively stable performance. However, test results also suggest that\nthe detection in such networks is still not yet fully resolved. A common\nfeature observed by various algorithms in real-world networks is the relatively\nsmall fraction of overlapping nodes (typically less than 30%), each of which\nbelongs to only 2 or 3 communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 15:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 03:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 21:27:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 19:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-30"}
