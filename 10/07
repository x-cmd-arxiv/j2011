From the universal temperature dependence of the\nmolar excess entropy for the deeply supercooled liquids, we derive the\ntemperature dependence of the mole fraction of the liquid-like regions to\nobtain the universal temperature dependence of the relaxation time or the\nviscosity for the deeply supercooled liquids.

Here we present an analysis of the long-term pulsed\nX-ray properties of the young, energetic pulsar PSR B1509-58 using data from\nthe Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We measured the 2-50 keV pulsed flux for 14.7\nyr of X-ray observations and found that it is consistent with being constant on\nall relevant time scales, and place a 3 sigma upper limit on day-to-week\nvariability of <28%.

This supports the hypothesis that\nX-ray properties of rotation-powered X-ray pulsars can be stable on decade-long\ntime scales.

There is a significant gap between known upper and lower bounds for\nDkS: the current best algorithm gives an ~ O(n^{1/4}) approximation, while even\nshowing a small constant factor hardness requires significantly stronger\nassumptions than P != NP. In addition to interest in designing better\nalgorithms, a number of recent results have exploited the conjectured hardness\nof densest k-subgraph and its variants. Thus, understanding the approximability\nof DkS is an important challenge.\n  In this work, we give evidence for the hardness of approximating DkS within\npolynomial factors.

Orbital motion provides insight into the stability, and\npossible formation mechanisms of this planetary system. Dynamical studies can\nalso provide constraints on the planets' masses, which help calibrate\nevolutionary models. Yet, measuring the orbital motion is a very difficult task\nbecause the long-period orbits (50-500 yr) require long time baselines and\nhigh-precision astrometry. This paper studies the three planets HR 8799b, c and\nd in the archival data set of HR 8799 obtained with the HST NICMOS coronagraph\nin 1998. The detection of all three planets is made possible by a careful\noptimization of the LOCI algorithm.

These HST\nimages provide a ten-year baseline with the discovery images from 2008, and\ntherefore offer a unique opportunity to constrain their orbital motion now.\nRecent dynamical studies of this system show the existence of a few possible\nstable solutions involving mean motion resonances, where the interaction\nbetween c and d plays a major role.

The YSO population was identified and classified in the\nIRAC/MIPS color-magnitude space according to the `Class' scheme and compared to\nother classifications based on intrinsic properties. Class 0/I and II\ncandidates were also compared to low/intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars\nselected through their colors and magnitudes in 2MASS. We find that a reliable\ncolor/magnitude selection of low-mass PMS stars in the infrared requires prior\nknowledge of the protostar population, while intermediate mass objects can be\nmore reliably identified. By means of the MST algorithm and our YSO spatial\ndistribution and age maps we investigated the YSO groups and the star formation\nhistory in W3. We find signatures of clustered and distributed star formation\nin both triggered and quiescent environments. The central/western parts of the\nGMC are dominated by large scale turbulence likely powered by isolated bursts\nof star formation that triggered secondary star formation events. Star\nformation in the eastern high density layer also shows signs of extended\nperiods of star formation. While our findings support triggering as a key\nfactor for inducing and enhancing some of the major star forming activity in\nthe HDL (e.g., W3 Main/W3(OH)), we argue that some degree of quiescent or\nspontaneous star formation is required to explain the observed YSO population.\nOur results also support previous studies claiming an spontaneous origin for\nthe isolated massive star(s) powering KR 140.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 23:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-29"}

It is challenging to identify\nchemical components from a wide range of explosives. There are two key steps\ninvolved. One is a nondestructive and informative spectroscopic technique for\ndata acquisition. The other is an associated library of reference features\nalong with a computational method for feature matching and meaningful detection\nwithin or beyond the library.\n  Recently several experimental techniques based on Raman scattering have been\ndeveloped to perform standoff detection and identification of explosives, and\nthey prove to be successful under certain idealized conditions. However data\nanalysis is limited to standard least squares method assuming the complete\nknowledge of the chemical components. In this paper, we develop a new iterative\nmethod to identify unknown substances from mixture samples of Raman\nspectroscopy. In the first step, a constrained least squares method decomposes\nthe data into a sum of linear combination of the known components and a\nnon-negative residual. In the second step, a sparse and convex blind source\nseparation method extracts components geometrically from the residuals.\nVerification based on the library templates or expert knowledge helps to\nconfirm these components. If necessary, the confirmed meaningful components are\nfed back into step one to refine the residual and then step two extracts\npossibly more hidden components. The two steps may be iterated until no more\ncomponents can be identified.\n  We illustrate the proposed method in processing a set of the so called swept\nwavelength optical resonant Raman spectroscopy experimental data by a\nsatisfactory blind extraction of a priori unknown chemical explosives from\nmixture samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2011 05:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-10"}

It builds upon the fact that, in the presence of far UV\nradiation and hydrocarbon grains, the hydrogen gas will be partially\ndissociated and the grain surface will be partially hydrogenated and partially\ncovered with free carbon bonds. Under such a statistical equilibrium, H atoms\nfrom the gas will recombine with C atoms at the grain surface at some rate. At\neach recombination, the H atom deposits an energy of about 5 eV in the grain.\nHalf of this is directly converted into vibrational excitation, always\ndistributed in the same way among the most tightly coupled vibration modes of\nthe grain. Absent frequent grain-grain collisions, the only outlet for this\nenergy is IR reemission, part of it in the UIBs, provided the chemical\nstructure of the grains is adequate, and the other part in the continuum. The\npartition only depends upon the grain size, all grains being assumed to have\nthe same constitution. Only a fraction, about 0.25, of the grains (among the\nsmallest ones) will contribute significantly to the UIBs.\n  It is shown quantitatively that H impacts are generally more efficient\nexcitation agents than UV absorption because of the overwhelming abundance of\nhydrogen relative to UV photons. Only very close to young bright stars is this\nno longer true because photon flux then largely exceeds H atom flux. Thus H\nimpacts and FUV absorption are both necessary to understand the variety of\nobserved UIB spectra.\n  The model translates into a small number of equations enabling a quantitative\ncomparison of its predictions with available astronomical observations, which\nhave become exquisitely rich and accurate in the last two decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2011 08:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The Wasserstein distance is used to\ncompare two histograms. The Wasserstein distance between histograms is\nconstituted by two components: the first based on the means, and the second, to\ninternal dispersions (standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and so on) of the\nhistograms.

These constructions are made in a purely local way, with a\nsubstantial use of type theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2011 09:45:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 18:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

Such a space \\Omega\\ is composed of all maps that are conformal\non domains containing a fix compact annular set of the Riemann sphere, and that\nare \"sense-preserving\". The calculus of variations is based on describing\ninfinitesimal variations of such maps using vector fields. We show that\nderivatives of all orders with respect to such conformal maps, upon conjugation\nby an appropriate functional, give rise to the structure of the Virasoro vertex\noperator algebra. Our construction proceeds in three steps. We first put a\nnatural topology on \\Omega\\ and define smooth paths and an operation of\ndifferentiation to all orders (\"conformal derivatives\"). We then study certain\nsecond-order variational equations and their solutions. We finally show that\nsuch solutions give rise to representations of the Virasoro algebra in terms of\nconformal derivatives, from which follows constructions for the Virasoro vertex\noperator algebra.

The\napproach presented in this work is able to deal with course estimation for\nextrinsic system inputs or intrinsic reactants, both not being constrained by\nthe reaction network itself. Our method is based on variational calculus which\nis carried out analytically to derive an augmented system of differential\nequations including the unconstrained components as ordinary state variables.\nFinally, conventional parameter estimation is applied to the augmented system\nresulting in a combined estimation of courses and parameters. The combined\nestimation approach takes the uncertainty in input courses correctly into\naccount. This leads to precise parameter estimates and correct confidence\nintervals.

It is pointed\nout that under this framework, a certain structure is anticipated in the cross\nsection expression for a `double perturbative splitting' diagram, which in the\nframework is regarded as DPS.

These requirements set a stringent constraint on the accuracy of the\nestimation of the location of the stellar image on the CCD for each\nobservation: e.g., 0.3 milli-arseconds (mas) or 0.005 pixels for the same V=15\nG2V star. However the Gaia CCDs will suffer from charge transfer inefficiency\n(CTI) caused by radiation damage that will degrade the stellar image quality\nand may degrade the astrometric performance of Gaia if not properly addressed.\nFor the first time at this level of detail, the potential impact of radiation\ndamage on the performance of Gaia is investigated. In this first paper we focus\non the evaluation of the CTI impact on the image location accuracy. We show\nthat CTI decreases the stellar image signal-to-noise ratio and irreversibly\ndegrades the image location estimation precision. As a consequence the location\nestimation standard errors increase by up to 6% for a radiation damage level\nequivalent to the end-of-mission. In addition the CTI-induced image distortion\nintroduces a systematic bias in the image location estimation (up to 0.05\npixels or 3 mas in the Gaia operating conditions). We present a novel approach\nto CTI mitigation that enables, without correction of the raw data, the\nunbiased estimation of the image location and flux from damaged observations.\nIts implementation reduces the maximum measured location bias for the faintest\nmagnitude to 0.005 pixels (~4e-4 pixels at magnitude 15). In a second paper we\nwill investigate how the CTI effects affect the final astrometric accuracy of\nGaia by propagating residual errors through the astrometric solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2011 14:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We comment on the prospect of discovery or exclusion for a\nrange of masses and couplings at both 7 and 14 TeV and show that the reach\nextends significantly with increasing centre-of-mass energy. Results are\ncompared with the effect of a hypothetical spin-1/2 excited top as well as\nother BSM scenarios which predict the presence of higher dimension effective\noperators. We also calculate distributions for several observables which can be\nused to distinguish between the different scenarios in the presence of a\ndeviation from the SM prediction for the ttbar cross section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2011 15:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Following Gibbs-Tolman concept, we introduce the\nequimolar radius R_e of sharp surface droplet at which the surface tension is\napplied and the radius of tension surface R_s which provides the minimum of the\nsurface tension coefficient \\sigma. This procedure allows us to derive both the\nsurface tension and the corresponding curvature correction (Tolman length)\ncorrectly for the curved and diffuse interface. We point out that the curvature\ncorrection depends significantly on the finite diffuse interface. This fact is\nmissed in traditional nuclear considerations of curvature correction to the\nsurface tension. We show that Tolman's length \\xi is negative for nuclear\nFermi-liquid drop. The value of the Tolman length is only slightly sensitive to\nthe Skyrme force parametrization and equals \\xi=-0.36 fm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2011 15:19:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 13:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The characteristic rate of the decay increases linearly\nwith the strength of repulsion in the weak-coupling regime, while it is\ninversely proportional to it in the strong-coupling regime.

This is a result of the infinite time of evolution that enhances\nthe small effects of dissipation to form singularities.
