In fact, in the very early universe\nthese relic gravitons could have acted as slow gravity waves. They may have\nthen acted to focus the geodesics of radiation and matter. Therefore, their\nimprint on the later evolution of the universe could appear as filaments and\ndomain wall in the Universe today. In that case, the effect on Cosmic Microwave\nBackground should be analogous to the effect of water waves, which, in focusing\nlight, create optical caustics which are commonly seen on the bottom of\nswimming pools. We analyze this important issue by showing how relic massive\nGWs perturb the trajectories of Cosmic Microwave Background photons\n(gravitational lensing by relic GWs). The consequence of the type of physics\ndiscussed is outlined by illustrating an amplification of what might be called\noptical chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2011 18:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 06:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 09:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The observed X-ray flux (and polarization state)\nis fundamentally a convolution of the cross-section for the hard X-ray emission\nprocess(es) in question with the electron distribution function, which is in\nturn a function of energy, direction, spatial location and time. To address the\nproblems of particle propagation and acceleration one needs to infer as much\ninformation as possible on this electron distribution function, through a\ndeconvolution of this fundamental relationship. This review presents recent\nprogress toward this goal using spectroscopic, imaging and polarization\nmeasurements, primarily from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic\nImager (RHESSI). Previous conclusions regarding the energy, angular (pitch\nangle) and spatial distributions of energetic electrons in solar flares are\ncritically reviewed.

This unprecedented quality of data allows for the first\ntime inference of the angular distributions of the X-ray-emitting electrons\nusing albedo, improved model-independent inference of electron energy spectra\nand emission measures of thermal plasma. Moreover, imaging spectroscopy has\nrevealed hitherto unknown details of solar flare morphology and detailed\nspectroscopy of coronal, footpoint and extended sources in flaring regions.\nAdditional attempts to measure hard X-ray polarization were not sufficient to\nput constraints on the degree of anisotropy of electrons, but point to the\nimportance of obtaining good quality polarization data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2011 18:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 10:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-12"}

In contrast, a dominant line\nof work in the theory of voting over the past 15 years has considered a\ndifferent kind of scenario, also fundamental to voting, in which there is a\ngenuinely \"best\" outcome that voters would agree on if they only had enough\ninformation. This type of scenario has its roots in the classical Condorcet\nJury Theorem; it includes cases such as jurors in a criminal trial who all want\nto reach the correct verdict but disagree in their inferences from the\navailable evidence, or a corporate board of directors who all want to improve\nthe company's revenue, but who have different information that favors different\noptions.\n  This style of voting leads to a natural set of questions: each voter has a\n{\\em private signal} that provides probabilistic information about which option\nis best, and a central question is whether a simple plurality voting system,\nwhich tabulates votes for different options, can cause the group decision to\narrive at the correct option. We show that plurality voting is powerful enough\nto achieve this: there is a way for voters to map their signals into votes for\noptions in such a way that --- with sufficiently many voters --- the correct\noption receives the greatest number of votes with high probability. We show\nfurther, however, that any process for achieving this is inherently expensive\nin the number of voters it requires: succeeding in identifying the correct\noption with probability at least $1 - \\eta$ requires $\\Omega(n^3 \\epsilon^{-2}\n\\log \\eta^{-1})$ voters, where $n$ is the number of options and $\\epsilon$ is a\ndistributional measure of the minimum difference between the options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 03:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-19"}

Here we go one step further by an exhaustive\ninvestigation of the influence of the shearing geometry through the gap width\n$e$ and the boundary conditions. While slip conditions at the walls seem to\nhave a negligible influence on the fluidization time $\\tau_f$, different\nfluidization processes are observed depending on $\\gp$ and $e$: the shear band\nremains almost stationary for several hours at low shear rates or small gap\nwidths before strong fluctuations lead to a homogeneous flow, whereas at larger\nvalues of $\\gp$ or $e$, the transient shear band is seen to invade the whole\ngap in a much smoother way. Still, the power-law behaviour appears as very\nrobust and hints to critical-like dynamics. To further discuss these results,\nwe propose (i) a qualitative scenario to explain the induction-like period that\nprecedes full fluidization and (ii) an analogy with critical phenomena that\nnaturally leads to the observed power laws if one assumes that the yield point\nis the critical point of an underlying out-of-equilibrium phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 03:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 13:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-24"}

Second, we show that in the limit where the line\nsegments are much longer than the typical pore size, $p(r_{no})$ becomes a\nRayleigh distribution.

RHESSI's precise\nmeasurements of hard X-ray continuum spectra enable model-independent\ndeconvolution to obtain the parent electron spectrum. Taking into account the\neffects of albedo, these show that the low energy cut-off to the electron\npower-law spectrum is typically below tens of keV, confirming that the\naccelerated electrons contain a large fraction of the energy released in\nflares. RHESSI has detected a high coronal hard X-ray source that is filled\nwith accelerated electrons whose energy density is comparable to the\nmagnetic-field energy density. This suggests an efficient conversion of energy,\npreviously stored in the magnetic field, into the bulk acceleration of\nelectrons. A new, collisionless (Hall) magnetic reconnection process has been\nidentified through theory and simulations, and directly observed in space and\nin the laboratory; it should occur in the solar corona as well, with a\nreconnection rate fast enough for the energy release in flares. The\nreconnection process could result in the formation of multiple elongated\nmagnetic islands, that then collapse to bulk-accelerate the electrons, rapidly\nenough to produce the observed hard X-ray emissions. RHESSI's pioneering\n{\\gamma}-ray line imaging of energetic ions, revealing footpoints straddling a\nflare loop arcade, has provided strong evidence that ion acceleration is also\nrelated to magnetic reconnection. Flare particle acceleration is shown to have\na close relationship to impulsive Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events\nobserved in the interplanetary medium, and also to both fast coronal mass\nejections and gradual SEP events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 07:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}

The basin-scale properties of the hydrological\ncycle are computed by spatially integrating the precipitation, evaporation, and\nrunoff fields using the Voronoi-Thiessen tessellation formalism. The span of\nthe model simulated mean annual water balances is of the same order of\nmagnitude of the observed Danube discharge of the Delta; the true value is\nwithin the range simulated by the models. Some land components seem to have\ndeficiencies since there are cases of violation of water conservation when\nannual means are considered. The overall performance and the degree of\nagreement of the GCMs are comparable to those of the RCMs analyzed in a\nprevious work, in spite of the much higher resolution and common nesting of the\nRCMs. The reanalyses are shown to feature several inconsistencies and cannot be\nused as a verification benchmark for the hydrological cycle in the Danubian\nregion. In the scenario runs, for basically all models the water balance\ndecreases, whereas its interannual variability increases. Changes in the\nstrength of the hydrological cycle are not consistent among models: it is\nconfirmed that capturing the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle\nis not an easy task over land areas. Moreover, in several cases we find that\nqualitatively different behaviours emerge among the models: the ensemble mean\ndoes not represent any sort of average model, and often it falls between the\nmodels' clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 13:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}

In the instrumental records,\nthe steepest 100-year temperature fall happened in the 19th century and the\nsteepest rise in the 20th century, both events being of about the same\nmagnitude. Evaluation by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) yields Hurst\nexponents that are in good agreement with the literature. DFA, Monte Carlo\nsimulations, and synthetic records reveal that both 100-year events were caused\nby external trends. In contrast to this, the reconstructed records show\nstronger 100-year rises and falls as quite common during the last 2000 years.\nThese results contradict the hypothesis of an unusual (anthropogenic) global\nwarming during the 20th century. As a hypothesis, the sun's magnetic field,\nwhich is correlated with sunspot numbers, is put forward as an explanation. The\nlong-term low-frequency fluctuations in sunspot numbers are not detectable by\nthe DFA in the monthly instrumental records, resulting in the common low Hurst\nexponents. The same does not hold true for the 2000-year-long reconstructed\nrecords, which explains both their higher Hurst exponents and the higher\nprobabilities of strong 100-year temperature fluctuations. A long-term\nsynthetic record that embodies the reconstructed sunspot number fluctuations\nincludes the different Hurst exponents of both the instrumental and the\nreconstructed records and, therefore, corroborates the conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 14:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}
