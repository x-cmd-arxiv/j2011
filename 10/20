Recently there has been focus on\nthe importance of the current-induced non-conservative forces (NC) and\nBerry-phase derived forces (BP) regarding the stability of molecular-scale\ncontacts. Systems based on molecules bridging electrically gated graphene\nelectrodes may offer an interesting test-bed for these effects.\n  We employ a semi-classical Langevin approach in combination with DFT\ncalculations to study the current-induced vibrational dynamics of an atomic\ncarbon chain connecting electrically gated graphene electrodes. This\nillustrates how the device stability can be predicted solely from the modes\nobtained from the Langevin equation including the current induced forces. We\npoint out that the gate offers control of the current independent of bias\nvoltage which can be used to explore current-induced vibrational instabilities\ndue the NC/BP forces.

In this paper, we develop a ray-tracing\nalgorithm to calculate the apparent surface areas of moderately spinning\nneutron stars making use of the Hartle-Thorne metric. This analytic metric\nallows us to calculate various observables of the neutron star in a way that\ndepends only on its macroscopic properties and not on the details of its\nequation of state. We use this algorithm to calculate the changes in the\napparent surface area, which could play a role in measurements of neutron star\nradii and, therefore, in constraining their equation of state. We show that\nwhether the spinning neutron star appears larger or smaller than its\nnon-rotating counterpart depends primarily on its equatorial radius. For\nneutron stars with radii ~10 km, the corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime\ncause the apparent surface area to increase with spin frequency. In contrast,\nfor neutron stars with radii ~15 km, the oblateness of the star dominates the\nspacetime corrections and causes the apparent surface area to decrease with\nincreasing spin frequency. In all cases, the change in the apparent geometric\nsurface area for the range of observed spin frequencies is < 5% and hence only\na small source of error in the measurement of neutron star radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 20:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 02:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We study IZw18 and IZw18C down to an unprecedently faint surface\nbrightness level using HST ACS data.\n  We argue that the properties of IZw18C can be consistently accounted for by\npropagating star formation over the past ~100 Myr, in combination with stellar\ndiffusion and the associated radial stellar mass filtering effect (P02).\n  As for IZw18, we find that ne extends out to ~16 stellar scale lengths and\nprovides at least 1/3 of the total optical emission.\n  The case of IZw18 suggests caution in studies of distant galaxies in dominant\nstages of their evolution, rapidly assembling their stellar mass at high\nspecific star formation rates (SSFRs). It calls attention to the fact that ne\nis not necessarily cospatial with the underlying ionizing and non-ionizing\nstellar background, neither has to scale with its surface density. The\nprodigious energetic output during dominant phases of galaxy evolution may\nresult in large exponential ne envelopes, extending much beyond the still\ncompact stellar component, just like in IZw18. Therefore, the morphological\nparadigm of IZw18, while probably unique in the nearby Universe, may be\nubiquitous among high-SSFR galaxies at high redshift. Using IZw18 as reference,\nwe show that extended ne may introduce substantial observational biases and\nsignificantly affect fundamental galaxy relations. Among others, we show that\nthe surface brightness profiles of distant morphological analogs to IZw18 may\nbe barely distinguishable from Sersic profiles with an exponent 2<n<5, thus\nmimicking the profiles of massive galaxy spheroids.

We\nresolve the dependence on eps in the number of measurements required of a\nk-sparse recovery algorithm, up to polylogarithmic factors for the central\ncases of p = 1 and p = 2.

The flares appear to show a departure\nfrom the well known power-law frequency-size distribution. Specifically, too\nfew GOES C-class and no M-class flares were observed by comparison with a\npower-law distribution (Wheatland in Astrophys. J. 710, 1324, 2010). This was\nconjectured to be due to the region having insufficient magnetic energy to\npower large events. We construct nonlinear force-free extrapolations of the\ncoronal magnetic field of active region AR 11029 using data taken on 24 October\nby the SOLIS Vector-SpectroMagnetograph (SOLIS/VSM), and data taken on 27\nOctober by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope SpectroPolarimeter (Hinode/SP).\nForce-free modeling with photospheric magnetogram data encounters problems\nbecause the magnetogram data are inconsistent with a force-free model, and we\nemploy a recently developed `self-consistency' procedure which addresses this\nand accommodates uncertainties in the boundary data (Wheatland and Regnier in\nAstrophys.

An order of magnitude scaling\nbetween RHESSI non-thermal energy and GOES peak X-ray flux is established from\na sample of flares from the literature and is used to estimate flare energies\nfrom observed GOES peak X-ray flux. Based on the scaling, we conclude that the\nestimated free energy of AR 11029 on 27 October when the flaring rate peaked is\nsufficient to power M-class or X-class flares, and hence the modeling does not\nappear to support the hypothesis that the absence of large flares is due to the\nregion having limited energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 01:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-28"}

In particular BCFW shifts for particles\nwhich are not color adjacent and some particular generalizations of this\nsituation are analyzed in some detail in four and higher dimensions. For\ngeneric non-adjacent shifts our results are independent of loop order for\nintegrands and hold for generic minimally coupled gauge theories with possible\nscalar potential and Yukawa terms.

The characterization of these devices has been\nperformed with the ATLAS pixel read-out systems, TurboDAQ and USBPIX, before\nand after irradiation with 25 MeV protons and neutrons up to a fluence of\n5x10**15 neq /cm2. The charge collection measurements carried out with\nradioactive sources have proven the feasibility of employing this kind of\ndetectors up to these particle fluences. The collected charge has been measured\nto be for any fluence in excess of twice the value of the FE-I3 threshold,\ntuned to 3200 e. The first results from beam test data with 120 GeV pions at\nthe CERN-SPS are also presented, demonstrating a high tracking efficiency\nbefore irradiation and a high collected charge for a device irradiated at\n10**15 neq /cm2. This work has been performed within the framework of the RD50\nCollaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 08:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 09:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-01"}

We collect optical and UV spectra of the target stars which are\nanalyzed by means of atmosphere models computed with the code CMFGEN. The\nspectra of binary stars are disentangled and the components are studied\nseparately. All stars have an evolutionary age less than 5 million years, with\nthe most massive stars being among the youngest. Nitrogen surface abundances\nshow no clear relation with projected rotational velocities. Binaries and\nsingle stars show the same range of enrichment. This is attributed to the youth\nand/or wide separation of the binary systems in which the components have not\n(yet) experienced strong interaction. A clear trend of larger enrichment in\nhigher luminosity objects is observed, consistent with what evolutionary models\nwith rotation predict for a population of O stars at a given age. We confirm\nthe weakness of winds in late O dwarfs. In general, mass loss rates derived\nfrom UV lines are lower than mass loss rates obtained from Ha. The UV mass loss\nrates are even lower than the single line driving limit in the latest type\ndwarfs. These issues are discussed in the context of the structure of massive\nstars winds. The evolutionary and spectroscopic masses are in agreement above\n25 Msun but the uncertainties are large. Below this threshold, the few\nlate-type O stars studied here indicate that the mass discrepancy still seems\nto hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 12:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We find that both absorption systems are\ncomposed of several narrow subcomponents with CIV/OVI Doppler-parameters b<10\nkm/s, typically. This implies that the gas temperatures are T<10^5 K and that\nthe absorbers are photoionized by the UV background. The system at z=2.1098\nrepresents a simple, isolated OVI absorber that has only two absorption\ncomponents and that is relatively metal-rich (Z\\sim 0.6 solar). Ioinization\nmodeling implies that the system is photoionized with OVI, CIV, and HI\ncoexisting in the same gas phase. The second system at z=2.1660 represents a\ncomplicated, multi-component absorption system with eight OVI components\nspanning almost 300 km/s in radial velocity. The photoionization modeling\nimplies that the metallicity is non-uniform and relatively low (<= 0.1 solar)\nand that the OVI absorption must arise in a gas phase different from that\ntraced by CIV, CIII, and HI. Our detailed study of the two OVI systems towards\nPKS1448-232 shows that multi-phase, multi-component high-ion absorbers like the\none at z=2.1660 require a detailed ionization modeling of the various\nsubcomponents to obtain reliable results on the physical conditions and\nmetal-abundances in the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 12:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Such methods\nare not only applicable to stellar streams, but also to HI streams residing in\nthe Milky Way halo. Here, I present the results of two studies that use radial\nvelocity gradients to determine the system's orbit: for Hercules, one of the\n'ultra-faint' dwarf galaxies exhibiting a large ellipticity and located at a\ndistance of 140kpc, showing that it may in fact be a stellar stream, and for a\nstring of high-velocity HI clouds belonging to the GCN complex, indicating its\nlikelihood for being a gaseous stream at a distance of approximately 20kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 14:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We relax several\nconstraints which were often imposed in previous works: the magnetic field does\nnot have to share a common symmetry axis with the spin of the black hole but\nthey can be inclined with respect to each other, thus violating the axial\nsymmetry. Also, the black hole does not have to remain at rest but it can\ninstead perform fast translational motion together with rotation. We\ndemonstrate that the generalization brings new effects. Starting from uniform\nelectro-vacuum fields in the curved spacetime, we find separatrices and\nidentify magnetic neutral points forming in certain circumstances. We suggest\nthat these structures can represent signatures of magnetic reconnection\ntriggered by frame-dragging effects in the ergosphere.
