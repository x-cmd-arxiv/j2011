It appeared\nimportant to get a precise knowledge of these scan parameters' normal values\nduring the first trimester. This paper focused on crown-rump length. ---\nMETHODS --- 402 pregnancies from in-vitro fertilization allowing a precise\nestimation of foetal ages (FA) were used to determine the best model that\ndescribes crown-rump length (CRL) as a function of FA. Scan measures by a\nsingle operator from 3846 spontaneous pregnancies representative of the general\npopulation from Northern France were used to build a mathematical model linking\nFA and CRL in a context as close as possible to normal scan screening used in\nDown's syndrome likelihood determination. We modeled both CRL as a function of\nFA and FA as a function of CRL. For this, we used a clear methodology and\nperformed regressions with heteroskedastic corrections and robust regressions.\nThe results were compared by cross-validation to retain the equations with the\nbest predictive power. We also studied the errors between observed and\npredicted values. --- Results --- Data from 513 spontaneous pregnancies allowed\nto model CRL as a function of age of foetal age. The best model was a\npolynomial of degree 2. Datation with our equation that models spontaneous\npregnancies from a general population was in quite agreement with objective\ndatations obtained from 402 IVF pregnancies and thus support the validity of\nour model. The most precise measure of CRL was when the SD was minimal\n(1.83mm), for a CRL of 23.6 mm where our model predicted a 49.4 days of foetal\nage. Our study allowed to model the SD from 30 to 90 days of foetal age and\noffers the opportunity of using Zscores in the future to detect growth\nabnormalities. --- Conclusion --- With powerful statistical tools we report a\ngood modeling of the first trimester embryonic growth in the general population\nallowing a better knowledge of the date of fertilization useful in the\nultrasound screening of Down's syndrome. The optimal period to measure CRL and\npredict foetal age was 49.4 days (9 weeks of gestational age).

For\nthis reason, many methods to compute a common mean and its uncertainty were\nproposed, each with own advantages and shortcomings. Most of them are variants\nof the weighted average (WA) approach with different strategies to compute WA\nand its standard deviation. Median estimate became also increasingly popular\nduring recent years. In this paper, these two methods in most widely used\nmodifications are compared using simulated and real data. To overcome some\nproblems of known approaches to compute the WA uncertainty, a new combined\nestimate has been proposed. It has been shown that the proposed method can help\nto obtain more robust and realistic estimate suitable for both consistent and\ndiscrepant measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2011 19:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

All\ntilings with at most 8 superpotential terms have been generated using an\nimplementation of this method.\n  Orbifolds are a subject of central importance in string theory. It is widely\nknown that there may be two or more orbifolds of a space by a finite group.\nAbelian Calabi-Yau orbifolds of the form $\\BC^3 / \\Gamma$ can be counted\naccording to the size of the group $|\\Gamma|$. Three methods of counting these\norbifolds will be given.\n  A brane tiling together with a set of Chern Simons levels is sufficient to\ndefine a quiver Chern-Simons theory which describes the worldvolume theory of\nthe M2-brane probe. A forward algorithm exists which allows us to easily\ncompute the toric data associated to the moduli space of the quiver\nChern-Simons theory from knowledge of the tiling and Chern-Simons levels. This\nforward algorithm will be discussed and illustrated with a few examples. It is\npossible that two different Chern-Simons theories have the same moduli-space.\nThis effect, sometimes known as `toric duality' will be described further. We\nwill explore how two Chern--Simons theories (corresponding to brane tilings)\ncan be related to each other by the Higgs mechanism and how brane tilings (with\nCS levels) that correspond to 14 fano 3-folds have been constructed.\n  The idea of `child' and `parent' brane tilings will be introduced and we will\ndiscuss how it has been possible to count `children' using the symmetry of the\n`parent' tiling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2011 21:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

Using homogenization techniques, a reduced stochastic\nparametrization model is derived for the slow dynamics. The reliability of this\nreduced climate model in reproducing the statistics of the slow dynamics of the\nfull deterministic model for finite values of the time scale separation is\nnumerically established. The statistics however is sensitive to uncertainties\nin the parameters of the stochastic model. It is investigated whether the\nstochastic climate model can be beneficial as a forecast model in an ensemble\ndata assimilation setting, in particular in the realistic setting when\nobservations are only available for the slow variables. The main result is that\nreduced stochastic models can indeed improve the analysis skill, when used as\nforecast models instead of the perfect full deterministic model. The stochastic\nclimate model is far superior at detecting transitions between regimes. The\nobservation intervals for which skill improvement can be obtained are related\nto the characteristic time scales involved. The reason why stochastic climate\nmodels are capable of producing superior skill in an ensemble setting is due to\nthe finite ensemble size; ensembles obtained from the perfect deterministic\nforecast model lacks sufficient spread even for moderate ensemble sizes.\nStochastic climate models provide a natural way to provide sufficient ensemble\nspread to detect transitions between regimes. This is corroborated with\nnumerical simulations.

In this paper, we present an\nalgebraic approach to SCSI based on the list decoding of the underlying channel\ncodes. We show that the theoretical limit of SCSI can be achieved in the\nproposed list decoding based framework when the correlation between the source\nand side information is $q$-ary symmetric. We argue that, as opposed to channel\ncoding, the correct sequence from the list produced by the list decoder can\neffectively be recovered in case of SCSI with a few CRC symbols. The CRC\nsymbols, which allow the decoder to identify the correct sequence, incur\nnegligible overhead for large block lengths. More importantly, these CRC\nsymbols are not subject to noise since we are dealing with a virtual noisy\nchannel rather than a real noisy channel. Finally, we present a guideline for\ndesigning constructive SCSI schemes for non-binary and binary sources using\nReed Solomon codes and BCH codes, respectively. This guideline allows us to\ndesign a SCSI scheme for any arbitrary $q$-ary symmetric correlation without\nresorting to simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 05:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

While there is\ngeneral consensus that the flux modulation is due to variable shading of the\nX-ray emitting regions on the surface of the neutron star by the precessing\naccretion disk, the physical reason for the variation of the pulse profiles had\nremained controversial. Following the suggestion by Truemper et al. (1986) that\nfree precession of the neutron star may be responsible for the variation of the\npulse profiles, we had developed physical models of strong feedback interaction\nbetween the neutron star and the accretion disk in order to explain the\nseemingly identical values for the periods of the two types of variations. In a\ndeep analysis of pulse profiles observed by several different satellites over\nthe last three decades we find now that the clock behind the pulse profile\nvariations shows exactly the same erratic behavior as the turn-on clock, even\non short time scales (100 d), suggesting that there may in fact be only one 35\nd clock in the system. If this is true, it presents a serious challenge for the\nidea of free precession of the neutron star and calls for alternative physical\nmodels for the variation in pulse shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 08:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

Incommensurate antiferromagnetic order with the\npropagation vector k1 = (0, 0.485, 0.055) sets in at 26 K. A transition to a\nsecond antiferromagnetic structure with k2 = (0, 0, 0) takes place at 21.1 K.\nMoreover, a transition to a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with k3 =\n(0, 0.5, 0.25) occurs at 17.4 K. The magnetic structures have been determined\nby neutron powder diffraction using group theory analysis as a preliminary\ntool. Different coordinations of the Co2+ ions involved in the low-symmetry\nC2/c structure of Co3TeO6 render the exchange-interaction network very complex\nby itself.

We consider a distributed channel state\ninformation (DCSI) configuration where each TX has its own local estimate of\nthe overall multiuser MIMO channel. The focus of this work is on the\noptimization of the allocation of the CSI feedback subject to a constraint on\nthe total sharing through the backhaul network. Building upon the Wyner model,\nwe derive a new approach to allocate the CSI feedback while making efficient\nuse of the pathloss structure to reduce the amount of feedback necessary. We\nshow that the proposed CSI allocation achieves good performance with only a\nnumber of CSI bits per TX which does not scale with the number of cooperating\nTXs, thus making the joint transmission from a large number of TXs more\npractical than previously thought. Indeed, the proposed CSI allocation reduces\nthe cooperation to a local scale, which allows also for a reduced allocation of\nthe user's data symbols. We further show that the approach can be extended to a\nmore general class of channel: the exponentially decaying channels, which model\naccuratly the cooperation of TXs located on a one dimensional space. Finally,\nwe verify by simulations that the proposed CSI allocation leads to very little\nperformance losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 12:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

Methods: We use chi2-fitting to fit SDSS galaxy spectra with the\nsynthetic library in order to construct a semi-empirical library of galaxy\nspectra in which (1) the real spectra are extended by the synthetic ones in\norder to cover the full wavelength range of Gaia, and (2) astrophysical\nparameters are assigned to the SDSS spectra by the best fitting synthetic\nspectrum.

We then state and prove the Naimark\ntheorem, which elucidates the connections between generalized and standard\nmeasurements and illustrates how a generalized measurement may be physically\nimplemented. The \"impossibility\" of a joint measurement of two non commuting\nobservables is revisited and its canonical implementations as a generalized\nmeasurement is described in some details. Finally, we address the basic\nproperties, usually captured by the request of unitarity, that a map\ntransforming quantum states into quantum states should satisfy to be physically\nadmissible, and introduce the notion of complete positivity (CP). We then state\nand prove the Stinespring/Kraus-Choi-Sudarshan dilation theorem and elucidate\nthe connections between the CP-maps description of quantum operations, together\nwith their operator-sum representation, and the customary unitary description\nof quantum evolution. We also address transposition as an example of positive\nmap which is not completely positive, and provide some examples of generalized\nmeasurements and quantum operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 14:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2012 08:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Stellar winds from\nmassive stars and their explosions as SNs shape the ISM and trigger star\nformation. Studying evolved stars is fundamental for understanding galaxy\nformation and evolution, at any redshift. We aim to establish a photometric\nclassification scheme for Galactic mass-losing evolved stars (e.g., WR, RSG,\nand AGB stars) with the goal of identifying new ones, and subsequently to use\nthe sample as tracers of Galactic structure. We searched for counterparts of\nknown Galactic WR, LBV, RSG, and O-rich AGBs in the 2MASS, GLIMPSE, and MSX\ncatalogs, and we analyzed their properties with near- and mid-infrared\ncolor-color diagrams. We used the Q1 parameter, which measures the deviation\nfrom the interstellar reddening vector in the J-H versus H-Ks diagram, and we\ndefined a new parameter, Q2, that measures the deviation from the interstellar\nreddening vector in the J-Ks versus Ks-[8.0] diagram. The latter plane enables\nto distinguish between interstellar and circumstellar reddening, and to\nidentify stars with envelopes. WR stars and late-type mass-losing stars are\ndistributed in two different regions of the Q1 versus Ks-[8.0] diagram. A\nsequence of increasing [3.6]-[4.5] and [3.6]-[8.0] colors with increasing\npulsation amplitudes (SRs, Miras, and OH/IRs) is found.
