In this process the spin tunnels from the lowest\nstate near one easy direction to the first excited state near the opposite easy\ndirection, and subsequently decays to the second easy direction with the\nemission of a phonon, or it first emits a phonon and then tunnels to the final\nstate. This mechanism is the simplest imaginable one that allows magnetization\nrelaxation in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field that is so large\nthat the nuclear spin environment cannot absorb the energy required for energy\nconservation to hold. It is proposed as a way of understanding both\nmagnetization realaxation and Landau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg experiments. The\nrequisite Fermi golden rule rate, and the spin-flip rates are calculated, and\nit is found that these rates are much too low by several orders of magnitude.\nThus the understanding of magnetic relaxation in the experiments remains an\nopen question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2011 16:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

To date, the CS theory has focused on real-valued measurements, but in\npractice, measurements are mapped to bits from a finite alphabet.

It is shown that, the negativity of the Wigner function of\nthe photonic state unquestionably vanishes with the cavity's dissipation. As a\nconsequence, the nonclassical effects related to the negativity of the Wigner\nfunction should be weakened gradually. However, it is found that the value of\nthe second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ (which serves usually as the\nstandard criterion of a typical nonclassical effect, i.e., $g^{(2)}(0)<1$\nimplies that the photon is anti-bunching) is a dynamical invariant during the\ndissipative process of the cavity. This feature is also proven analytically and\nsuggests that $g^{(2)}(0)$ might not be a good physical parameter to describe\nthe photonic decays. Alternatively, we find that the anti-normal-order\ncorrelation function $g^{(2A)}(0)$ changes with the cavity's dissipation and\nthus is more suitable to describe the dissipative-dependent cavity.

This thesis extends upon the previously proposed discriminatory channel\nestimation (DCE) scheme that allows only the transmitter to send training\nsignals. The goal of DCE is to minimize the channel estimation error at LR\nwhile requiring the channel estimation error at UR to remain beyond a certain\nlevel. If the training signal is sent only by the transmitter, the performance\ndiscrimination between LR and UR will be limited since the training signals\nhelp both receivers perform estimates of their downlink channels. In this work,\nwe consider instead the two-way training methodology that allows both the\ntransmitter and LR to send training signals. In this case, the training signal\nsent by LR helps the transmitter obtain knowledge of the transmitter-to-LR\nchannel, but does not help UR estimate its downlink channel (i.e., the\ntransmitter-to-UR channel). With transmitter knowledge of the estimated\ntransmitter-to-LR channel, artificial noise (AN) can then be embedded in the\nnull space of the transmitter-to-LR channel to disrupt UR's channel estimation\nwithout severely degrading the channel estimation at LR. Based on these ideas,\ntwo-way DCE training schemes are developed for both reciprocal and\nnon-reciprocal channels. The optimal power allocation between training and AN\nsignals is devised under both average and individual power constraints.\nNumerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\ntwo-way DCE training schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 07:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}

We provide a comprehensive and\ngeneral framework for dc conductance measurements that provides a path to\nimproving the accuracy of existing data and obtaining useful additional data. A\nkey aspect is that dc conductance measurements can be used to map the energy of\nthe 1D subband edges directly, giving new insight into the physics that takes\nplace as the spin-split 1D subbands populate. Through a re-analysis of the data\nobtained by Chen et al, we obtain two findings. The first is that the 2-down\nsubband edge closely tracks the source chemical potential when it first begins\npopulating before dropping more rapidly in energy. The second is that the 2-up\nsubband populates more rapidly as the subband edge approaches the drain\npotential. This second finding suggests that the spin-gap may stop opening, or\neven begin to close again, as the 2-up subband continues populating, consistent\nwith recent theoretical calculations and experimental studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 11:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}

An appealing example discussed in the paper is\nthe interaction of a deuteron beam with a target of deuterated metal Ta. In\nthese experiments, the reaction cross section for d(d,p)t was shown to be\norders of magnitude greater than what the conventional model predicts for the\nlow-energy particles. In this paper we take into account the influence of\nquantum effects due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for particles in a\nnon-ideal medium elastically interacting with the medium particles. In order to\ncalculate the nuclear reaction rate in the non-ideal environment we apply both\nthe Monte Carlo technique and approximate analytical calculation of the Feynman\ndiagram using nonrelativistic kinetic Green's functions in the medium which\ncorrespond to the generalized energy and momentum distribution functions of\ninteracting particles.
