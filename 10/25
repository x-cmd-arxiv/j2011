This lifting theorem is similar to the one of Grothendieck Galois\ntheory [4] for a finite sets valued functor. On the other hand, Joyal and\nStreet [1] work on the algebraic side of the duality between algebra and\ngeometry, and also obtain a lifting-equivalence, but now to the category of\nfinite-dimensional comodules over a Hopf algebra.

The orbital\ninclination is known from spectroscopic observations of moving lines; the\ndistance is derived from radio interferometry of relativistic jets; the mass\nratio of its components is determined from X-ray observations of jets'\neclipses. In 2005, the accretion donor was detected as an A4 - A8 giant, and\nits contribution to eclipse light was measured spectroscopically. In the\npresent paper, the A-type star was detected via multicolor photometry on the\nbasis of its Balmer jump. A method is proposed to estimate the interstellar\nreddening, able to measure the individual law of interstellar absorption for SS\n433 from spectrophotometry. The method is based on extracting the energy\ndistribution of the spectral component of a very hot source covered in eclipse\nand on the comparison of its energy distribution to the Planck energy\ndistribution of a black body with the temperature exceeding 10^6 K. The\ndetermination of general parameters of SS 433 leads to fairly accurate\nestimates of luminosity, radius, and mass of the A star in the system, and\nconsequently leads to an accurate estimate of the mass of the compact\ncomponent, the source of jets.

Unlike the apparent superluminal\noutward motions usually observed in blazars, most, if not all, jet components\nin these sources appear to be stationary with respect to the core, while\nexhibiting strong changes in their position angles. As a result, the jet ridge\nlines of these sources evolve substantially, at times forming a wide\nchannel-flow. We investigate the Caltech-Jodrell Bank flat-spectrum (CJF)\nsample of radio-loud active galaxies to study this new kinematic scenario for\nflat-spectrum AGN. We develop a number of tools that extract information about\nthe apparent linear and angular evolution of the CJF jet ridge lines, as well\nas their morphology. In this way, we study both radial and non-radial apparent\nmotions in the CJF jets. We find that approximately half of the sample shows\nappreciable apparent jet widths ($>10 degrees$), with BL Lac jet ridge lines\nshowing significantly larger apparent widths than both quasars and radio\ngalaxies. In addition, BL Lac jet ridge lines are found to change their\napparent width more strongly. Finally, BL Lac jet ridge lines show the least\napparent linear evolution, which translates to the smallest apparent expansion\nspeeds for their components. We find compelling evidence supporting a\nsubstantially different kinematic scenario for flat-spectrum radio-AGN jets and\nin particular for BL Lac objects. In addition, we find that variability is\nclosely related to the properties of a source's jet ridge line.

One suggested explanation for this\ndiscrepancy is the additional perturbations of the path of the light ray caused\nby matter density fluctuations along the line of sight. We investigate this by\ncalculating the statistical expectation value for the angular deflections\ncaused by density fluctuations, which can be done given the matter power\nspectrum. We find that density fluctuations can, indeed, produce deflections of\na few arcsec. We also find that the deflection angle of a particular image is\nexpected to increase with source redshift and with the angular distance on the\nsky to the lens. Since the light rays of neighbouring images pass through much\nthe same density fluctuations, it turns out that the images' expected\ndeflection angles can be highly correlated. This implies that line-of-sight\ndensity fluctuations are a significant and possibly dominant systematic for\nstrong lensing mass modeling and set a lower limit to how well a cluster mass\nmodel can be expected to replicate the observed image positions.

Although the star does display a radial velocity signal at the period\nof the planet, this has been difficult to disentangle from the intrinsic\nstellar variability, and pinning down the velocity amplitude has been very\nchallenging. As a result, the precise value of the mass of the planet - and\neven the extent to which it can be considered to be confirmed - have been\ndebated in the recent literature, with six mass measurements published so far\nbased on the same spectroscopic observations, ranging from about 2 to 8 Earth\nmasses.

Empirical data indicate that this hypothesis works well in stable\nsituations but, in abrupt transitions such as during an economical crisis, the\nrandom walk model fails and alternative descriptions are needed. For this\nreason, several proposals have been recently forwarded which are based on the\nformalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper we apply the 'SCoP formalism',\nelaborated to provide an operational foundation of quantum mechanics, to the\nstock market. We argue that a stock market is an intrinsically contextual\nsystem where agents' decisions globally influence the market system and stocks\nprices, determining a nonclassical behavior. More specifically, we maintain\nthat a given stock does not generally have a definite value, e.g., a price, but\nits value is actualized as a consequence of the contextual interactions in the\ntrading process. This contextual influence is responsible of the\nnon-Kolmogorovian quantum-like behavior of the market at a statistical level.\nThen, we propose a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement formalism'\nthat describes a buying/selling process of a stock and shows that it is\nintuitively reasonable to assume that the stock has not a definite price until\nit is traded. This result is relevant in our opinion since it provides a\ntheoretical support to the use of quantum models in finance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 20:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

However, Wiesner's scheme required a central bank to verify\nthe money, and the question of whether there can be unclonable quantum money\nthat anyone can verify has remained open since. One can also ask a related\nquestion, which seems to be new: can quantum states be used as copy-protected\nprograms, which let the user evaluate some function f, but not create more\nprograms for f? This paper tackles both questions using the arsenal of modern\ncomputational complexity. Our main result is that there exist quantum oracles\nrelative to which publicly-verifiable quantum money is possible, and any family\nof functions that cannot be efficiently learned from its input-output behavior\ncan be quantumly copy-protected. This provides the first formal evidence that\nthese tasks are achievable. The technical core of our result is a\n\"Complexity-Theoretic No-Cloning Theorem,\" which generalizes both the standard\nNo-Cloning Theorem and the optimality of Grover search, and might be of\nindependent interest. Our security argument also requires explicit\nconstructions of quantum t-designs.

Second, we tested\nthe systems ecology hypothesis that indirect relationships homogenize the\nfunctional importance of species in ecosystems. Our results support both\nhypotheses and highlight the importance of detritus and nutrient recyclers such\nas fungi and bacteria in generating the energy--matter flow in ecosystems. Our\nhomogenization results suggest that indirect effects are important in part\nbecause they tend to even the importance of species in ecosystems. A core\ncontribution of this work is that it creates a formal, mathematical method to\nquantify the importance species play in generating ecosystem activity by\nintegrating direct, indirect, and boundary effects in ecological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 00:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-28"}

The canonical measure\nof this is the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r. For single-field\nslow-roll models of inflation with small field excursions, the Lyth bound\ndictates that if the evolution of the slow-roll parameter epsilon is monotonic,\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio must be below observationally detectable levels. We\ndescribe how non-monotonic evolution of epsilon can evade the Lyth bound and\ngenerate observationally large r, even with small field excursions. This has\nconsequences for the scalar power spectrum as it necessarily predicts an\nenhancement in the spectrum at very small scales and significant\nscale-dependent running at CMB scales. This effect has not been appropriately\naccounted for in previous analyses.

The preservation of\nthe topological structure of the field lines in these solutions has previously\nbeen ascribed to the fact that the electric and magnetic helicity, a measure of\nthe degree of linking and knotting between field lines, are conserved. Here we\nshow that the elegant evolution of the field is due to the stricter condition\nthat the electric and magnetic fields be everywhere orthogonal. The field lines\nthen satisfy a `frozen field' condition and evolve as if they were unbreakable\nfilaments embedded in a fluid. The preservation of the orthogonality of the\nelectric and magnetic field lines is guaranteed for null, shear-free fields\nsuch as the ones considered here by a theorem of Robinson. We calculate the\nflow field of a particular solution and find it to have the form of a Hopf\nfibration moving at the speed of light in a direction opposite to the\npropagation of the pulsed light beam, a familiar structure in this type of\nsolution. The difference between smooth evolution of individual field lines and\nconservation of electric and magnetic helicity is illustrated by considering a\nfurther example in which the helicities are conserved, but the field lines are\nnot everywhere orthogonal. The field line configuration at time t=0 corresponds\nto a nested family of torus knots but unravels upon evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 04:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

However, in practical scenarios purely\nintensity based approaches suffer from uncontrollable environmental conditions\nlike cluttered background colors. In this paper we present a real-time hand\nsegmentation and tracking algorithm using Time-of-Flight (ToF) range cameras\nand intensity data. The intensity and range information is fused into one pixel\nvalue, representing its combined intensity-depth homogeneity. The scene is\nhierarchically clustered using a GPU based parallel merging algorithm, allowing\na robust identification of both hands even for inhomogeneous backgrounds. After\nthe detection, both hands are tracked on the CPU. Our tracking algorithm can\ncope with the situation that one hand is temporarily covered by the other hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 09:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-26"}

Radial-velocity\nmeasurements, taken with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the OHP, and Kepler\nphotometry (Q1 and Q2 data) were used to derive the orbital, stellar and\nplanetary parameters.

The fraction-free approach gives us more information\non the system of linear functional equations and its solutions, than the\nclassical setup of an operator algebra with rational functions coefficients. In\nparticular, one can handle distributional solutions together with, say,\nmeromorphic ones. We investigate Ore localizations of common operator algebras\nover $K[x]$ and use them in the unimodularity analysis of transformation\nmatrices $U,V$. In turn, this allows to lift the isomorphism of modules over an\nOLGA Euclidean domain to a polynomial subring of it. We discuss the relation of\nthis lifting with the solutions of the original system of equations. Moreover,\nwe prove some new results concerning normal forms of matrices over non-simple\ndomains. Our implementation in the computer algebra system {\\sc\nSingular:Plural} follows the fraction-free strategy and shows impressive\nperformance, compared with methods which directly use fractions. Since we\nexperience moderate swell of coefficients and obtain simple transformation\nmatrices, the method we propose is well suited for solving nontrivial practical\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 11:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The periodic change in motility is\nassumed to be induced by the periodic stimulation by the chemoattractant on the\nbasis of previous observations. Consequently, net migration of the cell occurs\nin a particular direction with respect to wave propagation, which explains the\nmigration of Dictyostelium cells in aggregation processes.

For an irreducible, OM-reversible Markov chain on a finite state\nspace, we prove that the stationary distribution satisfies order of magnitude\ndetailed balance (analog of detailed balance in reversible Markov chains). The\nresult characterizes the states with positive probability in the limit of the\nstationary distribution as $\\ep \\to 0$, which finds an important application in\nthe case of singularly perturbed Markov chains that are reducible for $\\ep=0$.\nWe show that OM-reversibility occurs naturally in macroscopic systems,\ninvolving many interacting particles. Clustering is a common phenomenon in\nbiological systems, in which particles or molecules aggregate at one location.\nWe give a simple condition on the transition probabilities in an interacting\nparticle Markov chain that characterizes clustering. We show that such\nclustering processes are OM-reversible, and we find explicitly the order of\nmagnitude of the stationary distribution.

These two forms correspond to two different definitions of\ntrigonometric functions, one geometrical using right triangles and unit\ncircles, and the other employing differential equations. Although the two\ndefinitions must be equivalent, this equivalence is not demonstrated in\ntextbooks. In this manuscript, the equivalence between the geometrical and the\ndifferential definition is presented assuming no a priori knowledge of the\nproperties of sine and cosine functions. We start with the usual length\nprojections on the unit circle and use elementary geometry and elementary\ncalculus to arrive to harmonic differential equations. This more general and\nabstract treatment not only reveals the equivalence of the two definitions but\nalso provides an instructive perspective on circular and harmonic motion as\nstudied in kinematics. This exercise can help develop an appreciation of\nabstract thinking in physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 03:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}
