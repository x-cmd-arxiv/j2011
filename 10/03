The relaxation time of neutrons is larger while that of\nprotons is smaller in neutron-rich nuclear matter compared with that in\nsymmetric nuclear matter, and this leads to a larger specific viscosity in\nneutron-rich nuclear matter. In addition, the specific viscosity decreases with\nincreasing temperature because of more frequent collisions and weaker Pauli\nblocking effect at higher temperatures. At lower temperatures the specific\nviscosity increases with increasing density due to the Pauli blocking effect,\nwhile at higher temperatures it slightly decreases with increasing density as a\nresult of smaller in-medium effective masses at higher densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2011 16:19:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 17:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}

It is an example of noncommutative\nspacetime admitting two fundamental scales besides the speed of light, and is\ninvariant under the action of the de Sitter group. Here we consider its\nnonrelativistic counterpart, i.e. the Snyder model restricted to a\nthree-dimensional sphere, and the related model obtained by considering the\nanti-Snyder model on a pseudosphere, that we call anti-Snyder-de Sitter (aSdS).\n  By means of a nonlinear transformation relating the SdS phase space variables\nto canonical ones, we are able to investigate the classical and the quantum\nmechanics of a free particle and of an oscillator in this framework. As in\ntheir flat space limit, the SdS and aSdS models exhibit rather different\nproperties. In the SdS case, a lower bound on the localization in position and\nmomentum space arises, which is not present in the aSdS model. In the aSdS\ncase, instead, a specific combination of position and momentum coordinates\ncannot exceed a constant value.\n  We explicitly solve the classical and the quantum equations for the motion of\nthe free particle and of the harmonic oscillator. In both the SdS and aSdS\ncases, the frequency of the harmonic oscillator acquires a dependence on the\nenergy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2011 16:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2012 09:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-24"}

Such a signal could be produced by a nearby spinning and\nslightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our galaxy. After recent\nimprovements in the search program that yielded a 10x increase in computational\nefficiency, we have searched in two years of data collected during LIGO's fifth\nscience run and have obtained the most sensitive all-sky upper limits on\ngravitational wave strain to date. Near 150 Hz our upper limit on worst-case\nlinearly polarized strain amplitude $h_0$ is 1e-24, while at the high end of\nour frequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of 3.8e-24 for all\npolarizations and sky locations. These results constitute a factor of two\nimprovement upon previously published data. A new detection pipeline utilizing\na Loosely Coherent algorithm was able to follow up weaker outliers, increasing\nthe volume of space where signals can be detected by a factor of 10, but has\nnot revealed any gravitational wave signals. The pipeline has been tested for\nrobustness with respect to deviations from the model of an isolated neutron\nstar, such as caused by a low-mass or long-period binary companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2011 18:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

Many phenomena\nexhibit irregular diffusive behavior, called anomalous diffusion. Examples of\nanomalous diffusion have been observed in physics, hydrology, biology, and\nfinance, among many other fields. Continuous-time random walks (CTRWs),\nintroduced by Montroll and Weiss, serve as models for anomalous diffusion.\nCTRWs generalize the usual random walk model by allowing random waiting times\nbetween successive random jumps. Under certain conditions on the jumps and\nwaiting times, scaled CTRWs can be shown to converge in distribution to a limit\nprocess M(t) in the cadlag space D[0,infinity) with the Skorohod J_1 or M_1\ntopology.

The resulting HTSC ground\nstate is strongly correlated insulator with not fully filled exciton-electronic\nband, where the incoherent electron transport is impossible but coherent\nsuperconducting transport is possible because the band is not fully occupied.\nIt is shown also that such electronic system is inherently predisposed to\nsuperconductive pairing because each pair of nearest cations acts as a two-atom\nnegative-U center. The nature of Fermi arcs and mechanism of pseudogap are\nconsidered. It is shown that both of these features result from d-wave pairing\nand therefore have to be observed only in cuprates.

These include consideration of (i)\ntime-dependent radiative transfer interaction between the 2^1 P_1 - 1^1 S_0 and\n2^3 P_1 - 1^1 S_0 resonances; (ii) time-dependent radiative transfer for the\npartially overlapping n^1 P_1 - 1^1 S_0, n^1 D_2 - 1^1 S_0 and n^3 P_1 - 1^1\nS_0 series with 3 <= n <= 10; (iii) electron scattering within a kernel\napproach. We also briefly discuss the effect of electron scattering and HI\nquadrupole lines on the recombination of hydrogen. Although the physics of all\nthe considered processes is interesting and subtle, for the standard cosmology,\nwith Y_p \\sim 0.24, the overall correction to the ionization history during\nhelium recombination with respect to the previous implementation of CosmoRec\nremains smaller than |DeltaNe/Ne| \\sim 0.05%. The dominant improvement is\ncaused by consistent inclusion of resonance scattering for the 2^1 P_1 - 1^1\nS_0 resonance. For cosmologies with a large helium fraction, Y_p \\sim 0.4, the\ndifference reaches |D N_e/N_e|\\sim 0.22% at z\\sim1800, however, the overall\ncorrection to the CMB power spectra is small, exceeding |D C_l/C_l| \\sim 0.05 %\nonly at l>\\sim 3000.

In real-world applications,\nhowever, face images usually suffer from expressions, disguises and random\nocclusions. The problematic facial parts undermine the validity of the\nlinear-subspace assumption and thus the recognition performance deteriorates\nsignificantly. In this work, we address the problem in a\nlearning-inference-mixed fashion. By observing that the linear-subspace\nassumption is more reliable on certain face patches rather than on the holistic\nface, some Bayesian Patch Representations (BPRs) are randomly generated and\ninterpreted according to the Bayes' theory. We then train an ensemble model\nover the patch-representations by minimizing the empirical risk w.r.t the\n\"leave-one-out margins\". The obtained model is termed Optimal Representation\nEnsemble (ORE), since it guarantees the optimality from the perspective of\nEmpirical Risk Minimization. To handle the unknown patterns in test faces, a\nrobust version of BPR is proposed by taking the non-face category into\nconsideration. Equipped with the Robust-BPRs, the inference ability of ORE is\nincreased dramatically and several record-breaking accuracies (99.9% on Yale-B\nand 99.5% on AR) and desirable efficiencies (below 20 ms per face in Matlab)\nare achieved. It also overwhelms other modular heuristics on the faces with\nrandom occlusions, extreme expressions and disguises. Furthermore, to\naccommodate immense BPRs sets, a boosting-like algorithm is also derived. The\nboosted model, a.k.a Boosted-ORE, obtains similar performance to its prototype.\nBesides the empirical superiorities, two desirable features of the proposed\nmethods, namely, the training-determined model-selection and the\ndata-weight-free boosting procedure, are also theoretically verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 04:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In particular, using simulations, we study a variant of the\nAxelrod model on a network with a homophilic rewiring rule imposed.

We then investigate whether the\nintroduction of committed individuals who are rigid in their opinion on a\nparticular issue, can speed up the convergence to consensus on that issue. We\ndemonstrate that as committed agents are added, beyond a critical value of the\ncommitted fraction, the consensus time growth becomes logarithmic in network\nsize $N$.

At the upper and lower\nbounding surfaces, perfectly-conducting boundary conditions are adopted for the\nmagnetic field. Two different levels of thermal stratification are considered.\nIf the magnetic diffusivity is sufficiently small, the convection acts as a\nsmall-scale dynamo. Using a definition for the magnetic Reynolds number $R_M$\nthat is based upon the horizontal integral scale and the horizontally-averaged\nvelocity at the mid-layer of the domain, we find that rotation tends to reduce\nthe critical value of $R_M$ above which dynamo action is observed. Increasing\nthe level of thermal stratification within the layer does not significantly\nalter the critical value of $R_M$ in the rotating calculations, but it does\nlead to a reduction in this critical value in the non-rotating cases. At the\nhighest computationally-accessible values of the magnetic Reynolds number, the\nsaturation levels of the dynamo are similar in all cases, with the mean\nmagnetic energy density somewhere between 4 and 9% of the mean kinetic energy\ndensity.

Away from the boundaries, the rate of stretching\ndue to the flow is much less dependent upon depth in the rotating cases than it\nis in the corresponding non-rotating calculations.

It has been shown that despite an explicit asymmetry inherent to the\nbulk constitutive electromechanical equations which take into account the\nflexoelectric coupling, the electromechanical response for a finite sample is\n\"symmetric\". \"Symmetric\" means that if a sensor and an actuator are made of a\nflexoelectric element, performance of such devices can be characterized by the\nsame effective piezoelectric coefficient. This behavior is consistent with the\nthermodynamic arguments offered earlier, being in conflict with the current\npoint of view on the matter in literature.
