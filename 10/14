It is shown that for any finite travel time,\nthe effective field of the electron is infrared-finite, and that in each order\nof perturbation theory the radiative contributions grow without bound in the\nlarge-time limit. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, factorization of\ndivergent contributions in multi-loop diagrams is proved, and summation of the\nresulting infinite series is performed. It is demonstrated that the effective\nelectromagnetic field of the electron vanishes in the large-time limit, and\nthat this vanishing respects the total charge conservation and the Gauss law.\nIt is concluded that the physical meaning of infrared singularity in the\neffective field is the existence of a peculiar irreversible spreading of\nelectric charges, caused by their interaction with the photon field. This\nspreading exists in vacuum as well as at finite temperature, and shows itself\nin a damping of the off-diagonal elements of the momentum-space density matrix\nof electron, but does not affect its momentum probability distribution.

Hyperfine coupling with the nuclei of the GaAs matrix provides spin\nnon-conservation in the two-dimensional electron gas and determines spin\nrelaxation in the quantum Hall system. This mechanism competes with spin-orbit\ncoupling channels of spin-wave decay and can even dominate in a low-temperature\nregime where $T$ is much smaller than the Zeeman gap. In this case the\nspin-wave relaxation process occurs non-exponentially with time and does not\ndepend on the temperature. The competition of different relaxation channels\nresults in crossovers in the dominant mechanism, leading to non-monotonic\nbehavior of the characteristic relaxation time with the magnetic field.

Obtaining a good estimation of\nwhere wireless devices are located is crucial in wireless network applications\nincluding environment monitoring, geographic routing and topology control. When\nthe positions of the devices are unknown and only local distance information is\ngiven, we need to infer the positions from these local distance measurements.\nThis problem is particularly challenging when we only have access to\nmeasurements that have limited accuracy and are incomplete. We consider the\nextreme case of this limitation on the available information, namely only the\nconnectivity information is available, i.e., we only know whether a pair of\nnodes is within a fixed detection range of each other or not, and no\ninformation is known about how far apart they are. Further, to account for\ndetection failures, we assume that even if a pair of devices is within the\ndetection range, it fails to detect the presence of one another with some\nprobability and this probability of failure depends on how far apart those\ndevices are. Given this limited information, we investigate the performance of\na centralized positioning algorithm MDS-MAP introduced by Shang et al., and a\ndistributed positioning algorithm, introduced by Savarese et al., called\nHOP-TERRAIN.

A thorough study of the\ntransformation properties of the functional with respect to different\nsymmetries is required, as a step preliminary to the adjustment of the coupling\nconstants. Purpose: Determine to which extent the presence of higher-order\nderivatives in the functional can be compatible with the continuity equation.\nIn particular, to study the relations between the validity of the continuity\nequation and invariance of the functional under gauge transformations. Methods:\nDerive conditions for the validity of the continuity equation in the framework\nof time-dependent density functional theory. The conditions apply separately to\nthe four spin-isospin channels of the one-body density matrix. Results: We\nobtained four sets of constraints on the coupling constants of the N3LO energy\ndensity functional that guarantee the validity of the continuity equation in\nall spin-isospin channels. In particular, for the scalar-isoscalar channel, the\nconstraints are the same as those resulting from imposing the standard U(1)\nlocal-gauge-invariance conditions. Conclusions: Validity of the continuity\nequation in the four spin-isospin channels is equivalent to the local-gauge\ninvariance of the energy density functional.

Using\nthe public halo catalogues from the CoDECS simulations -- the largest set of\nN-body experiments to date for such cosmological scenarios -- we estimate the\nclustering and bias functions of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes, both in real-\nand redshift-space. Moreover, we investigate the effects of the dark energy\n(DE) coupling on the geometric and dynamic redshift-space distortions,\nquantifying the difference with respect to the concordance LambdaCDM model. At\nz~0, the spatial properties of CDM haloes in cDE models appear very similar to\nthe LambdaCDM case, even if the cDE models are normalized at last scattering in\norder to be consistent with the latest Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data.\nAt higher redshifts, we find that the DE coupling produces a significant\nscale-dependent suppression of the halo clustering and bias function. This\neffect, that strongly depends on the coupling strength, is not degenerate with\nsigma8 at scales r<5-10 Mpc/h. Moreover, we find that the coupled DE strongly\naffects both the linear distortion parameter, beta, and the pairwise peculiar\nvelocity dispersion, sigma12. Although the models considered in this work are\nfound to be all in agreement with presently available observational data, the\nnext generation of galaxy surveys will be able to put strong constraints on the\nlevel of coupling between DE and CDM exploiting the shape of redshift-space\nclustering anisotropies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 16:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-22"}

With these\nmaps, we explore the variation of the ionized-gas, PAH, and warm-gas (H_2)\nproperties across the sequence and within the galaxies. While the global PAH\ninterband strength and ionized gas flux ratios ([Ne III]/[Ne II]) are similar\nto those of normal star forming galaxies, the distribution of the spatially\nresolved PAH and fine structure line flux ratios is significant different from\none system to the other. Rather than a constant H_2/PAH flux ratio, we find\nthat the relation between the H_2 and PAH fluxes is characterized by a power\nlaw with a roughly constant exponent (0.61+/-0.05) over all merger components\nand spatial scales. While following the same power law on local scales, three\ngalaxies have a factor of ten larger integrated (i.e. global) H_2/PAH flux\nratio than the rest of the sample, even larger than what it is in most nearby\nAGNs. These findings suggest a common dominant excitation mechanism for H_2\nemission over a large range of global H_2/PAH flux ratios in major mergers.\nEarly merger systems show a different distribution between the cold (CO J=1-0)\nand warm (H_2) molecular gas component, which is likely due to the merger\ninteraction. Strong evidence for buried star formation in the overlap region of\nthe merging galaxies is found in two merger systems (NGC6621 and NGC7592) as\nseen in the PAH, [Ne II], [Ne III], and warm gas line emission, but with no\napparent corresponding CO (J=1-0) emission. Our findings also demonstrate that\nthe variations of the physical conditions within a merger are much larger than\nany systematic trends along the Toomre Sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Removing stray light from\nextreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of the Sun's corona is of high astrophysical\nimportance, as it is required to make meaningful determinations of temperatures\nand densities of coronal holes. EUV images tend to be dominated by the\ncomponent of the stray light due to the long-range scatter caused by\nmicroroughness of telescope mirror surfaces, and this component has proven very\ndifficult to measure in pre-flight characterization. In-flight characterization\nheretofore has proven elusive due to the fact that the detected image is\nsimultaneously nonlinear in two unknown functions: the stray light pattern and\nthe true image which would be seen by an ideal telescope. Using a constrained\nblind deconvolution technique that takes advantage of known zeros in the true\nimage provided by a fortuitous lunar transit, we have removed the stray light\nfrom solar images seen by the EUVI instrument on STEREO-B in all four filter\nbands (171, 195, 284, and 304 \\AA). Uncertainty measures of the stray light\ncorrected images, which include the systematic error due to misestimation of\nthe scatter, are provided. It is shown that in EUVI, stray light contributes up\nto 70% of the emission in coronal holes seen on the solar disk, which has\ndramatic consequences for diagnostics of temperature and density and therefore\nestimates of key plasma parameters such as the plasma $\\beta$\\ and ion-electron\ncollision rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 20:11:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 21:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-05"}

The available data provide sufficient\nmaterial with which to re-analyse the first-order model of the magnetic field\ngeometry and to derive abundances of Si, Ti, Fe, Nd, Pr, Mg, Cr, Mn, O, and Ca.\nThe magnetic field structure was modelled with a low-order colinear multipole\nexpansion, using coefficients derived from the observed variations of the field\nstrength with rotation phase. The abundances of several elements were\ndetermined using spectral synthesis. After experiments with a very simple model\nof uniform abundance on each of three rings of equal width in co-latitude and\nsymmetric about the assumed magnetic axis, we decided to model the spectra\nassuming uniform abundances of each element over the stellar surface. The new\nmagnetic field measurements allow us to refine the rotation period of HD 318107\nto P = 9.7088 +/- 0.0007 days. Appropriate magnetic field model parameters were\nfound that very coarsely describe the (apparently rather complex) field moment\nvariations. Spectrum synthesis leads to the derivation of mean abundances for\nthe elements Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Nd, and Pr. All of these elements except\nfor Mg and Ca are strongly overabundant compared to the solar abundance ratios.\nThere is considerable evidence of non-uniformity, for example in the different\nvalues of B_z found using lines of different elements. The present data set,\nwhile limited, is nevertheless sufficient to provide a useful first-order\nassessment of both the magnetic and surface abundance properties of HD 318107,\nmaking it one of the very few magnetic Ap stars of well-known age for which\nboth of these properties have been studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 20:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Namely, we consider a\nclass of phase-incoherent multiple access relay channels (MARC) with both\nnon-causal and causal unidirectional cooperation between encoders, referred to\nas phase-incoherent unidirectional non-causal cooperative MARC (PI-UNCC-MARC),\nand phase-incoherent unidirectional causal cooperative MARC (PI-UCC-MARC)\nrespectively. We also consider phase-incoherent interference channels (PI-IC),\nand interference relay channel (PI-IRC) models in the same context. In all\ncases, the input signals are assumed to undergo non-ergodic phase shifts due to\nthe channel. The shifts are assumed to be unknown to the transmitters and known\nto the receivers as a realistic assumption. Both necessary and sufficient\nconditions in order to reliably send the correlated sources to the destinations\nover the considered channels are derived. In particular, for all of the channel\nmodels, we first derive an outer bound for reliable communication that is\ndefined with respect to the source entropy content (i.e., the triple\n$(H(U|V),H(V|U),H(U,V))$). Then, using {\\em separate} source and channel\ncoding, under specific gain conditions, we establish the same region as the\ninner bound and therefore obtain tight conditions for reliable communication\nfor the specific channel under study. We thus establish a source-channel\nseparation theorem for each channel and conclude that without the knowledge of\nthe phase shifts at the transmitter sides, separation is optimal. It is further\nconjectured that separation in general is optimal for all channel coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 20:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-17"}

The possible non-degenerate pivot operations of the simplex\nmethod in solving a linear program over $P$ can be represented as a special\npolytopal digraph known as an LP digraph. Presently there is no general\ncharacterization of which polytopal digraphs are LP digraphs, although four\nnecessary properties are known: acyclicity, unique sink orientation(USO), the\nHolt-Klee property and the shelling property. The shelling property was\nintroduced by Avis and Moriyama (2009), where two examples are given in $d=4$\ndimensions of polytopal digraphs satisfying the first three properties but not\nthe shelling property. The smaller of these examples has $n=7$ vertices. Avis,\nMiyata and Moriyama(2009) constructed for each $d \\ge 4$ and $n \\ge d+2$, a\n$d$-polytope $P$ with $n$ vertices which has a polytopal digraph which is an\nacyclic USO that satisfies the Holt-Klee property, but does not satisfy the\nshelling property. The construction was based on a minimal such example, which\nhas $d=4$ and $n=6$.

The photometric signal we receive from a star hosting a planet is\nmodulated by the variation of the planet signal with its orbital phase. Such\nphase variations are observed for transiting hot Jupiters with current\ninstrumentation, and have also been measured for one transiting terrestrial\nplanet (Kepler 10 b) and one non-transiting gas giant (Ups A b). Future\ntelescopes (JWST and EChO) will have the capability to measure thermal phase\ncurves of exoplanets including hot rocky planets in transiting and\nnon-transiting configurations, and at different wavelengths. Short-period\nplanets with a mass below 10 R_EARTH are indeed frequent and nearby targets\n(within 10 pc) are already known and more are to be found. Aims. To test the\npossibility to use multi-wavelengths infrared phase curves to constrain the\nradius, the albedo and the orbital inclination of a non-transiting planet with\nno atmosphere and on a 1:1 spin orbit resonance. Methods. We model the thermal\nemission of a synchronous rocky planet with no atmosphere and its apparent\nvariation with the orbital phase for a given orbital inclination. We assume\nthat the planet is detected by radial velocity so its orbital period and\nminimum mass are known. We simulate observed noisy phase curves and then apply\na procedure to retrieve the radius and albedo of the planet and the inclination\nof the orbit. Results. Airless planets can be distinguished from planets having\na dense atmosphere and their radius, albedo and inclination (and therefore true\nmass) can be retrieved from multiband observations with MIRI-JWST and EChO in\nthe 5-15 {\\mu}m range.

The instabilities within the particle bed and at the particle\nlayer interface likely form on the timescale of the shock propagation through\nthe particles. The mesoscale perturbations are manifested at later times in\nexperiments by the formation of coherent clusters of particles or jet-like\nparticle structures, which are aerodynamically stable. A number of different\nmechanisms likely contribute to the jet formation including shock fracturing of\nthe particle bed and particle-particle interactions in the early stages of the\ndense gas-particle flow. Aerodynamic wake effects at later times contribute to\nmaintaining the stability of the jets. The experiments shown in this fluid\ndynamics video were carried out in either spherical or cylindrical geometry and\nillustrate the formation of particle jets during the explosive dispersal\nprocess. The number of jet-like structures that are generated during the\ndispersal of a dry powder bed is compared with the number formed during the\ndispersal of the same volume of water. The liquid dispersal generates a larger\nnumber of jets, but they fragment and dissipate sooner. When the particle bed\nis saturated with water and explosively dispersed, the number of particle jets\nformed is larger than both the dry powder and pure water charges.

The\nalgorithm extends the Martinsson/Rokhlin method developed for 2D boundary\nintegral equations and proceeds in two phases: a precomputation phase,\nconsisting of matrix compression and factorization, followed by a solution\nphase to apply the matrix inverse. For boundary integral equations which are\nnot too oscillatory, e.g., based on the Green's functions for the Laplace or\nlow-frequency Helmholtz equations, both phases typically have complexity O(N)\nin two dimensions, where $N$ is the number of discretization points.

Furthermore, observers\nwill be affected by the history of the collapsed object, and we introduce a\nmethod to calculate the anthropic likelihoods of \\Lambda and Q from the mass\nhistory using the extended Press-Schechter formalism. The anthropic likelihoods\nfor $\\Lambda$ and Q from this method are similar to those from our single mass\nconstraint model, but, unlike models using the single mass constraint which\nalways have degeneracies between \\Lambda and Q, the results from models using\nthe mass history are robust even if we allow both \\Lambda and Q to vary. In the\ncase of Weinberg's flat prior distribution of \\Lambda (pocket based multiverse\nmeasure), our mass history model gives T_+(\\Lambda_0) ~ 10%, while the scale\nfactor cutoff measure and the causal patch measure give T_+(\\Lambda_0) \\geq\n30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 04:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 12:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-13"}

Structure changes including car-bonization and oxidation were\nobserved in the modified surface layer of PE by Raman spec-troscopy, FTIR ATR\nspectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, surface energy measurement and XPS\nspectroscopy. An observed high surface energy of the modified polyethylene was\nattributed to the presence of free radicals on the surface. The surface energy\ndecay with stor-age time after PIII treatment was explained by a decay of the\nfree radical concentration while the concentration of oxygen-containing groups\nincreased with storage time.

A mechanism based on the covalent attachment by the\nreaction of protein with free radicals in the modified surface is proposed.\nAppropriate blocking agents can block this reaction. All aminoacid residues can\ntake part in the covalent attachment process, providing a universal mechanism\nof attachment for all proteins. The long-term activity of the modified layer to\nattach protein (at least 2 years) is explained by stabilisa-tion of unpaired\nelectrons in sp2 carbon structures. The native conformation of attached\npro-tein is retained due to hydrophilic interactions in the interface region. A\nhigh concentration of free radicals on the surface can give multiple covalent\nbonds to the protein molecule and de-stroy the native conformation and with it\nthe catalytic activity.

This can occur directly, as the\ncharacteristics of the GRB-jet are changed by the medium it collides with, and\nindirectly because the GRB can only be observed through the extended\ncircumstellar bubble that surrounds each massive star.\n  We use computer simulations to describe the circumstellar features that can\nbe found in the vicinity of massive stars and discuss if, and how, they may\nappear in GRB observations. Specifically, we make hydrodynamical models of the\ncircumstellar environment of a rapidly rotating, chemically near-homogeneous\nstar, which is represents a GRB progenitor candidate model.\n  The simulations show that the star creates a large scale bubble of shocked\nwind material, which sweeps up the interstellar medium in an expanding shell.\nWithin this bubble, temporary circumstellar shells, clumps and voids are\ncreated as a result of changes in the stellar wind. Most of these temporary\nfeatures have disappeared by the time the star reaches the end of its life,\nleaving a highly turbulent circumstellar bubble behind. Placing the same star\nin a high density environment simplifies the evolution of the CSM as the more\nconfined bubble prohibits the formation of some of the temporary structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 08:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-17"}

The $Z^*$ boson can be observed as a\nBreit-Wigner resonance peak in the invariant dilepton mass distributions in the\nsame way as the well-known extra gauge $Z'$ bosons. However, the $Z^*$ bosons\nhave unique signatures in transverse momentum, angular and pseudorapidity\ndistributions of the final leptons, which allow one to distinguish them from\nother heavy neutral resonances. In 2010, with 40 pb$^{-1}$ of the LHC\nproton-proton data at the energy 7 TeV, the ATLAS detector was used to search\nfor narrow resonances in the invariant mass spectrum of $e^+e^-$ and\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-$ final states and high-mass charged states decaying to a charged\nlepton and a neutrino. No statistically significant excess above the Standard\nModel expectation was observed. The exclusion mass limits of 1.15 TeV$/c^2$ and\n1.35 TeV$/c^2$ were obtained for the chiral neutral $Z^*$ and charged $W^*$\nbosons, respectively. These are the first direct limits on the $W^*$ and $Z^*$\nboson production. For almost all currently considered exotic models the\nrelevant signal is expected in the central dijet rapidity region. On the\ncontrary, the chiral bosons do not contribute to this region but produce an\nexcess of dijet events far away from it. For these bosons the appropriate\nkinematic restrictions lead to a dip in the centrality ratio distribution over\nthe dijet invariant mass instead of a bump expected in the most exotic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 08:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Specifically, we show rigorously that when\nthe secondary structure of a polymer is mostly due to weak non-covalent\ninteractions, the stretching is two-phase, and the force-stretching diagram has\nthe characteristic plateau. We then use realistic coarse-grained models to\nconfirm the main findings and make direct connection to the microscopic\nstructure of the monomers.

Detailed analysis\nof DNA stretching demonstrates that breaking of Watson-Crick bonds is not\nnecessary for the existence of the plateau, although some of the bonds do break\nas the double-helix extends at room temperature.

Elastic scattering of an\nelectron by the bound state is treated as a two-channel problem for a\nBakamjian-Thomas-type mass operator. In this way retardation effects in the\nphoton-exchange interaction are fully taken into account. The electromagnetic\nbound-state current is extracted from the one-photon-exchange optical\npotential. Wrong cluster properties, inherent in the Bakamjian-Thomas framework\nfor more than 2 particles, are seen to cause spurious (unphysical)\ncontributions in the current, which are associated with a dependence on the sum\nof the electron momenta. The Lorentz structure of our current resembles the one\nobtained from an explicitly covariant light-front approach, where spurious\ncontributions also show up and are associated with a four-vector describing the\norientation of the light front. For spin-0 systems, like a charged pion, the\nspurious contributions can be eliminated by choosing the total invariant mass\nof the electron-bound-state system large enough. In this case equivalence with\nthe usual front-form expression for the form factor, resulting from a spectator\ncurrent in the q^+=0 reference frame, is established. For spin-1 systems, like\na charged rho meson or the deuteron, some spurious contributions cannot be\ncompletely eliminated by solely choosing an infinitely large invariant mass.\nNevertheless, there is an unambiguous way how to separate them from the\nphysical contributions such that one is left with a physical bound-state\ncurrent with the required properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 12:04:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 16:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-09"}

It\nwill use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark\nmatter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry\nof the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission\nis optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak\ngravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid\npayload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field\nof view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of ~0.54 deg2:\nthe visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains\na slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey\nwill cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20\ndeg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies\nper arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric\nredshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) < 0.05. They are\nderived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0\nmicron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from\npublic data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a\nspectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless\nspectrometer, with spectral resolution ~250, predominantly detects Ha emission\nline galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision\n2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also\nknown as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 12:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-26"}

Such a priori\nknowledge is common in wireless relay networks. For example, a transmitting\nrelay could be relaying data that was previously transmitted by a node, in\nwhich case the interference received by the node now is actually self\ninformation. Besides the case of self information, the node could also have\noverheard or received the interference data in a prior transmission by another\nnode. Directly removing the known interference requires accurate estimate of\nthe interference channel, which may be difficult in many situations. In this\npaper, we propose a novel scheme, Blind Known Interference Cancellation (BKIC),\nto cancel known interference without interference channel information. BKIC\nconsists of two steps. The first step combines adjacent symbols to cancel the\ninterference, exploiting the fact that the channel coefficients are almost the\nsame between successive symbols. After such interference cancellation, however,\nthe signal of interest is also distorted. The second step recovers the signal\nof interest amidst the distortion. We propose two algorithms for the critical\nsecond steps. The first algorithm (BKIC-S) is based on the principle of\nsmoothing. It is simple and has near optimal performance in the slow fading\nscenario. The second algorithm (BKIC-RBP) is based on the principle of\nreal-valued belief propagation. It can achieve MAP-optimal performance with\nfast convergence, and has near optimal performance even in the fast fading\nscenario. Both BKIC schemes outperform the traditional self-interference\ncancellation schemes with perfect initial channel information by a large\nmargin, while having lower complexities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 13:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-17"}

In this state, the dust acts like a natural coronagraph at visible\nwavelengths, allowing faint nebulosity around the star to be seen. Imaging has\nbeen obtained from 0.5 to 500 micron with Gemini/GMOS, HST/WFPC2, Spitzer/MIPS,\nand Herschel/SPIRE. Several of the structures around R CrB are cometary\nglobules caused by wind from the star streaming past dense blobs. The estimated\ndust mass of the knots is consistent with their being responsible for the R CrB\ndeclines if they form along the line of sight to the star. In addition, there\nis a large diffuse shell extending up to 4 pc away from the star containing\ncool 25 K dust that is detected all the way out to 500 micron. The SED of R CrB\ncan be well fit by a 150 AU disk surrounded by a very large diffuse envelope\nwhich corresponds to the size of the observed nebulosity. The total masses of\nthe disk and envelope are 10^-4 and 2 M(Sun), respectively, assuming a\ngas-to-dust ratio of 100. The evidence pointing toward a white-dwarf merger or\na final-helium-shell flash origin for R CrB is contradictory. The shell and the\ncometary knots are consistent with a fossil planetary nebula. Along with the\nfact that R CrB shows significant Lithium in its atmosphere, this supports the\nfinal-helium-shell flash. However, the relatively high inferred mass of R CrB\nand its high fluorine abundance support a white-dwarf merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 15:04:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 04:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Interestingly, the sharp tip of the\nice drop acts as a preferential site for deposition of water vapour, and a\nbeautiful \"tree\" of ice crystals develops right at the tip.

When oxygen is scarce, carbon\nparticles nucleate into solid particles called soot. These particles emit\nphotons, making the flame yellow. Later, methane is pre-mixed with air forming\na blue flame; burning more efficiently, providing less soot and light.\n  Imaging flames and knowing their temperature are vital to maximizing\nefficiency and validating numerical models. Most temperature probes disrupt the\nflame and create differences leading to an inaccurate measurement of the flame\ntemperature. We seek to image the flame in three dimensions using synthetic\naperture imaging. This technique has already successfully measured velocity\nfields of a vortex ring [1].\n  Synthetic aperture imaging is a technique that views one scene from multiple\ncameras set at different angles, allowing some cameras to view objects that are\nobscured by others. As the resulting images are overlapped different depths of\nthe scene come into and out of focus, known as focal planes, similar to\ntomography. These focal planes can be used to extract three-dimensional\ninformation about the scene. This procedure was used to extract the outer edge\nof a oxygen-starved methane flame (yellow) from which the three-dimensional\nflame was reconstructed. When the reconstructed image was compared to the raw\nimage from the central camera the two shapes corresponded well. This experiment\nin the fluid dynamics video (entry #: V041) demonstrated that a\nthree-dimensional flame can be reconstructed by combining images from multiple\ncameras using synthetic aperture imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 00:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}
