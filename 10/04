Their clustering can be studied through the cosmic\ninfrared background anisotropies. These anisotropies have been measured from\n100 \\mum to 2 mm in the last few years. In this paper, we present a fully\nparametric model allowing a joint analysis of these recent observations. In\norder to develop a coherent model at various wavelengths, we rely on two\nbuilding blocks. The first one is a parametric model that describes the\nredshift evolution of the luminosity function of star-forming galaxies. It\ncompares favorably to measured differential number counts and luminosity\nfunctions. The second one is a halo model based description of the clustering\nof galaxies. Starting from a fiducial model, we investigate parameter\ndegeneracies using a Fisher analysis. We then discuss how halo of different\nmass and redshift, how LIRGs and ULIRGs, contribute to the CIB angular power\nspectra.\n  From the Fisher analysis, we conclude that we cannot constrain the parameters\nof the model of evolution of galaxies using clustering data only. The use of\ncombined data of C\\ell, counts and luminosity functions improves slightly the\nconstraints but does not remove any degeneracies. On the contrary, the\nmeasurement of the anisotropies allows us to set interesting constraints on the\nhalo model parameters, even if some strong degeneracies remain. Using our\nfiducial model, we establish that the 1-halo and 2-halo terms are not sensitive\nto the same mass regime. We also illustrate how the 1-halo term can be\nmisinterpreted with the Poisson noise term. Conclusions. We present a new model\nof the clustering of infrared galaxies. However such a model has a few\nlimitations, as the parameters of the halo occupation suffer from strong\ndegeneracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 16:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 104\n240401 (2010)]. The theory of contextual values extends the well-established\ntheory of generalized state measurements by bridging the gap between partial\nstate collapse and the observables that represent physically relevant\ninformation about the system. To emphasize the general utility of the concept,\nwe first construct the full theory of contextual values within an operational\nformulation of classical probability theory, paying special attention to\nobservable construction, detector coupling, generalized measurement, and\nmeasurement disturbance. We then extend the results to quantum probability\ntheory built as a superstructure on the classical theory, pointing out both the\nclassical correspondences to and the full quantum generalizations of both\nL\\\"uder's rule and the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz rule in the process. We find\nin both cases that the contextual values of a system observable form a\ngeneralized spectrum that is associated with the independent outcomes of a\npartially correlated and generally ambiguous detector; the eigenvalues are a\nspecial case when the detector is perfectly correlated and unambiguous. To\nillustrate the approach, we apply the technique to both a classical example of\nmarble color detection and a quantum example of polarization detection. For the\nquantum example we detail two devices: Fresnel reflection from a glass\ncoverslip, and continuous beam displacement from a calcite crystal. We also\nanalyze the three-box paradox to demonstrate that no negative probabilities are\nnecessary in its analysis.

In locusts, the corresponding escape behavior correlates with the\nactivity of the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) neuron. During an object\napproach, its firing rate was reported to gradually increase until a peak is\nreached, and then it declines quickly. The ETA-function predicts that the LGMD\nactivity is a product between an exponential function of angular size and\nangular velocity, and that peak activity is reached before time-to-contact\n(ttc). The ETA-function has become the prevailing LGMD model because it\nreproduces many experimental observations, and even experimental evidence for\nthe multiplicative operation was reported. Several inconsistencies remain\nunresolved, though. Here we address these issues with a new model (PSI-model),\nwhich explicitly connects angular size and angular velocity to biophysical\nquantities. The PSI-model avoids biophysical problems associated with\nimplementing exp(), implements the multiplicative operation of ETA via divisive\ninhibition, and explains why activity peaks could occur after ttc. It\nconsistently predicts response features of the LGMD, and provides excellent\nfits to published experimental data, with goodness of fit measures comparable\nto corresponding fits with the ETA-function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-04"}

Thus, it is possible\nthat AGN and host star formation could be responsible for some fraction of the\nexcess CRB at 1.4 GHz. Here, an X-ray background population synthesis model is\nused in conjunction with empirical radio to X-ray luminosity ratios to\ncalculate the AGN contribution to the CRB at 1.4 GHz including the emission\nfrom host star formation. It is found that AGN and host star formation\ncontribute <~9% of the CRB at 1.4 GHz. When all known 1.4 GHz radio source\nclasses are considered, <~60% of the CRB at 1.4 GHz is accounted for;\ntherefore, it is necessary that either known radio sources evolve significantly\nat flux densities below current survey sensitivity limits or a new population\nof low flux density radio sources exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 19:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We analyzed the near-infrared photometric and structural\nproperties of a sample of 20 BGGs present in FGs in order to better understand\ntheir formation mechanisms. Their surface-brightness distribution was fitted to\na Sersic profile using the GASP2D algorithm.

The BGGs presented in this study represent a subset of the most\nmassive galaxies in the Universe. We found that their ellipticity profiles are\ncontinuously increasing with the galactocentric radius. Our fossil BCGs follow\nclosely the fundamental plane described by normal ellipticals. However, they\ndepart from both the log \\sigma_0 vs. log L_{K_{s}} and log r_{\\rm e} vs. log\nL_{K_{s}} relations described by intermediate mass ellipticals. This occurs in\nthe sense that our BGGs have larger effective radii and smaller velocity\ndispersions than those predicted by these relations. We also found that more\nelliptical galaxies systematically deviate from the previous relations while\nmore rounder object do not. No similar correlation was found with the Sersic\nindex. The derived scaling relations can be interpreted in terms of the\nformation scenario of the BGGs. Because our BGGs follow the fundamental plane\ntilt but they have larger effective radii than expected for intermediate mass\nellipticals, we suggest that they only went through dissipational mergers in a\nearly stage of their evolution and then assembled the bulk of their mass\nthrough subsequent dry mergers, contrary to previous claims that BGGs in FGs\nwere formed mainly by the merging of gas-rich galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The spectral distortions created\nby Bose-Einstein condensation of photons are within an order of magnitude (for\nthe present range of allowed cosmological parameters), with exactly the same\nspectrum but opposite in sign, of those created by diffusion damping of the\nacoustic waves on small scales corresponding to comoving wavenumbers $45< k<\n10^4\\, Mpc^{-1}$.

The cavities of\npowerful outbursts are not larger (or smaller) at higher redshift, and are not\nable to rise to further (or lesser) distances from the nucleus. The energetics\nof these outbursts also remain the same. This suggests that extreme \"radio\nmode\" feedback (L_(mech) > 10^44 erg/s) starts to operate as early as 7 - 8\nGyrs after the Big Bang and shows no sign of evolution since then. In other\nwords, AGNs lying at the centre of clusters are able to operate at early times\nwith extreme mechanical powers, and have been operating in such a way for at\nleast the past 5 Gyrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 20:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 01:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The formalism is based on the partitioning of a system's environment\ninto \"core\" and \"reservoir\" modes, with the former to be treated quantum\nmechanically and the latter classically. The presented method only requires the\ncalculation of the system's reduced density matrix averaged over the quantum\ncore degrees of freedom which is then coupled to a classically evolved\nreservoir to treat the remaining modes. We demonstrate our approach by applying\nit to the spin-boson problem using the noninteracting blip approximation to\ntreat the system and core, and Ehrenfest dynamics to treat the reservoir. The\nresulting hybrid methodology is accurate for both fast and slow baths, since it\nnaturally reduces to its composite methods in their respective regimes of\nvalidity.

The symmetry is\nrooted in the mathematical properties of trees, p-adic numbers, and ultrametric\nspaces; and in the physical property of detailed balance. We provide\nself-contained elementary explanations of the unfamiliar mathematical concepts,\nwhich have have also appeared in the study of the p-adic string.\n  The symmetry acts on a huge collection of very low dimensional \"multiverse\nfields\" that are not associated with the usual perturbative degrees of freedom.\nThey are connected with the late-time statistical distribution of\nbubble-universes in the multiverse.\n  The conformal symmetry which acts on the multiverse fields is broken by the\nexistence of terminal decays - to hats or crunches - but in a particularly\nsimple way.

This unique system\ncannot be reconciled with current observations where milli-second pulsars are\ngenerally seen to orbit white dwarfs in almost exactly circular orbits. Current\ntheoretical models of binary and stellar formation and evolution cannot explain\nthe high eccentricity of this system either. In this work, we present three new\nepochs of optical spectroscopy for the companion to PSR J1903+0327, obtained to\nconfirm the association of the main-sequence star with the pulsar. These 3 new\nepochs together with the 2 previous ones obtained by Freire et al. (2011)\nfirmly establish the high eccentricity of the companion's orbit as predicted by\npulsar timing. Using all five epochs of optical data, we have provided an\nindependent estimate of the mass-ratio, R=1.56\\pm0.15 as well as the systemic\nradial velocity of the binary, \\gamma= 42.1\\pm2.5 km/s. We constrain the\nspectral type of the pulsar companion to lie between F5 V -- G0 V (a slightly\nearlier type than suggested previously) by measuring the equivalent widths of\ntwo of the three Ca-triplet lines (8498 \\AA, 8542 \\AA) and the Paschen line at\n8598 \\AA (P14); we also broadly constrain the metallicity of the companion.\nAdditionally, we have placed a somewhat better limit on the rotational velocity\nof the pulsar companion of v_{rot}\\sin{i} \\leq 66 km/s which is still not\nsufficient to allow a test of general relativity using this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 21:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Using extensive\ncomputer simulations, we show that a novel second-order-like transition, the\ncontact percolation transition, which signals the formation of a\nsystem-spanning cluster of mutually contacting particles, occurs at $\\phi_P <\n\\phi_J$, preceding the jamming transition. By measuring the number of\nnon-floppy modes of the dynamical matrix, and the displacement field and\ntime-dependent pressure following compression, we find that the contact\npercolation transition also heralds the onset of complex spatiotemporal\nresponse to applied stress. Thus, highly heterogeneous, cooperative, and\nnon-affine particle motion occurs in unjammed systems significantly below the\njamming transition for $\\phi_P < \\phi < \\phi_J$, not only for jammed systems\nwith $\\phi > \\phi_J$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 21:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

The framework is suitable for low signal-to-noise ratio events\nthrough the construction of multiple subtests, most of which involve only a\nlimited number of coefficients. It also naturally allows for the combination of\ninformation from multiple sources to increase one's confidence in GR or a\nviolation thereof.

In comparison,\ntemperatures measured from the general IGM at z~5 are ~0.3 dex cooler, implying\nan additional source of heating around these quasars which is not yet present\nin the general IGM at slightly lower redshift. This heating is most likely due\nto the recent reionisation of He-II in vicinity of these quasars, which have\nhard, non-thermal ionising spectra. The elevated temperatures may therefore\nrepresent evidence for the earliest stages of He-II reionisation in the most\nbiased regions of the high-redshift Universe. The temperature as a function of\ndistance from the quasars is consistent with being constant, log(T_0/K)~4.2,\nwith no evidence for a line-of-sight thermal proximity effect.

Here\nthe effect of the Fermi statistics becomes completely irrelevant due to the no\ndouble occupancy constraint. Upon doping, the statistical signs reemerge,\nalbeit much reduced as compared to the original Fermi statistical signs. By\nprecisely incorporating this altered statistical sign structure at finite\ndoping, the LDA ground state can be recast into a short-range antiferromagnetic\nstate.

Contrary to what\nthe name may suggest, NBL is not a random/fuzzy logic system. In fact, it is a\ncompletely deterministic logic system. A key property of NBL is that it allows\nus to apply a superposition of many input vectors to a SAT instance at the same\ntime, circumventing a key restriction and assumption in the traditional\napproach to solving SAT. By exploiting the superposition property of NBL, our\nNBL-based SAT algorithm can determine whether an instance is SAT or not in a\nsingle operation. A satisfying solution can be found by iteratively performing\nSAT check operations up to n times, where n is the number of variables in the\nSAT instance. Although this paper does not focus on the realization of an\nNBL-based SAT engine, such an engine can be conceived using analog circuits\n(wide-band amplifiers, adders and multipliers), FPGAs or ASICs. Additionally,\nwe also discus scalability of our approach, which can apply to NBL in general.\nThe NBL-based SAT engine described in this paper has been simulated in software\nfor validation purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 00:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-05"}

This discovery suggests that electron-positron pairs in the nebula are\naccelerated to PeV energies in a milliGauss magnetic field, which is difficult\nto explain with classical models of particle acceleration and pulsar wind\nnebulae. We investigate whether particle acceleration in a magnetic\nreconnection layer can account for the puzzling properties of the flares. We\nnumerically integrate relativistic test-particle orbits in the vicinity of the\nlayer, including the radiation reaction force, and using analytical expressions\nfor the large-scale electromagnetic fields. As they get accelerated by the\nreconnection electric field, the particles are focused deep inside the current\nlayer where the magnetic field is small. The electrons suffer less from\nsynchrotron losses and are accelerated to extremely high energies. Population\nstudies show that, at the end of the layer, the particle distribution piles up\nat the maximum energy given by the electric potential drop and is focused into\na thin fan beam. Applying this model to the Crab Nebula, we find that the\nemerging synchrotron emission spectrum peaks above 100 MeV and is close to the\nspectral shape of a single electron. The flare inverse Compton emission is\nnegligible and no detectable emission is expected at other wavelengths. This\nmechanism provides a plausible explanation for the gamma-ray flares in the Crab\nNebula and could be at work in other astrophysical objects such as relativistic\njets in active galactic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 01:18:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 16:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Normal star formation took place only after the first stars\npolluted the surrounding turbulent interstellar gas, increasing its local heavy\nelement concentration, Z, beyond a critical value, Z_c (10^-8 < Z_c <10^-5).\nMotivated by this astrophysical problem, we investigate the fundamental physics\nof the pollution of pristine fluid elements in isotropic compressible\nturbulence. Turbulence stretches the pollutants, produces concentration\nstructures at small scales, and brings the pollutants and the unpolluted flow\nin closer contact. Our theoretical approach employs the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) method for turbulent mixing. We adopt three PDF\nclosure models and derive evolution equations for the pristine fraction from\nthe models. To test and constrain the theoretical models, we conduct numerical\nsimulations for decaying passive scalars in isothermal turbulent flows with\nMach numbers of 0.9 and 6.2, and compute the mass fraction, P(Z_c, t), of the\nflow with Z < Z_c. In the Mach 0.9 flow, the evolution of P(Z_c, t)$ is well\ndescribed by a continuous convolution model and dP(Z_c, t)/dt = P(Z_c, t)\nln[P(Z_c, t)]/tau_con, if the mass fraction of the polluted flow is larger than\n~ 0.1. If the initial pollutant fraction is smaller than ~ 0.1, an early phase\nexists during which the pristine fraction follows an equation from a nonlinear\nintegral model: dP(Z_c, t)/dt = P(Z_c, t) [P(Z_c, t)-1]/tau_int. The timescales\ntau_con and tau_int are measured from our simulations. When normalized to the\nflow dynamical time, the decay of P(Z_ c, t) in the Mach 6.2 flow is slower\nthan at Mach 0.9, and we show that P(Z_c, t) in the Mach 6.2 flow can be well\nfit using a formula from a generalized version of the self-convolution model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 03:59:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 06:26:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 22:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

In some situations, however, one may wish to\npurposely decrease discriminability of one classification task (a \"distractor\"\ntask), while simultaneously preserving information relevant to another (the\ntask-of-interest): For example, it may be important to mask the identity of\npersons contained in face images before submitting them to a crowdsourcing site\n(e.g., Mechanical Turk) when labeling them for certain facial attributes.\nAnother example is inter-dataset generalization: when training on a dataset\nwith a particular covariance structure among multiple attributes, it may be\nuseful to suppress one attribute while preserving another so that a trained\nclassifier does not learn spurious correlations between attributes. In this\npaper we present an algorithm that finds optimal filters to give high\ndiscriminability to one task while simultaneously giving low discriminability\nto a distractor task. We present results showing the effectiveness of the\nproposed technique on both simulated data and natural face images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 06:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-05"}

This associated\nsystem is called a Lax pair. Two equivalent representations are presented. The\nfirst uses a pair of differential operators which leads to a higher order\nlinear system for the auxiliary function. The second uses a pair of matrices\nwhich leads to a first-order linear system. In this paper we present a method,\nwhich is easily implemented in Maple or Mathematica, to compute an operator Lax\npair for a set of PDEs.\n  In the operator representation, the determining equations for the Lax pair\nsplit into a set of kinematic constraints which are independent of the original\nequation and a set of dynamical equations which do depend on it. The kinematic\nconstraints can be solved generically. We assume that the operators have a\nscaling symmetry. The dynamical equations are then reduced to a set of\nnonlinear algebraic equations.\n  This approach is illustrated with well-known examples from soliton theory. In\nparticular, it is applied to a three parameter class of fifth-order KdV-like\nevolution equations which includes the Lax fifth-order KdV, Sawada-Kotera and\nKaup-Kuperschmidt equations. A second Lax pair was found for the Sawada--Kotera\nequation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 06:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-05"}

The main\nmessage of the paper is that von Neumann's argument described in his letter to\nUlam is the very first proof that spatial isomorphism and spectral isomorphism\nare not equivalent because spectral isomorphism is weaker than spatial\nisomorphism: von Neumann shows that spectrally isomorphic ergodic dynamical\nsystems with mixed spectra need not be spatially isomorphic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 10:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-05"}

The photometric redshifts of KIEROs are between 1.5 and 5,\nwith ~70% at z~2-4. KIEROs are very massive, with M*~10^10-10^12 Msun. They are\noptically faint and usually cannot be picked out by the Lyman break selection.\nOn the other hand, the KIERO selection includes approximately half of the known\nmillimeter and submillimeter galaxies in the GOODS-N. Stacking analyses in the\nradio, millimeter, and submillimeter all show that KIEROs are much more\nluminous than average 4.5um selected galaxies. Interestingly, the stacked\nfluxes for ACS-undetected KIEROs in these wavebands are 2.5-5 times larger than\nthose for ACS-detected KIEROs. With the stacked radio fluxes and the local\nradio-FIR correlation, we derive mean infrared luminosities of 2-7x10^12 Lsun\nand mean star formation rates of 300-1200 Msun/yr for KIEROs with redshifts. We\ndo not find evidence of a significant subpopulation of passive KIEROs. The\nlarge stellar masses and star formation rates imply that KIEROs are $z>2$\nmassive galaxies in rapid formation. Our results show that a large sample of\ndusty ultraluminous sources can be selected in this way and that a large\nfraction of high-redshift star formation is hidden by dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 14:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 06:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Applications require high critical\ncurrent densities, so the usefulness of any new superconductor is determined\nboth by the capability to develop strong vortex pinning and by the absence or\nability to overcome any strong current-limiting mechanisms of which grain\nboundaries in the cuprates are a cautionary example.

Initial experiments with the textured\nsubstrates used for cuprate coated conductors show similar benefit for the\ncritical current density of FBS thin films too.

We\nfocus on the ICME propagation in IP space that is governed by two forces, the\npropelling Lorentz force and the drag force. We address the question at which\nheliospheric distance range the drag becomes dominant and the CME gets adjusted\nto the solar wind flow. To this aim we analyze speed differences between ICMEs\nand the ambient solar wind flow as function of distance. The evolution of the\nambient solar wind flow is derived from ENLIL 3D MHD model runs using different\nsolar wind models, namely Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) and MHD-Around-A-Sphere\n(MAS). Comparing the measured CME kinematics with the solar wind models we find\nthat the CME speed gets adjusted to the solar wind speed at very different\nheliospheric distances in the three events under study: from below 30 Rs, to\nbeyond 1 AU, depending on the CME and ambient solar wind characteristics. ENLIL\ncan be used to derive important information about the overall structure of the\nbackground solar wind, providing more reliable results during times of low\nsolar activity than during times of high solar activity. The results from this\nstudy enable us to get a better insight into the forces acting on CMEs over the\nIP space distance range, which is an important prerequisite in order to predict\ntheir 1 AU transit times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 07:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
