Specifically, in the\nfirst stage of the model, we isolate underlying patterns in pollution\nconcentrations due to global factors such as underlying climate and topography,\nwhich are modelled together with spatial structure. At this stage measurements\nfrom monitoring sites located within rural areas are used which, as far as\npossible, are chosen to reflect background concentrations. Having isolated\nthese global effects, in the second stage we assess the effects of human\nactivity on pollution in urban areas.

However, some\nobservations indicate that the dust production by SNe is an inefficient\nprocess, casting doubts on the existence of abundant SNe-dust in the early\nuniverse. Recently, Perley et al. (2010) reported that the afterglow of GRB\n071025 - an unusually red GRB at z ~ 5 - shows evidence for the SNe-produced\ndust. Since this is perhaps the only high redshift GRB exhibiting compelling\nevidence for SNe-dust but the result could easily be affected by small\nsystematics in photometry, we re-examined the extinction properties of GRB\n071025 using our own optical/near-infrared data at a different epoch. In\naddition, we tested SNe-dust models with different progenitor masses and dust\ndestruction efficiencies to constrain the dust formation mechanisms. By\nsearching for the best-fit model of the afterglow spectral energy distribution,\nwe confirm the previous claim that the dust in GRB 071025 is most likely to\noriginate from SNe.

However, our calculations suggest it is not substantially\naffected by either of the destabilising mechanisms proposed in previous\ntheoretical models. Instead the instability is destabilised by interactions\nwith magnetic drifts, and the electrostatic potential. Further calculations\nreveal that the mode is not significantly destabilised by the flux surface\nshaping or the large trapped particle fraction present in the spherical\ntokamak. Its prevalence in spherical tokamak plasmas is primarily due to the\nhigher value of plasma {\\beta}, and the enhanced magnetic drifts due to the\nsmaller radius of curvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 17:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-15"}

Star-forming galaxies must be accreting from their coronae. HI\nobservations of external galaxies show that they have HI halos associated with\nstar formation. These halos are naturally modelled as ensembles of clouds\ndriven up by supernova bubbles. These models can fit the data successfully only\nif clouds exchange mass and momentum with the corona. As a cloud orbits, it is\nablated and forms a turbulent wake where cold high-metallicity gas mixes with\nhot coronal gas causing the prompt cooling of the latter. As a consequence the\ntotal mass of HI increases. This model has recently been used to model the\nLeiden-Argentina-Bonn survey of Galactic HI. The values of the model's\nparameters that are required to model NGC 891, NGC 2403 and our Galaxy show a\nremarkable degree of consistency, despite the very different natures of the two\nexternal galaxies and the dramatic difference in the nature of the data for our\nGalaxy and the external galaxies. The parameter values are also consistent with\nhydrodynamical simulations of the ablation of individual clouds. The model\npredicts that a galaxy that loses its cool-gas disc for instance through a\nmajor merger cannot reform it from its corona; it can return to steady star\nformation only if it can capture a large body of cool gas, for example by\naccreting a gas-rich dwarf. Thus the model explains how major mergers can make\ngalaxies \"red and dead.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 17:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This\nproblem of classification is most severe for HII regions in an early\nevolutionary stage, those that are extremely distant, or those that are both\nyoung and distant. Using data from the Herschel Hi-GAL survey, as well as WISE\nand the Spitzer MIPSGAL and GLIMPSE surveys, we wish to establish\ncharacteristic IR colors that can be used to distinguish between HII regions\nand PNe. We perform aperture photometry measurements for a sample of 126 HII\nregions and 43 PNe at wavelengths from 8.0 micron to 500 micron. We find that\nHII regions and PNe have distinct IR colors. The most robust discriminating\ncolor criteria are [F12/F8] < 0.3, [F160/F12] > 1.3, and [F160/F24] > 0.8 (or\nalternately [F160/F22] > 0.8), where the brackets indicate the log of the flux\nratio. All three of these criteria are individually satisfied by over 98% of\nour sample of HII regions and by about 10% of our sample of PNe. Combinations\nof these colors are more robust in separating the two populations; for example\nall HII regions and no PNe satisfy [F12/F8] < 0.4 and [F160/F22] > 0.8. When\napplied to objects of unknown classification, these criteria prove useful in\nseparating the two populations. The dispersion in color is relatively small for\nHII regions; this suggests that any evolution in these colors with time for HII\nregions must be relatively modest. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of\nHII regions can be separated into \"warm\" and \"cold\" components. The \"cold\"\ncomponent is well-fit by a grey-body of temperature 25K. The SEDs of nearly\ntwo-thirds of our sample of HII regions peak at 160 micron and one third peak\nat 70 micron.

Within CES bio-inspired systems play a key role. The disclosure\nfrom bio-inspired systems and biological computation has not been sufficiently\nworked out, however. Biological computation is to be taken as the processing of\ninformation by living systems that is carried out in polynomial time, i.e.,\nefficiently; such processing however is grasped by current science and research\nas an intractable problem (for instance, the protein folding problem). A remark\nis needed here: P versus NP problems should be well defined and delimited but\nbiological computation problems are not. The shift from conventional\nengineering to bio-inspired engineering needs bring the subject (or problem) of\ncomputability to a new level. Within the frame of computation, so far, the\nprevailing paradigm is still the Turing-Church thesis. In other words,\nconventional engineering is still ruled by the Church-Turing thesis (CTt).\nHowever, CES is ruled by CTt, too. Contrarily to the above, we shall argue here\nthat biological computation demands a more careful thinking that leads us\ntowards hypercomputation. Bio-inspired engineering and CES thereafter, must\nturn its regard toward biological computation. Thus, biological computation can\nand should be taken as the ground for engineering complex non-linear systems.\nBiological systems do compute in terms of hypercomputation, indeed. If so, then\nthe focus is not algorithmic or computational complexity but\ncomputation-beyond-the-Church-Turing-barrier.

Electronic health record (EHR) data promise to\nsupport the development and testing of mechanistic physiologic models on\ndiverse population, but limitations in the data have thus far thwarted such\nuse. For instance, using uncontrolled population-scale EHR data to verify the\noutcome of time dependent behavior of mechanistic, constructive models can be\ndifficult because: (i) aggregation of the population can obscure or generate a\nsignal, (ii) there is often no control population, and (iii) diversity in how\nthe population is measured can make the data difficult to fit into conventional\nanalysis techniques. This paper shows that it is possible to use EHR data to\ntest a physiological model for a population and over long time scales.\nSpecifically, a methodology is developed and demonstrated for testing a\nmechanistic, time-dependent, physiological model of serum glucose dynamics with\nuncontrolled, population-scale, physiological patient data extracted from an\nEHR repository. It is shown that there is no observable daily variation the\nnormalized mean glucose for any EHR subpopulations. In contrast, a derived\nvalue, daily variation in nonlinear correlation quantified by the time-delayed\nmutual information (TDMI), did reveal the intuitively expected diurnal\nvariation in glucose levels amongst a wild population of humans. Moreover, in a\npopulation of intravenously fed patients, there was no observable TDMI-based\ndiurnal signal. These TDMI-based signals, via a glucose insulin model, were\nthen connected with human feeding patterns. In particular, a constructive\nphysiological model was shown to correctly predict the difference between the\ngeneral uncontrolled population and a subpopulation whose feeding was\ncontrolled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 17:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We review how these couplings affect the cosmological\nperturbations via a unified study based on the in-in formalism. We then note\nthat, when the inflaton coupling to gauge fields is high enough to lead to\ninteresting observational results, the backreaction of the produced gauge\nquanta on the inflaton dynamics becomes relevant during the final stage of\ninflation, and prolongs its duration by about 10 e-foldings.

We report the gain in\nPMT response at a concentration of 1 ppm as: 1.88 $\\pm$ 0.02 for\n4-Methylumbelliferone, stable to within 0.5% over 50 days, 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.03 for\nCarbostyril-124, and 1.20 $\\pm$ 0.02 for Amino-G Salt. The response of\n4-Methylumbelliferone was modeled, resulting in a simulated gain within 9% of\nthe experimental gain at 1 ppm concentration. Finally, we report an increase in\nneutron detection performance of a large-scale (3.5 kL) gadolinium-doped water\nCherenkov detector at a 4-Methylumbelliferone concentration of 1 ppm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 20:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

However, this picture ignores the essential role\nof the air that is trapped between the impacting drop and the surface. Here we\ndescribe a new imaging modality that is sensitive to the behavior right at the\nsurface. We show that a very thin film of air, only a few tens of nanometers\nthick, remains trapped between the falling drop and the surface as the drop\nspreads. The thin film of air serves to lubricate the drop enabling the fluid\nto skate on the air film laterally outward at surprisingly high velocities,\nconsistent with theoretical predictions. Eventually this thin film of air must\nbreak down as the fluid wets the surface. We suggest that this occurs in a\nspinodal-like fashion, and causes a very rapid spreading of a wetting front\noutwards; simultaneously the wetting fluid spreads inward much more slowly,\ntrapping a bubble of air within the drop.

Very efficient mixing is obtained when N is large, corresponding to a\nlarge number of length scales in the flow fields.

In atomic physics the lengths are\nthe Compton wavelength of the electron and the Bohr radius; the ratio of these\ntwo lengths is the fine structure constant, $\\alpha=7.30\\times10^{-3}$. In\ncosmology we take the lengths to be the Planck length and the de Sitter radius\ndivided by $\\sqrt 3$; the ratio of these two lengths is about\n$\\alpha_g=1.91\\times10^{-61}$, which we suggest should be called the\ngravitational fine structure constant. There is also a basic energy ratio in\natomic physics, the ratio of the hydrogen atom binding energy to the electron\nrest energy, which is equal to ${\\alpha^2}/2$. The analogous energy ratio in\ncosmology is the ratio of the dark energy density (described in terms of the\ncosmological constant) to the Planck energy density, which is equal to\n$(1/8\\pi)\\alpha_g^2$. The long-standing problem of the nature of the dark\nenergy and its small density is obviously equivalent to understanding the\nextraordinarily small value of $\\alpha_g$.

Special cases of this problem are well known:\nK=N is the suffix sorting problem that is the workhorse in Stringology with\nhundreds of applications, and K=1 is the recently studied suffix selection.\n  We show that suffix multi-selection can be solved in Theta(N log N -\nsum_{j=0}^K Delta_j log Delta_j+N) time and comparisons, where r_0=0,\nr_{K+1}=N+1, and Delta_j=r_{j+1}-r_j for 0<=j<=K. This is asymptotically\noptimal, and also matches the bound in [Dobkin, Munro, JACM 28(3)] for\nmulti-selection on atomic elements (not suffixes).

(2007) linked the catastrophic formation of Baptistina Asteroid\nFamily (BAF) to the K/T impact event. This linkage was based on dynamical and\ncompositional evidence, which suggested the impactor had a composition similar\nto CM2 carbonaceous chondrites. However, our recent study (Reddy et al. 2009)\nsuggests that the composition of (298) Baptistina is similar to LL-type\nordinary chondrites rather than CM2 carbonaceous chondrites. This rules out any\npossibility of it being related to the source of the K/T impactor, if the\nimpactor was of CM-type composition. Mineralogical study of asteroids in the\nvicinity of BAF has revealed a plethora of compositional types suggesting a\ncomplex formation and evolution environment. A detailed compositional analysis\nof 16 asteroids suggests several distinct surface assemblages including\nordinary chondrites (Gaffey SIV subtype), primitive achondrites (Gaffey SIII\nsubtype), basaltic achondrites (Gaffey SVII subtype and V-type), and a\ncarbonaceous chondrite. Based on our mineralogical analysis we conclude that\n(298) Baptistina is similar to ordinary chondrites (LL-type) based on olivine\nand pyroxene mineralogy and moderate albedo. S-type and V-type in and around\nthe vicinity of BAF we characterized show mineralogical affinity to (8) Flora\nand (4) Vesta and could be part of their families. Smaller BAF asteroids with\nlower SNR spectra showing only a 'single' band are compositionally similar to\n(298) Baptistina and L/LL chondrites. It is unclear at this point why the\nsilicate absorption bands in spectra of asteroids with formal family definition\nseem suppressed relative to background population, despite having similar\nmineralogy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2011 13:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}

The three balls\nhave rebound coefficients of 0.9, 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. However, we notice\nthat the Waboba bounces better than the others, but why? The Superball has a\nhigh coefficient of restitution, creating large rebounds. Here the impact is\nangled to the free surface, but the inelastic response and large mass ratio\nforces the ball underwater without skipping. The racquetball has a lower mass\nratio and a more elastic response to impacts. Also thrown at a shallow angle,\nit bounces off of the surface of the water 1-3 times before coming to rest. The\nWaboba flattens inside the cavity allowing it to skip off of the surface more\neasily. The flattened ball looks more like a skipping stone than a sphere due\nto its large elastic deformation at impact. Examining the reaction of a\nskipping stone we see that the stone creates a cavity in which it planes,\nslipping out of it with some upward velocity. The Waboba behaves like a\nskipping stone planing on the surface of the water, allowing it to bounce\nupwards of 20 times and traveling nearly 60 meters. While some skill is needed\nto throw the Waboba across a pond, It adapts to each skip because of its\nelastic response, whereas the stone must be thrown perfectly in order to gain\nthe best skipping advantage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 23:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

A pulsatile jet of air is formed downstream of the\nvibrating folds which interacts with the various structures in the airway.\nCurrently, it is postulated that the way this jet interacts with the downstream\nstructures in the airway directly affects the quality of human speech. In order\nto better understand this jet, it is desirable to visualize the jet in three\ndimensions. We present the results of a method that reconstructs the three\ndimensional velocity field using Synthetic aperture PIV (SAPIV)\n\\cite{Belden:2010}.\n  SAPIV uses an array of high-speed cameras to artificially create a single\ncamera with a variable focal length. This is accomplished by overlapping the\nimages from the array to create a \"focal stack\". As the images are increasingly\noverlapped, more distant image planes come into focus. 3D PIV is then performed\non the \"refocused\" focal stack to reconstruct the flow field in three\ndimensions. SAPIV has the ability to track very high particle densities.\n  Artificial self oscillating vocal folds made of silicone were driven with\ncompressed air infused with small glass microspheres. As the vocal folds\nvibrated, the entrained microspheres were illuminated by a laser volume. Eight\nhigh-speed cameras were used to capture images of the particles for SAPIV\npostprocessing.\n  SAPIV was able to successfully perform the first whole-field reconstruction\nof the pulsatile jet emerging from the vocal folds. The ability to visualize\nthis jet will help researchers and clinicians better understand the physics of\nspeech production as well as improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment\nof voice disorders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 22:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}
