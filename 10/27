The regions include three almost-complete 1.4 sqdeg\ntiles located 3.5 deg away from the LMC centre in distinct directions. To this\ndataset, we add two 0.036 sqdeg subregions inside the 30 Doradus tile. The SFH\nis derived from the simultaneous reconstruction of two different CMDs, using\nthe minimization code StarFISH. The distance modulus (m-M)_0 and extinction Av\nis varied within intervals 0.2 and 0.5 mag wide, respectively, within which we\nidentify the best-fitting star formation rate SFR(t), age-metallicity relation\n(AMR), (m-M)_0 and Av. Our results demonstrate that VMC data, due to the\ncombination of depth and little sensitivity to differential reddening, allow\nthe derivation of the space-resolved SFH of the LMC with unprecedented quality\ncompared to previous wide-area surveys. In particular, the data clearly reveal\nthe presence of peaks in the SFR(t) at ages log(t/yr)=9.3 and 9.7, which appear\nin most of the subregions. The most recent SFR is found to vary greatly from\nsubregion to subregion, with the general trend of being more intense in the\ninnermost LMC, except for the tile next to the N11 complex. In the bar region,\nthe SFR seems remarkably constant over the time interval from 8.4 to 9.7. The\nAMRs, instead, turn out to be remarkably similar across the LMC.

This universality stems from a drastic\ndecrease of coherence between the sparsity and the sensing bases, which for a\nFourier sensing basis relates to a spread of the original signal spectrum by\nthe modulation (hence the name \"spread spectrum\").

From\nmid-1990s onwards it was revealed that dwarf spheroidals often display a varied\nand in some cases complex star formation history. In an optical survey of\nbright nearby galaxies, NGC 185 was classified as a Seyfert galaxy based on its\nemission line ratios.

NGC 185 was not detected in radio\nsurveys either in 6 or 20 cm, or X-ray observations, which means that the\nSeyfert-like line ratios may be produced by stellar processes. In this work, we\ntry to identify the possible ionization mechanisms for this galaxy. We\ndiscussed the possibility of the line emissions being produced by planetary\nnebulae (PNe), using deep spectroscopy observations obtained with GMOS-N, at\nGemini. Although the fluxes of the PNe are high enough to explain the\nintegrated spectrum, the line ratios are very far from the values for the\nSeyfert classification. We then proposed that a mixture of supernova remnants\nand PNe could be the source of the ionization, and we show that a composition\nof these two objects do mimic Seyfert-like line ratios. We used chemical\nevolution models to predict the supernova rates and to support the idea that\nthese supernova remnants should be present in the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 19:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Before and since the\nfirst magnetic maps of an accreting T Tauri star were published in 2007 a new\ngeneration of magnetospheric accretion models have been developed that\nincorporate multipole magnetic fields. Three-dimensional models of the\nlarge-scale stellar magnetosphere with an observed degree of complexity have\nbeen produced via numerical field extrapolation from observationally derived T\nTauri magnetic maps. Likewise, analytic and magnetohydrodynamic models with\nmultipolar stellar magnetic fields have been produced.

We illustrate that a flavor-clean beta beam best\nsuits the requirements of such a detector, in particular, that PINGU may\nreplace a magic baseline detector for small values of theta_13 -- even in the\nabsence of any energy resolution capability. For large theta_13, however, a\nsingle-baseline beta beam experiment cannot compete if it is constrained by the\nCERN-SPS. For a neutrino factory, because of the missing charge identification\npossibility in the detector, a very good energy resolution is required. If this\ncan be achieved, especially a low energy neutrino factory, which does not\nsuffer from the tau contamination, may be an interesting option for large\ntheta_13. For the superbeam, where we use the LBNE beam as a reference,\nelectron neutrino flavor identification and statistics are two of the main\nlimitations. Finally, we demonstrate that, at least in principle, neutrino\nfactory and superbeam can measure the density of the Earth's core to the\nsub-percent level for sin^2 2theta_13 larger than 0.01.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 12:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The sample consists of mostly old\nthin and thick disk stars, with a minimal contribution from the stellar halo,\nin the region 6 < R < 16 kpc, 0.15 < |Z| < 1.5 kpc. The data reveal that the\nradial metallicity gradient becomes flat at heights |Z| > 1 kpc. The median\nmetallicity at large |Z| is consistent with the metallicities seen in outer\ndisk open clusters, which exhibit a flat radial gradient at [Fe/H] ~ -0.5. We\nnote that the outer disk clusters are also located at large |Z|; because the\nflat gradient extends to small R for our sample, there is some ambiguity in\nwhether the observed trends for clusters are due to a change in R or |Z|. We\ntherefore stress the importance of considering both the radial and vertical\ndirections when measuring spatial abundance trends in the disk. The flattening\nof the gradient at high |Z| also has implications on thick disk formation\nscenarios, which predict different metallicity patterns in the thick disk. A\nflat gradient, such as we observe, is predicted by a turbulent disk at high\nredshift, but may also be consistent with radial migration, as long as mixing\nis strong.

It is now known that at least some NSCs coexist\nwith supermassive black holes (SBHs); this is the case, for instance, in the\nMilky Way (MW). In this paper, we investigate how the presence of a SMBH at the\ncenter of the MW impacts the merger hypothesis for the formation of its NSC.\nStarting from a model consisting of a low-density nuclear stellar disk and the\nSMBH, we use N-body simulations to follow the successive inspiral and merger of\nglobular clusters. The clusters are started on circular orbits of radius 20 pc,\nand their initial masses and radii are set up in such a way as to be consistent\nwith the galactic tidal field at that radius. The total accumulated mass by ~10\nclusters is about 1.5x10^7 Solar masses. Each cluster is disrupted by the SMBH\nat a distance of roughly one parsec. The density profile that results after the\nfinal inspiral event is characterized by a core of roughly this radius, and an\nenvelope with density that falls off as 1/r^2. These properties are similar to\nthose of the MW NSC, with the exception of the core size, which in the MW is a\nlittle smaller. But by continuing the evolution of the model after the final\ninspiral event, we find that the core shrinks substantially via gravitational\nencounters in a time (when scaled to the MW) of 10 Gyr as the stellar\ndistribution evolves toward a Bahcall-Wolf cusp. We also show that the\nluminosity function of the MW NSC is consistent with the hypothesis that a\nlarge fraction of the mass comes from (~10Gyr) old stars, brought in by\nglobular clusters. We conclude that a model in which a large fraction of the\nmass of the MW NSC arose from infalling globular clusters is consistent with\nexisting observational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 22:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 19:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Thus, for\ninstance, increasing the time efficiency of MRI often comes at the expense of\nreduced SNR. This, in turn, necessitates the use of post-processing tools for\nnoise rejection, which makes image de-noising an indispensable component of\ncomputer assistance diagnosis. In the field of MRI, a multitude of image\nde-noising methods have been proposed hitherto. In this paper, the application\nof a particular class of de-noising algorithms - known as non-local mean (NLM)\nfilters - is investigated. Such filters have been recently applied for MRI data\nenhancement and they have been shown to provide more accurate results as\ncompared to many alternative de-noising algorithms. Unfortunately, virtually\nall existing methods for NLM filtering have been derived under the assumption\nof additive white Gaussian (AWG) noise contamination. Since this assumption is\nknown to fail at low values of SNR, an alternative formulation of NLM filtering\nis required, which would take into consideration the correct Rician statistics\nof MRI noise. Accordingly, the contribution of the present paper is two-fold.\nFirst, it points out some principal disadvantages of the earlier methods of NLM\nfiltering of MRI images and suggests means to rectify them. Second, the paper\nintroduces a new similarity measure for NLM filtering of MRI Images, which is\nderived under bona fide statistical assumptions and results in more accurate\nreconstruction of MR scans as compared to alternative NLM approaches. Finally,\nthe utility and viability of the proposed method is demonstrated through a\nseries of numerical experiments using both in silico and in vivo MRI data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 23:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-28"}

Previous measurements of\nthe H-alpha emission-line kinematics have determined that the dark matter halo\nof NGC 2976 is most consistent with a cored density profile. We find that the\nstellar kinematics are best fit with a cuspy halo. Cored dark matter halo fits\nare only consistent with the stellar kinematics if the stellar mass-to-light\nratio is significantly larger than that derived from stellar population\nsynthesis, while the best-fitting cuspy model has no such conflict. The\ninferred mass distribution from a harmonic decomposition of the gaseous\nkinematics is inconsistent with that of the stellar kinematics. This difference\nis likely due to the gas disk not meeting the assumptions that underlie the\nanalysis such as no pressure support, a constant kinematic axis, and planar\norbits. By relaxing some of these assumptions, in particular the form of the\nkinematic axis with radius, the gas-derived solution can be made consistent\nwith the stellar kinematic models. A strong kinematic twist in the gas of NGC\n2976's center suggests caution, and we advance the mass model based on the\nstellar kinematics as more reliable.

In this paper, key predictions of DSA at relativistic\nshocks that are germane to production of relativistic electrons and ions are\noutlined. The technique employed to identify these characteristics is a Monte\nCarlo simulation of such diffusive acceleration in test-particle, relativistic,\noblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks. Using a compact prescription for\ndiffusion of charges in MHD turbulence, this approach generates particle\nangular and momentum distributions at any position upstream or downstream of\nthe shock. Simulation output is presented for both small angle and large angle\nscattering scenarios, and a variety of shock obliquities including superluminal\nregimes when the de Hoffmann-Teller frame does not exist.

While\ntargeting the active site is a straightforward strategy of enzyme inhibition,\nevidences of allosteric modulation of active site in many enzymes underscore\nthe molecular origin of signal transduction. Information of co-evolving\nsequences in SAHH family and the key residues for functional dynamics that can\nbe identified using native topology of the enzyme provide glimpses into how the\nallosteric signaling network, dispersed over the molecular structure,\ncoordinates intra- and inter-subunit conformational dynamics. To study the link\nbetween the allosteric communication and functional dynamics of SAHHs, we\nperformed Brownian dynamics simulations by building a coarse-grained model\nbased on the holo and ligand-bound structures.

Analyses of the unabsorbed spectra imply that the intrinsic TeV\nemission of some blazars is hard, with spectral indices 0.5 < alpha < 1. The\nabsorption depends on the level of extragalactic background light (EBL) that is\ndifficult to measure directly. This implies that it is difficult to estimate\nthe slope of the intrinsic TeV emission. To test our blazar emission scenario\nthat is capable to reproducing the hard spectra, we therefore used the\nobservations made by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in the unabsorbed\nMeV-GeV energy range. We assume that the X-ray and gamma-ray emission of TeV\nblazars is produced in a compact region of a jet uniformly filled by particles\nof relatively high energy (g >~ 10^3, E=g m_e c^2). In other words, we assume a\nlow energy cut-off in the particle energy distribution. The emission produced\nby the particles with this energy spectrum can explain hard intrinsic spectra\nin the energy range from MeV up to TeV. We demonstrate how to estimate the\nbasic physical parameters of a source in this case and how to explain the\nobserved spectra by a precise simulation of the particle energy evolution.

The circumstellar environment of evolved stars is generally rich in\nmolecular gas and dust.

The stars were taken from a larger sample of\npost-AGB binaries for which we have Spitzer infrared spectra, characterised by\nthe presence of a stable oxygen-rich circumbinary disc. Our previous studies\nhave shown that the infrared spectra of post-AGB disc sources are dominated by\nsilicate dust emission, often with an extremely high crystallinity fraction.\nHowever, the three sources described here are selected because they show a\npeculiar molecular chemistry.

Here we give a general frame work of the\nexisting tunneling mechanism, both the radial null geodesic and Hamilton Jacobi\nmethods. On the radial null geodesic method side, we study the modifications to\nthe tunneling rate, Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein- Hawking area law by\nincluding the back reaction as well as non-commutative effects in the\nspace-time. A reformulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) method is first\nintroduced. Based on this, a close connection between the quantum tunneling and\nthe gravitational anomaly mechanisms to discuss Hawking effect, is put\nforwarded. An interesting advantage of this reformulated HJ method is that one\ncan get directly the emission spectrum from the event horizon of the black\nhole, which was missing in the earlier literature. Also, the quantization of\nthe entropy and area of a black hole is discussed in this method. Another part\nof the thesis is the introduction of a new type of global embedding of curved\nspace-time to higher dimensional Minkowskian space-time (GEMS). Using this a\nunified description of the Hawking and Unruh effects is given. Advantage of\nthis approach is, it simplifies as well as generalises the conventional\nembedding. In addition to the spherically symmetric space-times, the\nKerr-Newman black hole is exemplified. Finally, following the above ideas and\nthe definition of partition function for gravity, it is shown that\nextremization of entropy leads to the Einstein's equations of motion. In this\nframe work, a relation between the entropy, energy and the temperature of a\nblack hole is given where energy is shown to be the Komar expression.\nInterestingly, this relation is the generalized Smarr formula. In this\nanalysis, the GEMS method provides the law of equipartition of energy as an\nintermediate step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 08:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-28"}

Under typical physiological conditions, however, tens to thousands of\nenzymes react in catalyzing thousands to millions of substrates. We study\nenzyme kinetics at these physiologically relevant conditions through a master\nequation including stochasticity and molecular discreteness. From the exact\nsolution of the master equation we find that the waiting times are neither\nindependent nor are they identically distributed, implying that enzymatic\nturnovers form a non-renewal stochastic process. The inverse of the mean\nwaiting time shows strong departures from the Michaelis-Menten equation. The\nwaiting times between consecutive turnovers are anti-correlated, where short\nintervals are more likely to be followed by long intervals and vice versa.\nCorrelations persist beyond consecutive turnovers indicating that multi-scale\nfluctuations govern enzyme kinetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 10:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-18"}

Computationally,\nthis problem is addressed as a linear optimization problem over the \"flux\ncone\". The prior construction of the flux cone is computationally expensive and\nno polynomial-time algorithms are known. Results: Here we show that the output\nmaximization problem in chemical reaction networks is NP-complete. This\nstatement remains true even if all reactions are monomolecular or bimolecular\nand if only a single molecular species is used as influx. As a corollary we\nshow, furthermore, that the detection of autocatalytic species, i.e., types\nthat can only be produced from the influx material when they are present in the\ninitial reaction mixture, is an NP-complete computational problem.

To large extent, cooling is\noffset by heating due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) via jets. The cool-core\nclusters, with cooler/denser plasmas, show multiphase gas and signs of some\ncooling in their cores. These observations suggest that the cool core is\nlocally thermally unstable while maintaining global thermal equilibrium. Using\nhigh-resolution, three-dimensional simulations we study the formation of\nmultiphase gas in cluster cores heated by highly-collimated bipolar AGN jets.\nOur key conclusion is that spatially extended multiphase filaments form only\nwhen the instantaneous ratio of the thermal instability and free-fall\ntimescales (t_TI/t_ff) falls below a critical threshold of \\approx 10. When\nthis happens, dense cold gas decouples from the hot ICM phase and generates\ninhomogeneous and spatially extended Halpha filaments. These cold gas clumps\nand filaments `rain' down onto the central regions of the core, forming a cold\nrotating torus and in part feeding the supermassive black hole. Consequently,\nthe self-regulated feedback enhances AGN heating and the core returns to a\nhigher entropy level with t_TI/t_ff > 10. Eventually the core reaches\nquasi-stable global thermal equilibrium, and cold filaments condense out of the\nhot ICM whenever t_TI/t_ff \\lesssim 10. This occurs despite the fact that the\nenergy from AGN jets is supplied to the core in a highly anisotropic fashion.\nThe effective spatial redistribution of heat is enabled in part by the\nturbulent motions in the wake of freely-falling cold filaments. Increased AGN\nactivity can locally reverse the cold gas flow, launching cold filamentary gas\naway from the cluster center. Our criterion for the condensation of spatially\nextended cold gas is in agreement with observations and previous idealized\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 12:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Here we present\nexperimental work that suggests the reality is far different: for an exhaustive\ncensus of 81,800,394 one-vertex triangulations that span 1,901 distinct closed\norientable 3-manifolds, we never need to add more than two extra tetrahedra, we\nnever need more than a handful of Pachner moves (or bistellar flips), and the\naverage number of Pachner moves decreases as the number of tetrahedra grows. If\nthey generalise, these extremely surprising results would have significant\nimplications for decision algorithms and the study of triangulations in\n3-manifold topology.\n  Key techniques include polynomial-time computable signatures that identify\ntriangulations up to isomorphism, the isomorph-free generation of non-minimal\ntriangulations, theoretical operations to reduce sequences of Pachner moves,\nand parallel algorithms for studying finite level sets in the infinite Pachner\ngraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 13:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-28"}

We propose a\nsystematic way to parametrize the effect of the coupling as a function of only\nthe variables of a system of interest. Our focus is on describing the impacts\nof the coupling on the long-term statistics rather than on the finite-time\nbehaviour. By direct calculation, we find that, at first order, the coupling\ncan be surrogated by adding a deterministic perturbation to the autonomous\ndynamics of the system of interest. At second order, there are additionally two\nseparate and very different contributions. One is a term taking into account\nthe second order contributions of the fluctuations in the coupling, which can\nbe parametrized as a stochastic forcing with given spectral properties. The\nother one is a memory term, coupling the system of interest to its previous\nhistory, through the correlations of the second system. If these correlations\nare known, this effect can be implemented as a perturbation with memory on the\nsingle system. In order to treat this case, we present an extension to Ruelle's\nresponse theory able to deal with integral operators. We discuss our results in\nthe context of other methods previously proposed to disentangle the dynamics of\ntwo coupled systems.

We detect significant gamma-ray emission from\ndark neutral gas for a mass corresponding to ~40% of that traced by CO.

This paper explores a different\npossibility, in which light is still assumed to propagate isotropically in all\nframes with an invariant speed, yet other physical effects exhibit a direction\ndependence. If spatial isotropy is not assumed in the derivation of the\ncoordinates transformations, the resulting equations differ from the Lorentz\nrelations by an additional factor $(\\dfrac{c - v}{c + v})^{\\kappa}$, where\n$\\kappa$ is the anisotropy exponent, which depends on the direction chosen as\nthe x-axis.
