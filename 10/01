However, groups can be easily blocked from\ncommunicating through blocking of posts with the given hashtags. We propose\n#h00t, a system for censorship resistant microblogging. #h00t presents an\ninterface that is much like Twitter, except that hashtags are replaced with\nvery short hashes (e.g., 24 bits) of the group identifier. Naturally, with such\nshort hashes, hashtags from different groups may collide and #h00t users will\nactually seek to create collisions. By encrypting all posts with keys derived\nfrom the group identifiers, #h00t client software can filter out other groups'\nposts while making such filtering difficult for the adversary. In essence, by\nleveraging collisions, groups can tunnel their posts in other groups' posts. A\ncensor could not block a given group without also blocking the other groups\nwith colliding hashtags. We evaluate the feasibility of #h00t through traces\ncollected from Twitter, showing that a single modern computer has enough\ncomputational throughput to encrypt every tweet sent through Twitter in real\ntime. We also use these traces to analyze the bandwidth and anonymity tradeoffs\nthat would come with different variations on how group identifiers are encoded\nand hashtags are selected to purposefully collide with one another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 16:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-03"}

Using the access log, it is\neasy to answer simple queries (e.g., Who accessed Alice's medical record?), but\nthis often does not provide enough information. In addition to learning who\naccessed their medical records, patients will likely want to understand why\neach access occurred. In this paper, we introduce the problem of generating\nexplanations for individual records in an access log. The problem is motivated\nby user-centric auditing applications, and it also provides a novel approach to\nmisuse detection. We develop a framework for modeling explanations which is\nbased on a fundamental observation: For certain classes of databases, including\nEHRs, the reason for most data accesses can be inferred from data stored\nelsewhere in the database. For example, if Alice has an appointment with Dr.\nDave, this information is stored in the database, and it explains why Dr. Dave\nlooked at Alice's record. Large numbers of data accesses can be explained using\ngeneral forms called explanation templates. Rather than requiring an\nadministrator to manually specify explanation templates, we propose a set of\nalgorithms for automatically discovering frequent templates from the database\n(i.e., those that explain a large number of accesses). We also propose\ntechniques for inferring collaborative user groups, which can be used to\nenhance the quality of the discovered explanations. Finally, we have evaluated\nour proposed techniques using an access log and data from the University of\nMichigan Health System.

In this paper, we develop new proof\nprotocols for verifying computations which are streaming in nature: the\nverifier (data owner) needs only logarithmic space and a single pass over the\ninput, and after observing the input follows a simple protocol with a prover\n(service provider) that takes logarithmic communication spread over a\nlogarithmic number of rounds.

The guarantee is very strong: even if the service provider deliberately\ntries to cheat, there is only vanishingly small probability of doing so\nundetected, while a correct computation is always accepted.

Our main results then seek to bridge the gap between theory\nand practice by developing usable protocols for a variety of problems of\ncentral importance in streaming and database processing.

Spintronics describes the transport of charge and angular momentum by\nmaking use of separate spin-up and spin-down channels. Recently, the merger of\nthermoelectricity with spintronics has given rise to a novel and rich research\nfield named spin caloritronics.

This material allows at low temperature to\ntune the superconductivity down to a strongly insulating state. It results from\nthe combination of a proximity-induced superconductivity generated by the\nmetallic nanoparticles array with the two-dimensional and tunable metallicity\nof graphene. The resulting hybrid material behaves, as a whole, like a granular\n2D superconductor showing universal transition threshold and localization of\nCooper pairs in the insulating phase. This experiment sheds light on the\nemergence of superconductivity in inhomogeneous superconduc- tors, and more\ngenerally it demonstrates the potential of graphene as a versatile\nbuilding-block for the realization of novel superconducting materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 17:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 22:03:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 17:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The general approach\nis illustrated by analyzing the coupling of biexciton and exciton in CdSe\nspherical nanocrystals.

The ratio of\nspherically averaged intracluster medium (ICM) pressures obtained from SZ and\nX-ray measurements depends only on the ICM intrinsic shape, projection\norientation, and H_0, which provides another illustration of how cluster\ngeometry can be recovered through a combination of X-ray and SZ measurements.\nWe also demonstrate that Y_SZ and Y_X have different biases owing to spherical\naveraging, which leads to an offset in the spherically averaged Y_SZ - Y_X\nrelation. A potentially useful application of the analytical formulas presented\nis to assess the error range of an observable (e.g., mass, Y_SZ) accounting for\ndeviations from assumed spherical symmetry, without having to perform the\nellipsoidal deprojection explicitly.

M is typically\nlarge and X will usually have M rows associated with each of the M decisions to\nmake, but for each row the data may be low dimensional. A Bayesian\ndecision-theoretic approach for this problem is implemented with the overall\nloss function being a cost-weighted linear combination of Type I and Type II\nloss functions. The class of loss functions considered allows for the use of\nthe false discovery rate (FDR), false nondiscovery rate (FNR), and missed\ndiscovery rate (MDR) in assessing the decision. Through this Bayesian paradigm,\nthe Bayes multiple decision function (BMDF) is derived and an efficient\nalgorithm to obtain the optimal Bayes action is described. In contrast to many\nworks in the literature where the rows of the matrix X are assumed to be\nstochastically independent, we allow in this paper a dependent data structure\nwith the associations obtained through a class of frailty-induced Archimedean\ncopulas. In particular, non-Gaussian dependent data structure, which is the\nnorm rather than the exception when dealing with failure-time data, can be\nentertained. The numerical implementation of the determination of the Bayes\noptimal action is facilitated through sequential Monte Carlo techniques. The\nmain theory developed could also be extended to the problem of multiple\nhypotheses testing, multiple classification and prediction, and\nhigh-dimensional variable selection. The proposed procedure is illustrated for\nthe simple versus simple and for the composite hypotheses setting via\nsimulation studies.

In the single degenerate scenario of SNe Ia, two\nmain channels are known, i.e., WD + main sequence (MS) channel and WD + red\ngiant (RG) channel. In each channel, a typical binary undergoes three\nevolutional stages before explosion, i.e., the wind phase, supersoft X-ray\nsource (SSS) phase, and recurrent nova phase in order of time because the\naccretion rate decreases with time as the companion mass decreases.

Furthermore, the strong Bombieri-Lang conjecture\nimplies that for each genus $g \\ge 2$, there is an absolute bound $C(g)$\ndepending on the genus -- but not on the field -- such that over any number\nfield, only finitely many curves of genus $g$ have more than $C(g)$ points.\nAgain we can ask what those two bounds are and, as it turns out, it helps to\nconsider families that come from K3 surfaces.

We extend this result to\nnonautonomous linear systems, provided the time dependent system is not too far\nfrom the autonomous system obtained by taking the time to be 0 in the dynamics.\nUsing a linearization approach, we prove a bang-bang principle, valid in\ndimensions 2 and 3 for a class of nonlinear systems, affine and symmetric with\nrespect to the control. Moreover we show that, for two dimensional systems, the\nreachable set from the origin satisfies the same polynomial strict convexity\nproperty as for the linearized dynamics, provided the nonlinearity is small\nenough. Finally, under the same assumptions we show that the epigraph of the\nminimum time function has positive reach, hence proving the first result of\nthis type in a nonlinear setting. In all the above results, we require that the\nlinearization at the origin be normal. We provide examples showing the\nsharpness of our assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2011 09:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-04"}

We develop such processes with\nparticular emphasis on being able to unbiasedly simulate them on a personal\ncomputer.

In particular, the rate of converge in $L_1$ is of the order\n$\\mathcal {O}(\\mathcal{K}^{-1/2})$, $\\mathcal{K}$ denoting the computing cost.\nThe a.s. enfolding of the Brownian path can be exploited in Monte Carlo\napplications involving Brownian paths whence our algorithm (termed the\n$\\varepsilon$-strong algorithm) can deliver unbiased Monte Carlo estimators\nover path expectations, overcoming discretisation errors characterising\nstandard approaches.

We\npresent the design philosophy and summarize the key characteristics of the\ninstrument that will be of interest to potential observers. For faint targets,\nwith flux F_lambda ~ 1.0E10-14 ergs/s/cm2/Angstrom, COS can achieve comparable\nsignal to noise (when compared to STIS echelle modes) in 1-2% of the observing\ntime. This has led to a significant increase in the total data volume and data\nquality available to the community. For example, in the first 20 months of\nscience operation (September 2009 - June 2011) the cumulative redshift\npathlength of extragalactic sight lines sampled by COS is 9 times that sampled\nat moderate resolution in 19 previous years of Hubble observations. COS\nprograms have observed 214 distinct lines of sight suitable for study of the\nintergalactic medium as of June 2011. COS has measured, for the first time with\nhigh reliability, broad Lya absorbers and Ne VIII in the intergalactic medium,\nand observed the HeII reionization epoch along multiple sightlines. COS has\ndetected the first CO emission and absorption in the UV spectra of low-mass\ncircumstellar disks at the epoch of giant planet formation, and detected\nmultiple ionization states of metals in extra-solar planetary atmospheres. In\nthe coming years, COS will continue its census of intergalactic gas, probe\ngalactic and cosmic structure, and explore physics in our solar system and\nGalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
