Many algorithms address this problem as a binary\nclassification problem: given two proteins represented as two vectors of\nfeatures, predict if they interact or not. Importantly however, computational\npredictions are only one component of a larger framework for identifying PPI.\nThe most promising candidate pairs can be validated experimentally by testing\nif they physical bind to each other. Since these experiments are more costly\nand error prone, the computational predictions serve as a filter, aimed to\nproduce a small number of highly promising candidates. Here we propose to\naddress this problem as a ranking problem: given a network with known\ninteractions, rank all unknown pairs based on the likelihood of their\ninteractions.\n  In this paper we propose a ranking algorithm that trains multiple\ninter-connected models using a passive aggressive on-line approach. We show\ngood results predicting protein-protein interactions for post synaptic density\nPPI network. We compare the precision of the ranking algorithm with local\nclassifiers and classic support vector machine. Though the ranking algorithm\noutperforms the classic SVM classification, its performance is inferior\ncompared to the local supervised method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2011 16:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

Such distribution functions usually\nrely on additional hyperparameters which need to be tuned in order to achieve\noptimum predictive performance; this operation can be efficiently performed in\nan Empirical Bayes fashion by maximizing the posterior marginal likelihood of\nthe observed data. Since the score function of this optimization problem is in\ngeneral characterized by the presence of local optima, it is necessary to\nresort to global optimization strategies, which require a large number of\nfunction evaluations. Given that the evaluation is usually computationally\nintensive and badly scaled with respect to the dataset size, the maximum number\nof observations that can be treated simultaneously is quite limited. In this\npaper, we consider the case of hyperparameter tuning in Gaussian process\nregression. A straightforward implementation of the posterior log-likelihood\nfor this model requires O(N^3) operations for every iteration of the\noptimization procedure, where N is the number of examples in the input dataset.\nWe derive a novel set of identities that allow, after an initial overhead of\nO(N^3), the evaluation of the score function, as well as the Jacobian and\nHessian matrices, in O(N) operations. We prove how the proposed identities,\nthat follow from the eigendecomposition of the kernel matrix, yield a reduction\nof several orders of magnitude in the computation time for the hyperparameter\noptimization problem.

No inhibitory coherence is observed in a\nhomogeneous ensemble composed of only subthreshold neurons (which cannot fire\nspontaneously without noise). By increasing the fraction of (spontaneously\nfiring) suprathreshold neurons $P_{supra}$, heterogeneity-induced inhibitory\ncoherence is investigated in a heterogeneous ensemble of subthreshold and\nsuprathreshold neurons. As $P_{supra}$ passes a threshold $P_{supra}^*$,\nsuprathreshold neurons begin to synchronize and play the role of coherent\ninhibitors for the emergence of inhibitory coherence. Thus,\nregularly-oscillating ensemble-averaged global potential appears for $P_{supra}\n> P_{supra}^*$. For this coherent case suprathreshold neurons exhibit coherent\nmixed-mode oscillations with a fast subthreshold (small-amplitude) hopping\nfrequency and a lower spiking frequency. By virtue of their coherent\ninhibition, sparsely synchronized suprathreshold neurons suppress noisy\nactivities of subthreshold neurons. Thus, only coherent subthreshold hoppings\nappear in the individual potentials of subthreshold neurons.

This is in contrast to the periodically forced case where the\nsilent state transforms directly to a chaotic bursting state. Using a rational\napproximation to the quasiperiodic forcing, the mechanism for the appearance of\nsuch an SN bursting state is investigated. Thus, a smooth torus (corresponding\nto a silent state) is found to transform to an SN bursting attractor through a\nphase-dependent subcritical period-doubling bifurcation. These SN bursting\nstates, together with chaotic bursting states, are characterized in terms of\nthe interburst interval, the bursting length, and the number of spikes in each\nburst.

Yet, in practical\nrealizations and experiments, the measuring devices at the receiver's (Bob)\nsite commonly do not measure a two-dimensional system but rather a quantum\nspace of a larger dimension. Such an enlargement sometimes results from\nimperfect devices. However, in various QKD protocols such enlargement exists\neven in the ideal scenario when all devices are assumed to be perfect. This\nissue is common, for instance, in QKD schemes implemented via photons, where\nthe parties' devices are based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers, as these\ninherently enlarge the quantum space in use.\n  We show how space enlargement at Bob's site exposes the implemented protocol\nto new kinds of attacks, attacks that have not yet been explicitly pinpointed\nnor rigorously analyzed. We name these the \"reversed space attacks\".

Interestingly, RCBs are strongly suspected to be the evolved merger\nproduct of two white dwarfs and could therefore be an important tool to\nunderstand Supernovae type Ia in the double degenerate scenario. Constraints on\nthe spatial distribution and the formation rate of such stars are needed to\npicture their origin and test it in the context of actual population synthesis\nresults. To do so, it is crucial to increase significantly the number of known\nRCBs. With an absolute magnitude $\\mathrm{M_V\\sim-5}$ and a bright/hot\ncircumstellar shell made of amorphous carbon grains, RCBs are really\ndistinctive stars. Mono-epoch mid-infrared data can help us to discriminate\nRCBs among other dust-producing stars. The aim is to produce from the WISE and\n2MASS infrared catalogues a new catalogue of reasonable size, enriched with RCB\nstars. Colour-Colour cuts used on all stars detected are the main selection\ncriteria. The selection efficiency was monitored using the 52 known RCBs. It\nhas been found that selection cuts in mid-infrared colour-colour diagrams are a\nvery efficient method of discriminating RCBs from other stars. An RCB enriched\ncatalogue made of only 1602 stars, with a high detection efficiency of about\n77%, was produced. Spectral energy distributions of 49 known RCBs and 5 known\nHdCs are also presented with estimates of their photosphere and circumstellar\nshell temperatures. The newly released WISE all sky catalogue has proven to be\na valuable resource in finding RCB stars. Actual scenarios predict that between\n100 and 500 RCBs exist in our Galaxy. The newly created RCB enriched catalogue\nis an important step forward to significantly increase the number of known RCB\nstars and therefore better understand their origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2011 05:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

More formally,\nfor every \\epsilon>0, 0<p<1 and n =(1/\\epsilon)^{O(1/p\\epsilon)} we give a\nconstruction of a two-write WOM code of length n and capacity\nH(p)+1-p-\\epsilon. Since the capacity of a two-write WOM code is max_p\n(H(p)+1-p), we get a code that is \\epsilon-close to capacity. Furthermore,\nencoding and decoding can be done in time O(n^2.poly(log n)) and time\nO(n.poly(log n)), respectively, and in logarithmic space.\n  We obtain a new encoding scheme for 3-write WOM codes over the binary\nalphabet.

Given the loose constraints imposed by these factors,\nthe derivation of parameters based only on photometry may be uncertain,\nespecially for the poorly-populated clusters. We consider a wide range of\ncluster {\\em (i)} mass and {\\em (ii)} age, and different values of {\\em (iii)}\ndistance modulus, {\\em (iv)} differential and {\\em (v)} foreground reddenings.\nPhotometric errors and their relation with magnitude are also taken into\naccount.

The outflow or\nwind can shed light on the internal structure obscured by the AGN torus.\nRecently, it has been shown that this outflow is rotating in the BAL quasar PG\n1700+518, further supporting the accretion disc origin of the wind. With the\npurpose of giving independent constraints on the wind geometry, we performed\nhigh-resolution European VLBI Network (EVN) observations at 1.6 GHz in 2010.\nCombining the VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) results with the Very\nLarge Array (VLA) archival data at 8.4 GHz, we present its jet structure on\nscales of parsec (pc) to kiloparsec (kpc) for the first time. The source shows\ntwo distinct jet features in East-West direction with a separation of around 4\nkpc. The Eastern feature, which has so far been assumed to hide the core, is a\nkpc-scale hot spot, which is completely resolved out in the EVN image. In the\nwestern jet feature, we find a compact jet component, which pinpoints the\nposition of the central black hole in the galaxy.
