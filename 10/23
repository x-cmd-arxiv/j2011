The small-scale nature of spacetime can be tested with observations of\ndistant quasars. We comment on a recent paper by Tamburini et al. (A&A, 533,\n71) which claims that Hubble Space Telescope observations of the most distant\nquasars place severe constraints on models of foamy spacetime.\n  Methods. If space is foamy on the Planck scale, photons emitted from distant\nobjects will accumulate uncertainties in distance and propagation directions\nthus affecting the expected angular size of a compact object as a function of\nredshift. We discuss the geometry of foamy spacetime, and the appropriate\ndistance measure for calculating the expected angular broadening. We also\naddress the mechanics of carrying out such a test. We draw upon our previously\npublished work on this subject (Christiansen et al. 2011), which carried out\nsimilar tests as Tamburini et al. and also went considerably beyond their work\nin several respects.\n  Results. When calculating the path taken by photons as they travel from a\ndistant source to Earth, one must use the comoving distance rather than the\nluminosity distance. This then also becomes the appropriate distance to use\nwhen calculating the angular broadening expected in a distant source. The use\nof the wrong distance measure causes Tamburini et al. to overstate the\nconstraints that can be placed on models of spacetime foam. In addition, we\nconsider the impact of different ways of parametrizing and measuring the\neffects of spacetime foam.

The spectral points (bound and\nresonant states) can therefore be located in a rigorous way, namely, as zeros\nof the Jost matrix determinant.

The method offers very accurate way of calculating not\nonly total widths of resonances but their partial widths as well.

We find a wide range of moderate to high albedos for\ncandidate S-type asteroids that are analogous to the S-complex defined by\nprevious spectrophotometrically-based taxonomic systems. The candidate C-type\nasteroids, while generally very dark, have a tail of higher albedos that\noverlaps the S types. The albedo distribution for asteroids with a\nphotometrically derived Q classification is extremely similar to those of the S\ntypes. Asteroids with similar colors to (4) Vesta have higher albedos than the\nS types, and most have orbital elements similar to known Vesta family members.\nFinally, we show that the relative reflectance at 3.4 and 4.6 $\\mu$m is higher\nfor D-type asteroids and suggest that their red visible and near-infrared\nspectral slope extends out to these wavelengths. Understanding the relationship\nbetween size, albedo, and taxonomic classification is complicated by the fact\nthat the objects with classifications were selected from the\nvisible/near-infrared Sloan Moving Object Catalog, which is biased against\nfainter asteroids, including those with lower albedos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2011 20:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

For example, they have been successfully employed in\ncorrespondence, registration, and retrieval tasks. In the recent years,\nsignificant attention has been devoted to descriptors obtained from the\nspectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the\nshape. Notable examples in this family are the heat kernel signature (HKS) and\nthe wave kernel signature (WKS). Laplacian-based descriptors achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in numerous shape analysis tasks; they are\ncomputationally efficient, isometry-invariant by construction, and can\ngracefully cope with a variety of transformations. In this paper, we formulate\na generic family of parametric spectral descriptors. We argue that in order to\nbe optimal for a specific task, the descriptor should take into account the\nstatistics of the corpus of shapes to which it is applied (the \"signal\") and\nthose of the class of transformations to which it is made insensitive (the\n\"noise\"). While such statistics are hard to model axiomatically, they can be\nlearned from examples. Following the spirit of the Wiener filter in signal\nprocessing, we show a learning scheme for the construction of optimal spectral\ndescriptors and relate it to Mahalanobis metric learning. The superiority of\nthe proposed approach is demonstrated on the SHREC'10 benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2011 04:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-25"}

Consequently, the interior of every black hole\nbecomes a new universe that expands from a nonsingular bounce. We consider\ngravitational collapse of fermionic spin-fluid matter with the stiff equation\nof state in a stellar black hole. Such a collapse increases the mass of the\nmatter, which occurs through the Parker-Zel'dovich-Starobinskii quantum\nparticle production in strong, anisotropic gravitational fields. The subsequent\npair annihilation changes the stiff matter into an ultrarelativistic fluid.

Variational criteria for determination\nof foci of planar curvilinear mirrors illuminated by a coplanar light source\nare studied in the realm of Geometric Optics. Intrinsic functions of the\noptical setup (called focal potentials in the text) which are stationary at\nmirror points corresponding to cusp points of the caustic of reflected light\nrays are analyzed. The eccentricity of the osculating conic defined at each\nmirror point is shown to be a dimensionless, coordinate independent focal\npotential. An application to numerical analysis of light focusing by\nlaser-illuminated hydrodynamic solitons is presented.\n  OCIS codes: 080.0080 (Geometric Optics) 110.0110 (Imaging Systems) PACS code:\n47.35.Fg (Solitons in Fluids)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2011 15:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-25"}

The\nemotion state of an agent,quantified by the arousal and the valence, fluctuates\nin time due to events on the connected posts, and in the moments of agent's\naction it is transferred to a selected post. We claim that the indirect\ncommunication of the emotion in the model rules, combined with the action-delay\ntime and the circadian rhythm extracted from the empirical data, can explain\nthe genesis of emotional bursts by users on popular Blogs and similar Web\nportals. The model also identifies the parameters and how they influence the\ncourse of the dynamics.\n  Conclusions: The collective behavior is here recognized by the emergence of\ncommunities on the network and the fractal time-series of their emotional\ncomments, powered by the negative emotion (critique). The evolving agents\ncommunities leave characteristic patterns of the activity in the phase space of\nthe arousal--valence variables, where each segment represents a common emotion\ndescribed in psychology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2011 15:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-25"}

For example, the hypotheses can be about the\npresence of a weak classical signal continuously coupled to a quantum sensor,\nor about competing quantum or classical models of the dynamics of a system.\nThis generalization makes the theory useful for quantum detection and\nexperimental tests of quantum mechanics in general. In the case of continuous\nmeasurements, the theory is significantly simplified to produce compact\nformulae for the likelihood ratio, the central quantity in statistical\nhypothesis testing. The likelihood ratio can then be computed efficiently in\nmany cases of interest.
