An\noscillation in a Lagrangian trajectory is represented mathematically as the\nsignal traced out as a particle orbits a time-varying ellipse, a model which\ncaptures wavelike motions as well as the displacement signal of a particle\ntrapped in an evolving vortex. Such oscillatory features can be separated from\nthe turbulent background flow through an analysis founded upon a complex-valued\nwavelet transform of the trajectory. Application of the method to a set of one\nhundred modeled trajectories shows that the oscillatory motions of Lagrangian\nparticles orbiting vortex cores appear to be extracted very well by the method,\nwhich depends upon only a handful of free parameters and which requires no\noperator intervention. Furthermore, vortex motions are clearly distinguished\nfrom wavelike meandering of the jet---the former are high frequency, nearly\ncircular signals, while the latter are linear in polarization and at much lower\nfrequencies. This suggests that the proposed method can be useful for\nidentifying and studying vortex and wave properties in large Lagrangian\ndatasets.

The introduction of broadband wireless mobile\nad hoc networks (MANETs) and cellular networks together with increased\ncomputational power have opened the door for a new breed of applications to be\ncreated, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time\nmultimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly\nchallenging task since these applications have strict quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional Internet\nprotocol (IP)-based best effort service is not able to meet these stringent\nrequirements. The time-varying nature of wireless channels and resource\nconstrained wireless devices make the problem even more difficult.

Cross layer design is a well-known approach to achieve this\nadaptation. In cross-layer design, the challenges from the physical wireless\nmedium and the QoS-demands from the applications are taken into account so that\nthe rate, power, and coding at the physical (PHY) layer can adapted to meet the\nrequirements of the applications given the current channel and network\nconditions.

In this framework, extremes are basically identified with the block\nmaxima of the time series of the chosen observable, in the limit of infinitely\nlong blocks. It has been proved that, assuming suitable mixing conditions for\nthe underlying dynamical systems, the extremes of a specific class of\nobservables are distributed according to the so called Generalized Extreme\nValue (GEV) distribution. Direct calculations show that in the case of\nquasi-periodic dynamics the block maxima are not distributed according to the\nGEV distribution. In this paper we show that, in order to obtain a universal\nbehaviour of the extremes, the requirement of a mixing dynamics can be relaxed\nif the Pareto approach is used, based upon considering the exceedances over a\ngiven threshold. Requiring that the invariant measure locally scales with a\nwell defined exponent - the local dimension -, we show that the limiting\ndistribution for the exceedances of the observables previously studied with the\nGnedenko approach is a Generalized Pareto distribution where the parameters\ndepends only on the local dimensions and the value of the threshold. This\nresult allows to extend the extreme value theory for dynamical systems to the\ncase of regular motions. We also provide connections with the results obtained\nwith the Gnedenko approach.

This is done with quasi-free\nmeson photoproduction off the bound neutron and supplemented with the\nmeasurement of coherent photoproduction reactions, serving as spin and/or\nisospin filters. Furthermore, photoproduction from light and heavy nuclei is a\nvery efficient tool for the study of the interactions of mesons with nuclear\nmatter and the in-medium properties of hadrons.

In this work we initiate a study on self-adjusting\nnetworks: networks that use local-distributed mechanisms to adjust the position\nof the nodes (e.g., virtual machines) in the network to best fit the route\nrequests distribution. Finding the optimal placement of nodes is defined as the\nminimum expected path length (MEPL) problem. This is a generalization of the\nminimum linear arrangement (MLA) problem where the network infrastructure is a\nline and the computation is done centrally. In contrast to previous work, we\nstudy the distributed version and give efficient and simple approximation\nalgorithms for interesting and practically relevant special cases of the\nproblem. In particular, we consider grid networks in which the distribution of\nrequests is a symmetric product distribution. In this setting, we show that a\nsimple greedy policy of position switching between neighboring nodes to locally\nminimize an objective function, achieves good approximation ratios. We are able\nto prove this result using the useful notions of expected rank of the\ndistribution and the expected distance to the center of the graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2011 15:18:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2012 15:34:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 13:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}
