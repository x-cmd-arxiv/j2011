W_{k-1}(1-W_k)$, where $(W_k)_{k\\in\\mn}$ are\nindependent copies of a random variable $W$ taking values in $(0,1)$. Assuming\nthat the number of balls equals $n$, let $L_n$ denote the number of empty boxes\nwithin the occupancy range. In the paper we investigate convergence in\ndistribution of $L_n$ in the two cases which remained open after the previous\nstudies. In particular, provided that $\\me |\\log W|=\\me |\\log (1-W)|=\\infty$\nand that the law of $W$ assigns comparable masses to the neighborhoods of 0 and\n1, it is shown that $L_n$ weakly converges to a geometric law. This result is\nderived as a corollary to a more general assertion concerning the number of\nzero decrements of nonincreasing Markov chains. In the case that $\\me |\\log\nW|<\\infty$ and $\\me |\\log (1-W)|=\\infty$ we derive several further possible\nmodes of convergence in distribution of $L_n$. It turns out that the class of\npossible limiting laws for, properly normalized and centered, $L_n$ includes\nnormal laws and spectrally negative stable laws with finite mean. While\ninvestigating the second problem we develop some general results concerning the\nweak convergence of renewal shot-noise processes. This allows us to answer a\nquestion asked in Mikosch and Resnick (2006).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 16:03:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 18:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-19"}

In these approaches, new composite features are typically constructed\nby aggregating the expression levels of several genes. The secondary data\nsources are employed to guide this aggregation. Although many studies claim\nthat these approaches improve classification performance over single gene\nclassifiers, the gain in performance is difficult to assess. This stems mainly\nfrom the fact that different breast cancer data sets and validation procedures\nare employed to assess the performance. Here we address these issues by\nemploying a large cohort of six breast cancer data sets as benchmark set and by\nperforming an unbiased evaluation of the classification accuracies of the\ndifferent approaches. Contrary to previous claims, we find that composite\nfeature classifiers do not outperform simple single gene classifiers. We\ninvestigate the effect of (1) the number of selected features; (2) the specific\ngene set from which features are selected; (3) the size of the training set and\n(4) the heterogeneity of the data set on the performance of composite feature\nand single gene classifiers. Strikingly, we find that randomization of\nsecondary data sources, which destroys all biological information in these\nsources, does not result in a deterioration in performance of composite feature\nclassifiers. Finally, we show that when a proper correction for gene set size\nis performed, the stability of single gene sets is similar to the stability of\ncomposite feature sets. Based on these results there is currently no reason to\nprefer prognostic classifiers based on composite features over single gene\nclassifiers for predicting outcome in breast cancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 16:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 06:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

Erk exists in many different isoforms, of which the most widely\nstudied are Erk1 and Erk2.

In a previous study we observed in-situ crystal\nformation in the disk of EX Lup during its latest outburst in 2008, making the\nobject an ideal laboratory to investigate circumstellar crystal formation and\ntransport. This outburst was monitored by a campaign of ground-based and\nSpitzer Space Telescope observations. Here we modeled the spectral energy\ndistribution of EX Lup in the outburst from optical to millimeter wavelengths\nwith a 2D radiative transfer code. Our results showed that the shape of the SED\nat optical wavelengths was more consistent with a single temperature blackbody\nthan a temperature distribution. We also found that this single temperature\ncomponent emitted 80-100 % of the total accretion luminosity. We concluded that\na thermal instability, the most widely accepted model of EXor outbursts, was\nlikely not the triggering mechanism of the 2008 outburst of EX Lup. Our\nmid-infrared Spitzer spectra revealed that the strength of all crystalline\nbands between 8 and 30 um increased right after the end of the outburst. Six\nmonths later, however, the crystallinity in the 10 um silicate feature complex\ndecreased. Our modeling of the mid-infrared spectral evolution of EXLup showed\nthat, although vertical mixing should be stronger during the outburst than in\nthe quiescent phase, fast radial transport of crystals (e.g., by stellar/disk\nwind) was required to reproduce the observed mid-infrared spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 18:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We use new wide-field near-infrared data in GOODS-S from the\nCANDELS, HUDF09 and ERS programs to select galaxies via photometric redshift\nmeasurements. Our sample consists of 2812 candidate galaxies at z > 3.5,\nincluding 113 at z = 7 to 8. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution\nto a suite of synthetic stellar population models, and measure the value of the\nUV spectral slope (beta) from the best-fit model spectrum. The median value of\nbeta evolves significantly from -1.82 (+0.00,-0.04) at z = 4, to -2.37\n(+0.26,-0.06) at z = 7. Additionally, we find that faint galaxies at z = 7 have\nbeta = -2.68 (+0.39,-0.24) (~ -2.4 after correcting for observational bias);\nthis is redder than previous claims in the literature, and does not require\n\"exotic\" stellar populations to explain their colors. This evolution can be\nexplained by an increase in dust extinction, with the timescale consistent with\nlow-mass AGB stars forming the bulk of the dust. We find no significant (<\n2-sigma) correlation between beta and M_UV when measuring M_UV at a consistent\nrest-frame wavelength of 1500 A. This is particularly true at bright\nmagnitudes, though our results do show evidence for a weak correlation at faint\nmagnitudes when galaxies in the HUDF are considered separately, hinting that\ndynamic range in sample luminosities may play a role.

Utilising numerical models, we investigate how varying\nmetallicities, gas temperatures and velocity dispersions in galaxies impact the\nway CO line emission traces the underlying H2 gas mass, and under what\ncircumstances Xco may differ from the Galactic mean value. We find that, due to\nthe combined effects of increased gas temperature and velocity dispersion, Xco\nis depressed below the Galactic mean in high surface density environments such\nas ULIRGs. In contrast, in low metallicity environments, Xco tends to be higher\nthan in the Milky Way, due to photodissociation of CO in metal-poor clouds. At\nhigher redshifts, gas-rich discs may have gravitationally unstable clumps which\nare warm (due to increased star formation) and have elevated velocity\ndispersions. These discs tend to have Xco values ranging between present-epoch\ngas-rich mergers and quiescent discs at low-z. This model shows that on\naverage, mergers do have lower Xco values than disc galaxies, though there is\nsignificant overlap. Xco varies smoothly with the local conditions within a\ngalaxy, and is not a function of global galaxy morphology. We combine our\nresults to provide a general fitting formula for Xco as a function of CO line\nintensity and metallicity.

However, the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV/optical\nluminosity and stellar mass are smaller, typically a few percent individually\nand ~20% together. On average, clumps are younger by 0.2 dex and denser by a\nfactor of 8 than diffuse components. Clump properties have obvious radial\nvariations in the sense that central clumps are redder, older, more extincted,\ndenser, and less active on forming stars than outskirts clumps. Our results are\nbroadly consistent with a widely held view that clumps are formed through\ngravitational instability in gas-rich turbulent disks and would eventually\nmigrate toward galactic centers and coalesce into bulges.

The interaction of SN ejecta and wind\nsurrounding it is considered to be a power source to illuminate LSNe because\nmany LSNe show the wind signature in their spectra (Type IIn LSNe). However,\nthere also exist LSNe without the spectral features caused by the wind (Type\nIIL LSNe). We show that, even if LSNe are illuminated by the interaction, it is\npossible that they do not show the narrow spectra from the wind if we take into\naccount of non-steady mass loss of their progenitors. When the shock breakout\ntakes place in the dense wind with the density structure \\rho\\propto r^{-w},\nthe ratio of the diffusion timescale in the optically thick region of the wind\n(td) and the shock propagation timescale of the entire wind after the shock\nbreakout (ts) strongly depends on w. For the case w<~1, both timescales are\ncomparable (td/ts \\simeq 1) and td/ts gets smaller as w gets larger. For the\ncase td/ts\\simeq 1, the shock goes through the entire wind just after the light\ncurve (LC) peak and narrow spectral lines from the wind cannot be observed\nafter the LC peak (Type IIL LSNe). If td/ts is much smaller, the shock wave\ncontinues to propagate in the wind after the LC peak and unshocked wind remains\n(Type IIn LSNe). This difference can be obtained only through a careful\ntreatment of the shock breakout condition in a dense wind. The lack of narrow\nLorentzian line profiles in Type IIL LSNe before the LC peak can also be\nexplained by the difference in the density slope.

As long as Reynolds number is high enough,\nregular flutter and tumble motion can be obtained for plates with small and\nlarge Froude numbers respectively. Belmonte et al.

A\nmuch more frequent occurrence could be the death of a star that makes a black\nhole and a weak or absent outgoing shock, but in a progenitor that only has\nenough angular momentum in its outermost layers to make a disk. We consider\nseveral cases where this is likely to occur - blue supergiants with low mass\nloss rates, tidally-interacting binaries involving either helium stars or giant\nstars, and the collapse to a black hole of very massive pair-instability\nsupernovae.

It is known that, for $p=q=1$ or\n$p=q=2$, this task can be accomplished using $m=O(k \\log (n/k))$ non-adaptive\nmeasurements [CRT06] and that this bound is tight [DIPW10,FPRU10,PW11].\n  In this paper we show that if one is allowed to perform measurements that are\nadaptive, then the number of measurements can be considerably reduced.\nSpecifically, for $C=1+eps$ and $p=q=2$ we show - A scheme with $m=O((1/eps)k\nlog log (n eps/k))$ measurements that uses $O(log* k \\log \\log (n eps/k))$\nrounds. This is a significant improvement over the best possible non-adaptive\nbound. - A scheme with $m=O((1/eps) k log (k/eps) + k \\log (n/k))$ measurements\nthat uses /two/ rounds. This improves over the best possible non-adaptive\nbound. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this type.\nAs an independent application, we show how to solve the problem of finding a\nduplicate in a data stream of $n$ items drawn from ${1, 2, ..., n-1}$ using\n$O(log n)$ bits of space and $O(log log n)$ passes, improving over the best\npossible space complexity achievable using a single pass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 23:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}

Areas of well mixed\nreactants are initially separated by infinite gradients. We focus on the\ninitial regime, characterized by a well-defined one-dimensional contact line\nbetween the reactants. The amount of reactant consumed is given by the\ndiffusive flux along this line, and hence relates directly to its length and to\nthe gradients along it. We show both theoretically and numerically that the\nprobability distribution of the modulus of the gradient of the reactants along\nthis contact line multiplied by {\\kappa} does not depend on the diffusion\n{\\kappa} and can be inferred, after a few turnover times, from the joint\ndistribution of the finite time Lyapunov exponent {\\lambda} and the frequency\n1/{\\tau} . The equivalent time {\\tau} measures the stretching time scale of a\nLagrangian parcel in the recent past, while {\\lambda} measures it on the whole\nchaotic orbit. At smaller times, we predict the shape of this gradient\ndistribution taking into account the initial random orientation between the\ncontact line and the stretching direction. We also show that the probability\ndistribution of the reactants is proportional to {\\kappa} and to the product of\nthe ensemble mean contact line length with the ensemble mean of the inverse of\nthe gradient along it. Besides contributing to the understanding of fast\nchemistry in chaotic flows, the present study based on a Lagrangian stretching\ntheory approach provides results that pave the way to the development of\naccurate sub- grid parametrizations in models with insufficient resolution for\ncapturing the length scales relevant to chemical processes, for example in\nClimate-Chemsitry Models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 23:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}

The stochastic block model is a common tool\nfor model-based community detection, and asymptotic tools for checking\nconsistency of community detection under the block model have been recently\ndeveloped. However, the block model is limited by its assumption that all nodes\nwithin a community are stochastically equivalent, and provides a poor fit to\nnetworks with hubs or highly varying node degrees within communities, which are\ncommon in practice. The degree-corrected stochastic block model was proposed to\naddress this shortcoming and allows variation in node degrees within a\ncommunity while preserving the overall block community structure. In this paper\nwe establish general theory for checking consistency of community detection\nunder the degree-corrected stochastic block model and compare several community\ndetection criteria under both the standard and the degree-corrected models. We\nshow which criteria are consistent under which models and constraints, as well\nas compare their relative performance in practice. We find that methods based\non the degree-corrected block model, which includes the standard block model as\na special case, are consistent under a wider class of models and that\nmodularity-type methods require parameter constraints for consistency, whereas\nlikelihood-based methods do not. On the other hand, in practice, the degree\ncorrection involves estimating many more parameters, and empirically we find it\nis only worth doing if the node degrees within communities are indeed highly\nvariable. We illustrate the methods on simulated networks and on a network of\npolitical blogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 00:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 16:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 21:28:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 08:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 05:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

This may be compared to monstrous moonshine, in\nwhich modular functions are attached to elements of the Monster group. One of\nthe most remarkable aspects of monstrous moonshine is the following genus zero\nproperty: the modular functions turn out to be the generators for the function\nfields of their invariance groups. In particular, these invariance groups\ndefine genus zero quotients of the upper half plane. It is therefore natural to\nask if there is an analogue of this property in the Mathieu case, and at first\nglance the answer appears to be negative since not all the discrete groups\narising there have genus zero. On the other hand, in this article we prove that\neach (mock) modular form appearing in the Mathieu correspondence coincides with\nthe Rademacher sum constructed from its polar part. This property, inspired by\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence in physics, was shown previously to be equivalent to\nthe genus zero property of monstrous moonshine. Hence we conclude that this\n\"Rademacher summability\" property serves as the natural analogue of the genus\nzero property in the Mathieu case. Our result constitutes further evidence that\nthe Rademacher method provides a powerful framework for understanding the\nmodularity of moonshine, and leads to interesting physical questions regarding\nthe gravitational duals of the relevant conformal field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 01:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}

The magnetic decay follows a power-law\nand is dominated by the solenoidal component of the ambipolar diffusion mode.\nIn this model, all NSs are assumed to have the same initial magnetic field\nstrength, but different core temperature which do not change as the magnetic\nfield decays. This suggests that the key distinguishing property between\nmagnetars and normal pulsars is that magnetars were born much hotter than\nnormal pulsars, and thus have much longer magnetic field decay time scales,\nresulting in higher surface magnetic field strength even with the same ages of\nnormal pulsars. The above conclusion agrees well with the observed correlations\nbetween the surface temperatures of magnetars and other young NSs, which do not\nagree with the cooling dominated evolution of neutron stars. This suggests a\npossible scenario that heating, perhaps due to magnetic field decay, balances\nneutron star cooling for observed pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 03:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}

The observed $\\Sigma$-map is a\ndirect measurement of the surface mass density of the Intracluster medium(ICM)\ngas. It accounts for 83% of the averaged mass-fraction of the system. This\nsuggests a modified gravity theory at large distances different from Newton's\ninverse-square gravitational law. In this paper, as a cluster scale\ngeneralization of Grumiller's modified gravity model (D. Grumiller, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 105, 211303 (2010)), we present a gravity model with a generalized linear\nRindler potential in Randers-Finslerian spacetime without invoking any dark\nmatter. The galactic limit of the model is qualitatively consistent with the\nMOND and Grumiller's. It yields approximately the flatness of the rotational\nvelocity profile at the radial distance of several kpcs and gives the velocity\nscales for spiral galaxies at which the curves become flattened. Plots of\nconvergence $\\kappa$ for a galaxy cluster show that the peak of the\ngravitational potential has chances to lie on the outskirts of the baryonic\nmass center. Assuming an isotropic and isothermal ICM gas profile with\ntemperature $T=14.8$ keV (which is the center value given by observations), we\nobtain a good match between the dynamical mass $M_\\textmd{T}$ of the main\ncluster given by collisionless Boltzmann equation and that given by the King\n$\\beta$-model. We also consider a Randers+dark matter scenario \\textbf{and a\n$\\Lambda$-CDM model} with the NFW dark matter distribution profile.

Two important factors in this setting\nare: 1) coupled classifier output due to a sum-to-zero constraint, and 2) the\ndense Hessian matrices that arise when computing tree node split gain and node\nvalue fittings. In general, this setting is too complicated for a tractable\nmodel learning algorithm. However, too aggressive simplification of the setting\nmay lead to degraded performance. For example, the original LogitBoost is\noutperformed by ABC-LogitBoost due to the latter's more careful treatment of\nthe above two factors.\n  In this paper we propose techniques to address the two main difficulties of\nthe LogitBoost setting: 1) we adopt a vector tree (i.e. each node value is\nvector) that enforces a sum-to-zero constraint, and 2) we use an adaptive block\ncoordinate descent that exploits the dense Hessian when computing tree split\ngain and node values.

The associated\nradiation pressure is described by a surface integral of the stress-tensor of\nthe field. The read-out field is measured by a monople detector, form which the\neffective distance between the detector and mirror can be obtained. In the\nslow-motion limit of the mirror, we are able to identify various sources of\nquantum noise that lead to uncertainty of the read-out measurement. Since the\nmirror is driven by radiation pressure, the sources of noise, other than the\nshot nose given by the intrinsic fluctuations of the incident state, may also\nresult from random motion of mirror due to radiation pressure fluctuations and\nfrom modified field fluctuations induced by the displacement of the mirror.\nCorrelation between different sources of noise can be established as the\nconsequence of interference between the incident field and the reflected field\nout of the mirror in the read-out measurement. The overall uncertainty is found\nto decrease (increase) due to the negative (positive) correlation. In the case\nof negative correlation, the uncertainty can be lowered than the value\npredicted by the standard quantum limit. We also examine the validity of the\nparticle number approach, which is often used in quantum optics, and compared\nits results with those given by the field theoretical approach.

Several (existing) quality\nmeasures can be (re)formulated based on the so-called co-ranking matrix, which\nsubsumes all rank errors (i.e. differences between the ranking of distances\nfrom every point to all others, comparing the low-dimensional representation to\nthe original data). The measures are often based on the partioning of the\nco-ranking matrix into 4 submatrices, divided at the K-th row and column,\ncalculating a weighted combination of the sums of each submatrix. Hence, the\nevaluation process typically involves plotting a graph over several (or even\nall possible) settings of the parameter K. Considering simple artificial\nexamples, we argue that this parameter controls two notions at once, that need\nnot necessarily be combined, and that the rectangular shape of submatrices is\ndisadvantageous for an intuitive interpretation of the parameter. We debate\nthat quality measures, as general and flexible evaluation tools, should have\nparameters with a direct and intuitive interpretation as to which specific\nerror types are tolerated or penalized. Therefore, we propose to replace K with\ntwo parameters to control these notions separately, and introduce a differently\nshaped weighting on the co-ranking matrix. The two new parameters can then\ndirectly be interpreted as a threshold up to which rank errors are tolerated,\nand a threshold up to which the rank-distances are significant for the\nevaluation. Moreover, we propose a color representation of local quality to\nvisually support the evaluation process for a given mapping, where every point\nin the mapping is colored according to its local contribution to the overall\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 09:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}

The detailed\nstudy of systematics of meson spectra is important also because it acts as\ningredient for estimating the hadronic decay backgrounds in the photon, single\nlepton and dilepton spectra which are the penetrating probes of quark gluon\nplasma. In this work, we parameterize experimentally measured pion spectra and\nthen obtain the spectra of other light mesons using a property known as $m_T$\nscaling. The $m_{T}$ scaled spectra for each meson is compared with\nexperimental data for p+p, d+Au and Au+Au systems at $\\surd s_{NN} $ = 200 GeV.\nThe agreement of the $m_{T}$ scaled and experimental data shapes are excellent\nin most cases and their fitted relative normalization gives ratio of meson to\npion $m_T$ spectra. These ratios are useful to obtain the hadronic decay\ncontribution in photonic and leptonic channels but also point to the\nquantitative changes in the dynamics of the heavy ion collision over p+p\ncollisions. It is shown that, the particles with charm contents behave\ndifferently as compared to pions in d+Au systems and particles either with\nstrange or charm contents behave differently from pions in Au+Au systems. For\nAu+Au system, three centrality classes have been studied which reveal that for\nthe particles like kaon and $\\phi$, peripheral collision data is better\nreproduced as compared to central and their relative ratios with pions also\nincrease as the collisions become more central.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 10:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In the first few minutes of a newborn neutron star's life the Hall\neffect and differential rotation may both be important. We demonstrate that\nthese two ingredients are sufficient for generating a 'shear-Hall instability'\nand for studying its excitation conditions, growth rates, and characteristic\nmagnetic field patterns.\n  Methods. We numerically solve the induction equation in a spherical shell,\nwith a kinematically prescribed differential rotation profile {\\Omega}(s),\nwhere s is the cylindrical radius. The Hall term is linearized about an imposed\nuniform axial field. The linear stability of individual azimuthal modes, both\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric, is then investigated.\n  Results. For the shear-Hall instability to occur, the axial field must be\nparallel to the rotation axis if {\\Omega}(s) decreases outward, whereas if\n{\\Omega}(s) increases outward it must be anti-parallel. The instability draws\nits energy from the differential rotation, and occurs on the short rotational\ntimescale rather than on the much longer Hall timescale. It operates most\nefficiently if the Hall time is comparable to the diffusion time. Depending on\nthe precise field strengths B0, either axisymmetric or non-axisymmetric modes\nmay be the most unstable.\n  Conclusions.

A few principal\neffects have been found in bulk samples. With an onset of the MgB_2\nsuperconductivity, a spectacular drop of the sample resistance has been\ndetected and superconductivity has been observed at temperature up to 20K.\nPoint-contact (PC) spectroscopy has been used to measure directly the\nsuperconducting energy coupling. For small voltage, an excess current and\ndoubling of the PC's normal state conductance have been found. Conductance\npeaks corresponding to three energy gaps are clearly observed. Two of these\ngaps we identified as enhanced \\Delta_{\\pi} and \\Delta_{\\sigma} gaps\noriginating from the MgB_2; the third gap \\Delta_{tr} is more than three times\nlarger than the largest MgB_2 gap. The experimental results provide unambiguous\nevidences for a new type of proximity effect which follows the phase coherency\nscenario of proximity induced superconductivity. Specifically, at low\ntemperature, the p-wave spin-triplet condensate with pairing energy \\Delta_{tr}\nis essentially sustained in LSMO but is incapable to display long-range\nsupercurrent response because of a phase-disordering state. The proximity\ncoupling to MgB_2 restores the long-range phase coherency of the triplet\nsuperconducting state, which, in turn, enhances superconducting state of the\nMgB_2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 12:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The spectra display prominent Hbeta and Hgamma and weak\nFe II lines in emission. An average of all the spectra (corrected for the\norbital motion) also exhibits a very weak line from Mg I. Tomographic\nreconstructions show that the accretion disc is not contributing to the optical\nline emission, which is instead dominated by the irradiated hemisphere of the\ncompanion star facing the neutron star. We could not detect absorption features\nfrom the mass donor star in the spectra. The emission lines appear broad, with\nan intrinsic FWHM of 255+-22 km/s. Under the assumption that the width of the\nFe II emission lines is dominated by rotational broadening, we obtain a lower\nlimit on the compact object mass which is inconsistent with a NS accretor. We\ndiscuss this incongruity and conclude that either the lines are blends of\nunresolved features (although this requires some fine tuning) or they are\nbroadened by additional effects such as bulk gas motion in an outflow. The fact\nthat the Fe II lines slightly lag in phase with respect to the companion star\ncan be understood as outflowing gas consistent with a Black-Widow like\nscenario. Nevertheless, we can not rule out the possibility that blends of\nvarious emission lines cause the apparent phase lag of the Fe II emission lines\nas well as their large width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 12:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We find that a best fit line through\n$\\displaystyle \\log{(\\frac{D_L}{Gpc})}$ versus $\\log{z}$ gives a correlation of\n0.9955 and a sum of squares error (SSE) of 1.95. By comparison, the best fit\n$\\Lambda$CDM gives SSE = 1.79 using $H_o$ = 69.2 km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_{M}$ = 0.29\nand $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ = 0.71. The best fit EdS gives SSE = 2.68 using $H_o$ =\n60.9 km/s/Mpc. The best fit MORC gives SSE = 1.77 and $H_o$ = 73.9 km/s/Mpc\nusing $R = A^{-1}$ = 8.38 Gcy and $m = 1.71\\times 10^{52}$ kg, where $R$ is the\ncurrent graphical proper distance between nodes, $A^{-1}$ is the scaling factor\nfrom our non-trival inner product, and $m$ is the nodal mass. Thus, MORC\nimproves EdS as well as $\\Lambda$CDM in accounting for distance moduli and\nredshifts for type Ia supernovae without having to invoke accelerated\nexpansion, i.e., there is no dark energy and the universe is always\ndecelerating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 18:55:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 14:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Indeed, the null space contains\neverything there is to know about balancing any chemical-reaction equation!\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 04:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-20"}
