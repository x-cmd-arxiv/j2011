In particular, we\nprove an isomorphism between the loop gravity discrete phase space and the\nsymplectic reduction of the continuous phase space with respect to a flatness\nconstraint. This gives for the first time a precise relationship between the\ncontinuum and holonomy-flux variables. Our construction shows that the fluxes\ndepend on the three-geometry, but also explicitly on the connection, explaining\ntheir non commutativity. It also clearly shows that the flux variables do not\nlabel a unique geometry, but rather a class of gauge-equivalent geometries.\nThis allows us to resolve the tension between the loop gravity geometrical\ninterpretation in terms of singular geometry, and the spin foam interpretation\nin terms of piecewise flat geometry, since we establish that both geometries\nbelong to the same equivalence class. This finally gives us a clear\nunderstanding of the relationship between the piecewise flat spin foam\ngeometries and Regge geometries, which are only piecewise-linear flat: While\nRegge geometry corresponds to metrics whose curvature is concentrated around\nstraight edges, the loop gravity geometry correspond to metrics whose curvature\nis concentrated around not necessarily straight edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 16:24:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 02:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 15:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-04"}

BFT systems provide safety and liveness guarantees with\nreasonable assumptions, amongst a set of nodes where at most f nodes display\narbitrarily incorrect behaviors, known as Byzantine faults. Despite this, BFT\nsystems are still rarely used in practice. In this paper we describe our\nexperience, from an application developer's perspective, trying to leverage the\npublicly available and highly-tuned PBFT middleware (by Castro and Liskov), to\nprovide provable reliability guarantees for an electronic voting application\nwith high security and robustness needs.

By using a combination of\nspectral and temporal bases, we can adjust the protocol to be resource\nefficient. We show that DWDM-QKD is well suited to approach the optimal key\ngeneration rate using present-day sources, detectors, and DWDM opti- cal\nnetworks from classical communications, as well as emerging optical\ninterconnect and photonic integrated chip (PIC) systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 18:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-24"}

First, the\ncomputational core is made more efficient by using small amounts of precomputed\ndata, as well as paying attention to CPU instruction pipelining and cache\nusage. Second, Wavemoth makes use of a fast and numerically stable algorithm\nbased on compressing a set of linear operators in a precomputation step. The\nresulting SHT scales as O(L^2 (log L)^2) for the resolution range of practical\ninterest, where L denotes the spherical harmonic truncation degree.

From the\ncharge carrier density dependence of the conductivity and from the measurement\nof the quantum corrections at low magnetic field, we deduce that transport\nproperties in these devices are mainly governed by the Coulomb interaction of\ncarriers with a large concentration of charged impurities. In the QHE regime,\nat high magnetic field and low temperature ($T<1.3 \\textrm{K}$), the Hall\nresistance is measured by comparison with a GaAs based quantum resistance\nstandard using a cryogenic current comparator.

We find that the effect of disrupting the\nalignment with larger-scale structure is a ~2 per cent decrease in the galaxy\ncorrelation function around r=1.8 Mpc/h. Sphericalizing the ellipsoidal\ndistributions of galaxies within haloes decreases the correlation function by\nup to 20 per cent for r<1 Mpc/h. Similar results apply to power spectra and\nredshift-space correlation functions. Models such as those based on the Halo\nOccupation Distribution, which adopt a spherically averaged profile for the\ngalaxy distributions within haloes, will therefore significantly underestimate\nthe clustering on sub-Mpc scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 08:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-18"}

Using\nsilver, the present study shows a remarkable emergent characteristic of\nextensive properties as the size of the system is increased from a single atom\nto bulk - the property (strength) evolves in a staircase manner, as opposed to\nthe intuitively assumed continuous approach to a saturating bulk value. In\nother words, the observed variation with size retains the inherent trait of\nintensive properties in the form of size-independent staircase plateaus. The\nsteps can be explained by simple and necessary geometric configurations that\natoms must assume in their initial approach to bulk. Were it not for these\nobservations, it would have been remarkable to have reported that the observed\nstrength in the limit of a single-atom Ag bridge approaches the theoretical\nlimit, being 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than in bulk single crystals. The\nappearance of steps is acutely sensitive to minute perturbations, and their\nobservation is enabled by pico-level resolution in measured forces and\ndisplacements in highly stable atomic sized bridges. However, suitably\nharnessed, results open the possibility to impart vastly different strengths to\nthe same material based only on its size. This combined with possibility to\nchange the position and height of the steps by mixing elements of different\ndiameters and surface energy, opens a realistic approach to 'materials by\ndesign'. Results also provide an example of the evolutionary trace of an\nemergent physical property in materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 21:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-25"}

Of paramount importance are the transport gap - the difference\nbetween ionization potential and electron affinity - and the exciton binding\nenergy - inferred from the difference between the transport and optical\nabsorption gaps. Transport gaps are commonly established via photoemission and\ninverse photoemission spectroscopy (PES/IPES). However, PES and IPES are\nsurface-sensitive, average over a dynamic lattice, and are subject to extrinsic\neffects, leading to significant uncertainty in gaps. Here, we use density\nfunctional theory and many-body perturbation theory to calculate the\nspectroscopic properties of two prototypical organic semiconductors, pentacene\nand 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), quantitatively\ncomparing with measured PES, IPES, and optical absorption spectra. For bulk\npentacene and PTCDA, the computed transport gaps are 2.4 and 3.0 eV, and\noptical gaps are 1.7 and 2.1 eV, respectively. Computed bulk quasiparticle\nspectra are in excellent agreement with surface-sensitive photoemission\nmeasurements over several eV only if the measured gap is reduced by 0.6 eV for\npentacene, and 0.6-0.9 eV for PTCDA. We attribute this redshift to several\nphysical effects, including incomplete charge screening at the surface, static\nand dynamical disorder, and experimental resolution. Optical gaps are in\nexcellent agreement with experiment, with solid-state exciton binding energies\nof ~0.5 eV for both systems; for pentacene, the exciton is delocalized over\nseveral molecules and exhibits significant charge transfer character.

Through\nextensive numerical studies on the Haldane model with three-body hard-core\nbosons loaded into a TFB, we find convincing numerical evidence of a stable\n$\\nu=1$ bosonic NA-QHE, with the characteristic three-fold quasi-degeneracy of\nground states on a torus, a quantized Chern number, and a robust spectrum gap.\nMoreover, the spectrum for two-quasihole states also shows a finite energy gap,\nwith the number of states in the lower energy sector satisfying the same\ncounting rule as the Moore-Read Pfaffian state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2011 15:54:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 06:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 02:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-23"}

Here we model another type of\nthe network reaction to congestion -- a sharp reduction of the input traffic\nrate through congested routes which occurs on much shorter time scales. We\nconsider the onset of congestion in the Internet where local mismatch between\ndemand and capacity results in traffic losses and show that it can be described\nas a phase transition characterized by strong non-Gaussian loss fluctuations at\na mesoscopic time scale. The fluctuations, caused by noise in input traffic,\nare exacerbated by the heterogeneous nature of the network manifested in a\nscale-free load distribution. They result in the network strongly overreacting\nto the first signs of congestion by significantly reducing input traffic along\nthe communication paths where congestion is utterly negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 18:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

At each time step of tracking, the available bandwidth $R$ needs\nto be distributed among the $N$ sensors in the WSN for the next time step. The\noptimal solution for the bandwidth allocation problem can be obtained by using\na combinatorial search which may become computationally prohibitive for large\n$N$ and $R$. Therefore, we develop two new computationally efficient suboptimal\nbandwidth distribution algorithms which are based on convex relaxation and\napproximate dynamic programming (A-DP). We compare the mean squared error (MSE)\nand computational complexity performances of convex relaxation and A-DP with\nother existing suboptimal bandwidth distribution schemes based on generalized\nBreiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone (GBFOS) algorithm and greedy search.\nSimulation results show that, A-DP, convex optimization and GBFOS yield similar\nMSE performance, which is very close to that based on the optimal exhaustive\nsearch approach and they outperform greedy search and nearest neighbor based\nbandwidth allocation approaches significantly. Computationally, A-DP is more\nefficient than the bandwidth allocation schemes based on convex relaxation and\nGBFOS, especially for a large sensor network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 17:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
