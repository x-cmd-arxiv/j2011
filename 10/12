To this aim, we integrate\nin time the equations of mass and energy conservation under self-regulated\ninstability of a two-component disc of gas and stars. The disc is assumed to be\ncontinuously fed by cold gas at the average cosmological rate. The gas forms\nstars and is partly driven away by stellar feedback. The gas and stars flow\ninward through the disc to a central bulge due to torques that drive angular\nmomentum outwards. The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down\nthe gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains\nthe disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the\ndissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity\ndispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and\ncool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low\ngas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s. We vary the\nmodel parameters that characterize the accreted gas fraction, turbulence\ndissipation rate, star-formation rate, and stellar feedback. We find that as\nlong as the gas input roughly follows the average cosmological rate, the disc\ninstability is a robust phenomenon at high redshift till z~1, driven by the\nhigh surface density and high gas fraction due to the intense cosmological\naccretion. For a broad range of model parameter values, the discs tend to\n`stabilize' at z~0-0.5 as they become dominated by hot stars. When the model\nparameters are pushed to extreme values, the discs may stabilize as early as\nz~2, with the gas loss by strong outflows serving as the dominant stabilizing\nfactor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 16:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The analysis of such temporal\nsequences is challenging and only few methods have been proposed. The\ninformation can be encoded time independent, by means of classical expression\ndifferences for a single time point or in expression profiles over time.\nAvailable methods are limited to unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The\npredictive variables can be identified only by means of wrapper or\npost-processing techniques. This is complicated due to the small number of\nsamples for such studies. Here, we present a supervised learning approach,\ntermed Supervised Topographic Mapping Through Time (SGTM-TT). It learns a\nsupervised mapping of the temporal sequences onto a low dimensional grid. We\nutilize a hidden markov model (HMM) to account for the time domain and\nrelevance learning to identify the relevant feature dimensions most predictive\nover time. The learned mapping can be used to visualize the temporal sequences\nand to predict the class of a new sequence. The relevance learning permits the\nidentification of discriminating masses or gen expressions and prunes\ndimensions which are unnecessary for the classification task or encode mainly\nnoise. In this way we obtain a very efficient learning system for temporal\nsequences. The results indicate that using simultaneous supervised learning and\nmetric adaptation significantly improves the prediction accuracy for\nsynthetically and real life data in comparison to the standard techniques. The\ndiscriminating features, identified by relevance learning, compare favorably\nwith the results of alternative methods.

A mass accretion rate\nof approximately 2 x 10^-8 solar masses per year was derived from the Br gamma\nand Pa beta lines. However, the fluxes of these lines varied by a factor of\nover two during the course of a few months. The continuum also varied, but by\nonly ~30%, and even decreased at a time when the gas emission was increasing.\nThe H I line at 1.083 microns was also found to vary in a manner inconsistent\nwith that of either the hydrogen lines or the dust. Both the gas and dust\nvariabilities indicate significant changes in the region of the inner gas and\nthe inner dust belt that may be common to many young disk systems. If planets\nare responsible for defining the inner edge of the gap, they could interact\nwith the material on time scales commensurate with what is observed for the\nvariations in the dust, while other disk instabilities (thermal,\nmagnetorotational) would operate there on longer time scales than we observe\nfor the inner dust belt. For SAO 206462, the orbital period would likely be 1-3\nyears. If the changes are being induced in the disk material closer to the star\nthan the gap, a variety of mechanisms (disk instabilities, interactions via\nplanets) might be responsible for the changes seen. The He I feature is most\nlikely due to a wind whose orientation changes with respect to the observer on\ntime scales of a day or less.

We perform coupled-cluster calculations to quantify\nto what extent selected closed-shell nuclei in the oxygen and calcium isotopic\nchains can effectively be mapped onto an effective independent-particle\npicture. To do so, we revisit in detail the notion of ESPEs in the context of\nstrongly correlated many-nucleon systems and illustrate the necessity to\nextract ESPEs through the diagonalization of the centroid {\\it matrix}, as\noriginally argued by Baranger. For the purpose of illustration, we analyse the\nimpact of correlations on observable one-nucleon separation energies and\nnon-observable ESPEs in selected closed-shell oxygen and calcium isotopes. We\nthen state and illustrate the non-observability of ESPEs. Similarly to\nspectroscopic factors, ESPEs can indeed be modified by a redefinition of\ninaccessible quantities while leaving actual observables unchanged. This leads\nto the absolute necessity to employ consistent structure and reaction models\nbased on the same nuclear Hamiltonian to extract the shell structure in a\nmeaningful fashion from experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 19:07:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 09:35:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 07:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The application of frequency analysis to cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations of disk galaxies shows that the orbital families occupied by halo\nstars and dark matter particles are very similar, implying that stellar halo\norbits can be used to constrain the DF of the dark matter halo, possibly\nimpacting future direct dark matter detection experiments. An application of\nthese methods to a sample of \\sim 16,000 Milky Way halo and thick disk stars\nfrom the SDSS-SEGUE survey yields a frequency map with strong evidence for\nresonant trapping of halo stars by the Milky Way disk, in a manner predicted by\ncontrolled simulations in which the disk grows adiabatically. The application\nof frequency analysis methods to current and future phase space data for Milky\nWay halo stars will provide new insights into the formation history of the\ndierent components of the Galaxy and the DF of the halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The generic cost of quantum algorithms for\nthese problems is determined by the inverse spectral gap of H for that\neigenstate and the cost of evolving with H for some fixed time. The goal of\nspectral gap amplification is to construct a Hamiltonian H' with the same\neigenstate as H but a bigger spectral gap, requiring that constant-time\nevolutions with H' and H are implemented with nearly the same cost. We show\nthat a quadratic spectral gap amplification is possible when H satisfies a\nfrustration-free property and give H' for these cases. This results in quantum\nspeedups for optimization problems. It also yields improved constructions for\nadiabatic simulations of quantum circuits and for the preparation of projected\nentangled pair states (PEPS), which play an important role in quantum many-body\nphysics. Defining a suitable black-box model, we establish that the quadratic\namplification is optimal for frustration-free Hamiltonians and that no spectral\ngap amplification is possible, in general, if the frustration-free property is\nremoved.

The general agreement about the relevance of the effects\nof space weathering on the spectral properties of S-complex asteroids fails\nwhen some basic quantitative estimates are attempted. In particular, there is\nsevere disagreement regarding the typical timescales for significant spectral\nreddening to occur, ranging from 1 Myr to 1 Gyr. Generally speaking, the\nspectral reddening of an individual object can be considered as the sum of\nthree terms, one (which is relevant for statistical analyses) depending on the\nexposure of the object to space weathering during its lifetime, a second one\ndue to the original surface composition, and a third one (a \"noise\" term) due\nto the combination of poorly constrained effects (e.g., structure and texture\nof the surface). The surface of an asteroid is usually covered by regolith, and\nits presence and properties presumably play a critical role in the weathering\nprocesses. In this paper we discuss the role played by collisional evolution in\naffecting the spectral properties of asteroids and refreshing the surfaces due\nto the formation of ejecta, and the necessity of a simultaneous modeling of\ncollisions and weathering processes. We introduce a new idea, based on the\npossibility of a sort of saturation of the refreshing process whenever a\nmassive reaccumulation of the impact ejecta takes place. In this case, a\ndependence of the overall reddening on the asteroid size should naturally come\nout. We show that this conclusion is indeed supported by available main belt\nasteroid spectroscopic data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 20:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Based on recorded slider motion path data, we developed\nan analysis algorithm that identifies and measures different types of activity\nintervals, including error time moving irrelevant sliders and end time in\nbreaks after completing each trial item. Our results showed a significant\nincrease in speed of the mixing board interaction accompanied by reduced\nperceived cognitive load when compared with the traditional mouse-based GUI\ninteraction. The gains in speed are largely due to the improved times required\nfor the hand to reach for the first slider (acquisition time) and also when\nmoving between different ones, while the actual time spent manipulating\nrelevant sliders is very similar for either input device. These results agree\nstrongly with qualitative predictions from Fitts' Law that the larger targets\nafforded by the mixer handles contributed to its faster performance. For\nfurther investigation, we computed a measure of motion simultaneity based on\nvelocity correlation, which allowed to identify types of items for which\nincreased simultaneous adjustments occur.\n  For continuous parameter space exploration our findings suggest that mixing\nboards are a good option to provide detailed multi-value control.

Using the Hayashi spectral analysis of the extratropical\nwaves, we find that a quasi-stationary (QS) wave five belongs to a wave packet\nobeying a well defined dispersion relation with eastward group velocity. The\ncomponents of the dispersion relation with k>5 baroclinically convert eddy\navailable potential energy into eddy kinetic energy, while those with k<5 are\nbaroclinically neutral. In agreement with the Green's model of baroclinic\ninstability, the wave five is weakly unstable, and the inverse energy cascade,\nwhich had been previously proposed as a main forcing for this type of waves,\nonly acts as a positive feedback on its predominantly baroclinic energetics.\nThe QS wave is reinforced by a phase lock to an analogous pattern in the\ntropical convection, which provides further amplification to the wave. We also\nfind that the Pedlosky bounds on the phase speed of unstable waves provide\nguidance in explaining the latitudinal structure of the energy conversion,\nwhich is shown to be more enhanced where the zonal westerly surface wind is\nweaker. The wave energy is then trapped in the wave guide created by the upper\ntropospheric jet stream. In agreement with Green's theory, as the equator to\npole SST difference is reduced the stationary marginally stable component\nshifts toward higher wavenumbers, while the wave five becomes neutral and\nwestward propagating.

Filters refer to a class of data\nassimilation algorithms designed to update the estimation of the state in a\non-line fashion, as data is acquired sequentially. For linear problems subject\nto Gaussian noise filtering can be performed exactly using the Kalman filter.\nFor nonlinear systems it can be approximated in a systematic way by particle\nfilters. However in high dimensions these particle filtering methods can break\ndown. Hence, for the large nonlinear systems arising in applications such as\nweather forecasting, various ad hoc filters are used, mostly based on making\nGaussian approximations. The purpose of this work is to study the properties of\nthese ad hoc filters, working in the context of the 2D incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equation. By working in this infinite dimensional setting we\nprovide an analysis which is useful for understanding high dimensional\nfiltering, and is robust to mesh-refinement. We describe theoretical results\nshowing that, in the small observational noise limit, the filters can be tuned\nto accurately track the signal itself (filter stability), provided the system\nis observed in a sufficiently large low dimensional space; roughly speaking\nthis space should be large enough to contain the unstable modes of the\nlinearized dynamics. Numerical results are given which illustrate the theory.\nIn a simplified scenario we also derive, and study numerically, a stochastic\nPDE which determines filter stability in the limit of frequent observations,\nsubject to large observational noise. The positive results herein concerning\nfilter stability complement recent numerical studies which demonstrate that the\nad hoc filters perform poorly in reproducing statistical variation about the\ntrue signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 23:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-13"}

Modeling rank\nmodulation involves construction of packings of the space of permutations\nequipped with the Kendall tau distance.\n  We present several general constructions of codes in permutations that cover\na broad range of code parameters. In particular, we show a number of ways in\nwhich conventional error-correcting codes can be modified to correct errors in\nthe Kendall space. Codes that we construct afford simple encoding and decoding\nalgorithms of essentially the same complexity as required to correct errors in\nthe Hamming metric. For instance, from binary BCH codes we obtain codes\ncorrecting $t$ Kendall errors in $n$ memory cells that support the order of\n$n!/(\\log_2n!)^t$ messages, for any constant $t= 1,2,...$ We also construct\nfamilies of codes that correct a number of errors that grows with $n$ at\nvarying rates, from $\\Theta(n)$ to $\\Theta(n^{2})$. One of our constructions\ngives rise to a family of rank modulation codes for which the trade-off between\nthe number of messages and the number of correctable Kendall errors approaches\nthe optimal scaling rate. Finally, we list a number of possibilities for\nconstructing codes of finite length, and give examples of rank modulation codes\nwith specific parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 03:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-13"}

The highest ranked nodes, also referred to as\n\"superspreaders\", are associated to dominant epidemic risks and therefore\ndeserve special attention. In simulations on studied empirical complex\nnetworks, it is shown that the ranking depends on the dynamical regime of the\ndisease spreading. A possible mechanism leading to this dependence is\nillustrated in an analytically tractable example. In systems where the\nallocation of resources to counter disease spreading to individual nodes is\nbased on their ranking, the dynamical regime of disease spreading is frequently\nnot known before the outbreak of the disease. Therefore, we introduce a\nquantity called epidemic centrality as an average over all relevant regimes of\ndisease spreading as a basis of the ranking. A recently introduced concept of\nphase diagram of epidemic spreading is used as a framework in which several\ntypes of averaging are studied. The epidemic centrality is compared to\nstructural properties of nodes such as node degree, k-cores and betweenness.\nThere is a growing trend of epidemic centrality with degree and k-cores values,\nbut the variation of epidemic centrality is much smaller than the variation of\ndegree or k-cores value. It is found that the epidemic centrality of the\nstructurally peripheral nodes is of the same order of magnitude as the epidemic\ncentrality of the structurally central nodes. The implications of these\nfindings for the distributions of resources to counter disease spreading are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 03:21:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 09:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-16"}

The\nultimate goal is to detect the mass and spin of the black hole and provide a\ntest of general relativity in the strong-field regime from the resultant\nquasi-periodic signals. Before accretion starts, the stellar orbit is presumed\nto be circular and equatorial, and shrinks due to gravitational radiation. New\nfitting formulae are presented for the inspiral time and the radiation-reaction\ntorque in the relativistic regime. If the inspiralling star fills its Roche\nlobe outside the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) of the hole, gas will\nflow through the inner Lagrange point (L1) to the hole. We give new\nrelativistic interpolation formulae for the volume enclosed by the Roche lobe.\nIf this mass-transfer happens on a time scale faster than the thermal time\nscale but slower than the dynamical time scale, the star will evolve\nadiabatically, and, in most cases, will recede from the hole while filling its\nRoche lobe.

We define Schur multipliers, and find their co-isometric\nrealization in terms of the associated de Branges-Rovnyak space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 11:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-13"}

We show that roughening and domain dynamics are strongly coupled,\nresulting in qualitatively altered bulk and front properties. For beneficial\nmutations the front is quickly taken over by mutants and growth proceeds\nEden-like. In contrast, if mutants grow slower than wild-types, there is an\nantagonism between selection pressure against mutants and growth by merging of\nmutant domains with an ensuing absorbing state phase transition to an\nall-mutant front. We find that surface roughening has a marked effect on the\ncritical properties of the absorbing state phase transition. While reference\nmodels, which keep the expanding front flat, exhibit directed percolation\ncritical behavior, the exponents of the two-species Eden model strongly deviate\nfrom it. In turn, the mutation-selection process induces an increased surface\nroughness with exponents distinct from that of the classical Eden model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 12:15:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 16:29:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 16:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

This paper\npresents a publicly available chemical network with multi-deuterated species\nand an extended, up-to-date set of gas-phase and surface reactions. To test\nthis network, we simulate deuterium fractionation in diverse interstellar\nsources. Two cases of initial abundances are considered: i) atomic except for\nH2 and HD, and ii) molecular from a prestellar core. We reproduce the observed\nD/H ratios of many deuterated molecules, and sort the species according to\ntheir sensitivity to temperature gradients and initial abundances. We find that\nmany multiply-deuterated species produced at 10 K retain enhanced D/H ratios at\ntemperatures $\\la 100$ K. We study how recent updates to reaction rates affect\ncalculated D/H ratios, and perform a detailed sensitivity analysis of the\nuncertainties of the gas-phase reaction rates in the network. We find that\nuncertainties are generally lower in dark cloud environments than in warm IRDCs\nand that uncertainties increase with the size of the molecule and number of\nD-atoms.

Data from earthbound\ntelescopes also need accurate correction for straylight and fixed optical\naberrations. We aim to develop a method for measuring straylight in the\npost-focus imaging optics of the SST. We removed any influence from atmospheric\nturbulence and scattering by using an artificial target. We measured integrated\nstraylight from three different sources in the same data: ghost images caused\nby reflections in the near-detector optics, PSFs corresponding to wavefront\naberrations in the optics by using phase diversity, and extended scattering PSF\nwings of unknown origin by fitting to a number of different kernels. We\nperformed the analysis separately in the red and blue beams. Wavefront\naberrations, which possibly originate in the bimorph mirror of the adaptive\noptics, are responsible for a wavelength-dependent straylight of 20-30% of the\nintensity in the form of PSFs with 90% of the energy contained within a radius\nof 0.6\". There are ghost images that contribute at the most a few % of\nstraylight. The fraction of other sources of scattered light from the\npost-focus instrumentation of the SST is only \\sim10^-3 of the recorded\nintensity. This contribution has wide wings with FWHM \\sim16\" in the blue and\n\\sim34\" in the red. The present method seems to work well for separately\nestimating wavefront aberrations and the scattering kernel shape and fraction.\nGhost images can be expected at the same level for solar observations.

The\ncorrelation between structure, chemical order, and magnetic behavior is\nanalyzed as a function of size and composition. For $N = m+n \\leq 6$ a thorough\nsampling of all cluster topologies has been performed, while for N = 7 and 8\nonly a few representative topologies are considered. In all cases the entire\nconcentration range is systematically investigated. All the clusters show\nferromagnetic-like order in the optimized structures. As a result, the average\nmagnetic moment per atom $\\bar\\mu_N$ increases monotonously, which is almost\nlinear over a wide range of concentration with Fe content. A remarkable\nenhancement of the local Fe moments beyond 3 $\\mu_B$ is observed as result of\nRh doping. This is a consequence of the increase in the number of Fe $d$ holes,\ndue to charge transfer from Fe to Rh, combined with the extremely reduced local\ncoordination. The Rh local moments, which are important already in the pure\nclusters ($N\\le 8$) are not significantly enhanced by Fe doping. However, the\noverall stability of magnetism, as measured by the energy gained upon spin\npolarization, increases when Rh is replaced by Fe.

The technique also removes emission from\nintermediate-age evolved red objects with a low mass-to-light ratio, such as\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars, revealing maps of\nthe underlying old distribution of light with [3.6]-[4.5] colors consistent\nwith the colors of K and M giants.

We use the\nprotonated dipeptide tryptophane-alanine (HTyrAla+) as a model system, cooled\nby Barium ions to less than 800mK secular temperature. The spectroscopy is\nperformed on the fundamental vibrational transition of a local vibrational mode\nat 2.74 {\\mu}m using a continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator (OPO).\nResonant multi-photon IR dissociation spectroscopy (without the use of a UV\nlaser) generates charged molecular fragments, which are sympathetically cooled\nand trapped, and subsequently released from the trap and counted. We measured\nthe cross section for R-IRMPD under conditions of low intensity, and found it\nto be approximately two orders smaller than the vibrational excitation cross\nsection. The observed rotational bandwidth of the vibrational transition is\nlarger than the one expected from the combined effects of 300 K black-body\ntemperature, conformer-dependent line shifts, and intermolecular vibrational\nrelaxation broadening (J. Stearns et al., J. Chem. Phys., 127, 154322-7\n(2007)). This indicates that as the internal energy of the molecule grows, an\nincrease of the rotational temperature of the molecular ions well above room\ntemperature (up to on the order of 1000K), and/or an appreciable shift of the\nvibrational transition frequency (approx. 6-8 cm$^{-1}$) occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 13:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The task is usually tackled by running the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm several times in order to obtain a high\nlog-likelihood estimate. We argue that choosing the maximum log-likelihood\nestimate (as well as the maximum penalized log-likelihood and the maximum a\nposteriori estimate) has severe drawbacks, being affected both by overfitting\nand model uncertainty. Two ideas are discussed to overcome these issues: a\nmaximum entropy approach and a Bayesian model averaging approach. Both ideas\ncan be easily applied on top of EM, while the entropy idea can be also\nimplemented in a more sophisticated way, through a dedicated non-linear solver.\nA vast set of experiments shows that these ideas produce significantly better\nestimates and inferences than the traditional and widely used maximum\n(penalized) log-likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimates. In particular,\nif EM is adopted as optimization engine, the model averaging approach is the\nbest performing one; its performance is matched by the entropy approach when\nimplemented using the non-linear solver. The results suggest that the\napplicability of these ideas is immediate (they are easy to implement and to\nintegrate in currently available inference engines) and that they constitute a\nbetter way to learn Bayesian network parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 12:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
