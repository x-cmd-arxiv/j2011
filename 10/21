The V773 Tau A binary system, a pair of T Tauri stars\nwith a 51 day orbit, displays such a signature, with peak emission taking place\nnear periastron. This paper proposes that the observed emission arises from the\nchange in energy stored in the composite magnetic field of the system. We model\nthe fields using the leading order (dipole) components and show that this\npicture is consistent with current observations. In this model, the observed\nradiation accounts for a fraction of the available energy of interaction\nbetween the magnetic fields from the two stars. Assuming antisymmetry, we\ncompute the interaction energy $E_{\\rm int}$ as a function of the stellar\nradii, the stellar magnetic field strengths, the binary semi-major axis, and\norbital eccentricity, all of which can be measured independently of the\nsynchrotron radiation. The variability in time and energetics of the\nsynchrotron radiation depend on the details of the annihilation of magnetic\nfields through reconnection events, which generate electric fields that\naccelerate charged particles, and how those charged particles, especially fast\nelectrons, are removed from the interaction region. However, the major\nqualitative features are well described by the background changes in the global\nmagnetic configuration driven by the orbital motion. The theory can be tested\nby observing a collection of pre-main-sequence binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 16:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Since the length of the top row of the Young diagrams is\nalso the length of the longest weakly increasing subsequences of $(X_k)_{1\\le k\n\\le n}$, the corresponding limiting law follows. We relate our results to a\nconjecture of Kuperberg by providing, under a cyclic condition, a spectral\ncharacterization of the Markov transition matrix precisely characterizing when\nthe limiting shape is the spectrum of the $m \\times m$ traceless GUE. For each\n$m \\ge 4$, this characterization identifies a proper, non-trivial class of\ncyclic transition matrices producing such a limiting shape.

To finish, we explore, in this\ngeneral setting, connections between various limiting laws and spectra of\nGaussian random matrices, focusing in particular on the relationship between\nthe terminal points of the Brownian motions, the diagonal terms of the random\nmatrix, and the scaling of its off-diagonal terms, a scaling we conjecture to\nbe a function of the spectrum of the covariance matrix governing the Brownian\nmotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 16:26:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2012 22:56:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 14:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 02:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

This shift is expressed in terms of an increase of the heavy baryon to\nmeson ratio in nuclear with respect to proton collisions.

The\nstellar distribution function (DF) evolves on the longer time scale of\nprecessional motions, whose dynamics is governed by a Hamiltonian, given by the\norbit-averaged self-gravitational potential of the cluster. We specialize to\nrazor-thin, planar discs and consider two counter-rotating (\"$\\pm$\")\npopulations of stars. To describe discs of small eccentricities, we expand the\n$\\pm$ Hamiltonian to fourth order in the eccentricities, with coefficients that\ndepend self-consistently on the $\\pm$ DFs. We construct approximate $\\pm$\ndynamical invariants and use Jeans' theorem to construct time-dependent $\\pm$\nDFs, which are completely described by their centroid coordinates and shape\nmatrices. When the centroid eccentricities are larger than the dispersion in\neccentricities, the $\\pm$ centroids obey a set of 4 autonomous ordinary\ndifferential equations.

On one hand, quantum\nmechanics eliminates the arbitrariness of defining probabilities in the\nmultiverse, as discussed in arXiv:1104.2324. On the other hand, the multiverse\nallows for understanding why we observe an ordered world obeying consistent\nlaws of physics, by providing an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This\nresults in the irreversibility of quantum measurement, despite the fact that\nthe evolution of the multiverse state is unitary.\n  In order to describe the cosmological dynamics correctly, we need to identify\nthe structure of the Hilbert space for a system with gravity. We argue that in\norder to keep spacetime locality, the Hilbert space for dynamical spacetime\nmust be defined only in restricted spacetime regions: in and on the (stretched)\napparent horizon as viewed from a fixed reference frame. This requirement\narises from eliminating all the redundancies and overcountings in a general\nrelativistic, global spacetime description of nature. It is responsible for\nhorizon complementarity as well as the \"observer dependence\" of\nhorizons/spacetime---these phenomena arise to represent changes of the\nreference frame in the relevant Hilbert space.

Evolving A enables one\nto use any interpolation scheme on refinement level boundaries and still\nguarantee that the magnetic field remains divergenceless. As in classical EM, a\ngauge choice must be made when evolving A, and we chose a straightforward\n\"algebraic\" gauge condition to simplify the A evolution equation. However,\nmagnetized black hole-neutron star (BHNS) simulations in this gauge exhibit\nunphysical behavior, including the spurious appearance of strong magnetic\nfields on refinement level boundaries. This spurious behavior is exacerbated\nwhen matter crosses refinement boundaries during tidal disruption of the NS.\nApplying Kreiss-Oliger dissipation to the evolution of the magnetic vector\npotential A slightly weakens this spurious magnetic effect, but with undesired\nconsequences. We demonstrate via an eigenvalue analysis and a numerical study\nthat zero-speed modes in the algebraic gauge, coupled with the frequency\nfiltering that occurs on refinement level boundaries, are responsible for the\ncreation of spurious magnetic fields. We show that the EM Lorenz gauge exhibits\nno zero-speed modes, and as a consequence, spurious magnetic effects are\nquickly propagated away, allowing for long-term, stable magnetized BHNS\nevolutions. Our study demonstrates how the EM gauge degree of freedom can be\nchosen to one's advantage, and that for magnetized BHNS simulations the Lorenz\ngauge constitutes a major improvement over the algebraic gauge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2011 23:30:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 04:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-16"}

We\ncompare the cosmological constraints resulting from the peak abundance measured\nin this way and the abundance obtained by using a filter of fixed size, which\nis the standard practice in WL peak studies.

Moreover, the interior of the ring itself is simply the\nbig test ideal. We directly prove, without appeal to tight closure, results\nanalogous to persistence, colon capturing, and working modulo minimal primes,\nand we begin to develop a theory dual to phantom homology.\n  Using our dual notion of persistence, we obtain new and interesting\ntransformation rules for tight interior, and so in particular for the test\nideal, which complement the main results of a recent paper of the second author\nand K. Tucker. Using our theory of phantom homology, we prove a vanishing\ntheorem for maps of Ext. We also compare our theory to M. Blickle's notion of\nCartier modules, and in the process, we prove new existence results for\nBlickle's test submodule. Finally, we apply the theory we developed to the\nstudy of test ideals in non-normal rings, proving that the finitistic test\nideal coincides with the big test ideal in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 20:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 14:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 23:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

Such a phase forms a crystalline lattice with a\nshear modulus higher than that of the crust due to the high density and charge\nseparation, even allowing for the effects of charge screening. This may lead to\nstrong continuous gravitational-wave emission from rapidly rotating neutron\nstars and gravitational-wave bursts associated with magnetar flares and pulsar\nglitches. We present the first detailed calculation of the shear modulus of the\nmixed phase. We describe the quark phase using the bag model plus first-order\nquantum chromodynamics corrections and the hadronic phase using relativistic\nmean-field models with parameters allowed by the most massive pulsar. Most of\nthe calculation involves treating the \"pasta phases\" of the lattice via\ndimensional continuation, and we give a general method for computing\ndimensionally continued lattice sums including the Debye model of charge\nscreening. We compute all the shear components of the elastic modulus tensor\nand angle average them to obtain the effective (scalar) shear modulus for the\ncase where the mixed phase is a polycrystal. We include the contributions from\nchanging the cell size, which are necessary for the stability of the\nlower-dimensional portions of the lattice. Stability also requires a minimum\nsurface tension, generally tens of MeV/fm^2 depending on the equation of state.\nWe find that the shear modulus can be a few times 10^33 erg/cm^3, two orders of\nmagnitude higher than the first estimate, over a significant fraction of the\nmaximum mass stable star for certain parameter choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 21:16:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 10:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 15:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

HXR (25-100 keV)\nimaging observations show two kernels of size (FWHM) 15?? moving along the two\nUV ribbons. We find the following results. (1) UV brightening is substantially\nenhanced wherever and whenever the compact HXR kernel is passing, and during\nthe HXR transit across a certain region, the UV count light curve in that\nregion is temporally correlated with the HXR total flux light curve. After the\npassage of the HXR kernel, the UV light curve exhibits smooth monotonical\ndecay. (2)We measure the apparent motion speed of the HXR sources and UV ribbon\nfronts, and decompose the motion into parallel and perpendicular motions with\nrespect to the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL). It is found that HXR\nkernels and UV fronts exhibit similar apparent motion patterns and speeds. The\nparallel motion dominates during the rise of the HXR emission, and the\nperpendicular motion starts and dominates at the HXR peak, the apparent motion\nspeed being 10-40 km s-1. (3) We also find that UV emission is characterized by\na rapid rise correlated with HXRs, followed by a long decay on timescales of\n15-30 minutes.

The first-order transition temperature is calculated by the\ndiscontinuity of the magnetization at $T_{c}^{\\ast}(H)$, on the other hand in\nthe continuous transition the magnetization is null at $T=T_{c}(H)$. At null\ntemperature (T=0) we have found the \\textbf{coexistence} field $H_{c}=3.23J$\nthat is independent of spin value. The transition temperature $T_{c}(H)$ for\nthe classical case ($S=\\infty $), in the $T-H$ plane, is larger than the\nquantum case (S=1/2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 00:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-24"}

Young stars interact vigorously with their surroundings, as evident\nfrom the highly rotationally excited CO (up to Eup=4000 K) and H2O emission (up\nto 600 K) detected by the Herschel Space Observatory in embedded low-mass\nprotostars. Our aim is to construct a model that reproduces the observations\nquantitatively, to investigate the origin of the emission, and to use the lines\nas probes of the various heating mechanisms.\n  Methods. The model consists of a spherical envelope with a bipolar outflow\ncavity. Three heating mechanisms are considered: passive heating by the\nprotostellar luminosity, UV irradiation of the outflow cavity walls, and C-type\nshocks along the cavity walls. Line fluxes are calculated for CO and H2O and\ncompared to Herschel data and complementary ground-based data for the\nprotostars NGC1333 IRAS2A, HH 46 and DK Cha. The three sources are selected to\nspan a range of evolutionary phases and physical characteristics.\n  Results. The passively heated gas in the envelope accounts for 3-10% of the\nCO luminosity summed over all rotational lines up to J=40-39; it is best probed\nby low-J CO isotopologue lines such as C18O 2-1 and 3-2. The UV-heated gas and\nthe C-type shocks, probed by 12CO 10-9 and higher-J lines, contribute 20-80%\neach. The model fits show a tentative evolutionary trend: the CO emission is\ndominated by shocks in the youngest source and by UV-heated gas in the oldest\none. This trend is mainly driven by the lower envelope density in more evolved\nsources. The total H2O line luminosity in all cases is dominated by shocks\n(>99%). The exact percentages for both species are uncertain by at least a\nfactor of 2 due to uncertainties in the gas temperature as function of the\nincident UV flux. However, on a qualitative level, both UV-heated gas and\nC-type shocks are needed to reproduce the emission in far-infrared rotational\nlines of CO and H2O.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 00:11:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 20:28:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 10:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Our multi-asset\npricing model arises by employing copula methods. In particular, all discounted\nsingle-asset price processes are modeled as martingale diffusions under a\nrisk-neutral measure. The price processes are so-called UOU diffusions and they\nare each generated by combining a variable (Ito) transformation with a measure\nchange performed on an underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (Gaussian) process.\nConsequently, we exploit the use of a normal bridge copula for coupling the\nsingle-asset dynamics while reducing the distribution of the multi-asset price\nprocess to a multivariate normal distribution. Such an approach allows us to\nsimulate multidimensional price paths in a precise and fast manner and hence to\nprice path-dependent financial derivatives such as Asian-style and Bermudan\noptions using the Monte Carlo method. We also demonstrate how to successfully\ncalibrate our multi-asset pricing model by fitting respective equity option and\nasset market prices to the single-asset models and their return correlations\n(i.e. the copula function) using the least-square and maximum-likelihood\nestimation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 00:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-24"}

Unlike the usual\nscalar measures of reproducibility, our approach creates a curve, which\nquantitatively assesses when the findings are no longer consistent across\nreplicates. Our curve is fitted by a copula mixture model, from which we derive\na quantitative reproducibility score, which we call the \"irreproducible\ndiscovery rate\" (IDR) analogous to the FDR. This score can be computed at each\nset of paired replicate ranks and permits the principled setting of thresholds\nboth for assessing reproducibility and combining replicates. Since our approach\npermits an arbitrary scale for each replicate, it provides useful descriptive\nmeasures in a wide variety of situations to be explored. We study the\nperformance of the algorithm using simulations and give a heuristic analysis of\nits theoretical properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a\nChIP-seq experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 05:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-24"}

In this framework the peak energy of the synchrotron power\n(nu_peak) in blazars is independent of source type and of radio luminosity. We\ntest this new approach, which builds upon unified schemes, using extensive\nMonte Carlo simulations and show that it can provide simple answers to a number\nof long-standing issues including, amongst others, the different cosmological\nevolution of BL Lacs selected in the radio and X-ray bands, the larger nu_peak\nvalues observed in BL Lacs, the fact that high synchrotron peaked blazars are\nalways of the BL Lac type, and the existence of FSRQ/BL Lac transition objects.\nObjects so far classified as BL Lacs on the basis of their observed weak, or\nundetectable, emission lines are of two physically different classes:\nintrinsically weak lined objects, more common in X-ray selected samples, and\nheavily diluted broad lined sources, more frequent in radio selected samples,\nwhich explains some of the confusion in the literature.

The\nphenomenology may include finite pressure anisotropies as well as strong\ntoroidal and poloidal differential rotation, characteristic of Tokamak plasmas.\nDespite the fact that physical phenomena occurring in fusion plasmas depend\nfundamentally on the microscopic particle phase-space dynamics, their\nconsistent kinetic treatment remains still essentially unchalleged to date. The\ngoal of this paper is to address the problem within the framework of\nVlasov-Maxwell description. The gyrokinetic treatment of charged particles\ndynamics is adopted for the construction of asymptotic solutions for the\nquasi-stationary species kinetic distribution functions. These are expressed in\nterms of the particle exact and adiabatic invariants. The theory relies on a\nperturbative approach, which permits to construct asymptotic analytical\nsolutions of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. In this way, both diamagnetic and\nenergy corrections are included consistently into the theory. In particular, by\nimposing suitable kinetic constraints, the existence of generalized\nbi-Maxwellian asymptotic kinetic equilibria is pointed out. The theory applies\nfor toroidal rotation velocity of the order of the ion thermal speed. These\nsolutions satisfy identically also the constraints imposed by the Maxwell\nequations, i.e. quasi-neutrality and Ampere's law. As a result, it is shown\nthat, in the presence of non-uniform fluid and EM fields, these kinetic\nequilibria can sustain simultaneously toroidal differential rotation,\nquasi-stationary finite poloidal flows and temperature anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 07:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Inverse\nproblems tend to be most useful in, e.g., medical and geophysical imaging, when\nthey combine high contrast with high resolution. In some settings, a single\nmodality displays either high contrast or high resolution but not both. In\nfavorable situations, physical effects couple one modality with high contrast\nwith another modality with high resolution. The mathematical analysis of such\ncouplings forms the class of hybrid inverse problems.\n  Hybrid inverse problems typically involve two steps. In a first step, a\nwell-posed problem involving the high-resolution low-contrast modality is\nsolved from knowledge of boundary measurements. In a second step, a\nquantitative reconstruction of the parameters of interest is performed from\nknowledge of the point-wise, internal, functionals of the parameters\nreconstructed during the first step. This paper reviews mathematical techniques\nthat have been developed in recent years to address the second step.\n  Mathematically, many hybrid inverse problems find interpretations in terms of\nlinear and nonlinear (systems of) equations. In the analysis of such equations,\none often needs to verify that qualitative properties of solutions to elliptic\nlinear equations are satisfied, for instance the absence of any critical\npoints. This paper reviews several methods to prove that such qualitative\nproperties hold, including the method based on the construction of complex\ngeometric optics solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 09:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-24"}

For the space-time manifold (n = 4), these\noperators, connecting the tangent and spinor bundle, are operators that are\nrepresented by the Dirac matrices in the special basis. Reduced connecting\noperators are represented by the Pauli matrices. In order to uniquely prolong\nthe Killing equation from the tangent bundle onto the spinor bundle over the\nspace-time manifold, it is necessary to pass to the complexification of the\nmanifold and the corresponding bundles, and then to pass to the real\nrepresentation. Returning the reverse motion, one can already obtain two copies\nof the spinor bundle. Their set (the pair-spinor) allows to construct the Lie\noperator analogues for the spinors (and the pair-spinors). Similar procedure is\nfeasible for any even n. For n=6, the specified formalism is closely connected\nwith the Bogolyubov-Valatin transformations. For n mod 8=0, being based on the\nBott periodicity, the reduced connecting operators generate the structural\nconstants of an hypercomplex algebra (without division for n> 8) with the\nalternative-elastic, flexible (Jordan), and \"norm\" identities.

The H-alpha emission of solar flare kernels and associated hard X-ray\n(HXR) emission often show similar time variations but their light curves are\nshifted in time by energy transfer mechanisms. We searched for fast radiative\nresponse of the chromosphere in the H-alpha line as a signature of electron\nbeam heating. Methods. We investigate the time differences with sub-second\nresolution between the H-alpha line emission observed with a Multi-channel\nSubtractive Double Pass (MSDP) spectrograph on the Large Coronagraph and\nHorizontal Telescope at Bialkow Observatory, Poland, and HXR emission recorded\nby the RHESSI spacecraft during several flares, greatly extending our earlier\nanalysis (Paper I) to flares between 2003 and 2005. Results. For 16 H-alpha\nflaring kernels, observed in 12 solar flares, we made 72 measurements of time\ndelays between local maxima of the RHESSI X-ray and H-alpha emissions. For most\nkernels, there is an excellent correlation between time variations in the\nH-alpha line emission (at line centre and in the line wings) and HXR (20-50\nkeV) flux, with the H-alpha emission following features in the HXR light curves\ngenerally by a short time lapse delta t = 1-2 s, sometimes significantly longer\n(10-18 s).

Owing to\nour larger number of time measurements than in previous studies, the\ndistribution of delta t values shows a much clearer pattern, with many examples\nof short (1-2 s) delays of the H-alpha emission, but with some flares showing\nlonger (10-18 s) delays.

These ratios are affected by the\nslow neutron-capture process and match the SiC data regarding their 182W/184W,\n183W/184W, and 179Hf/180Hf isotopic compositions, although a small adjustment\nin the s-process production of 183W is needed in order to have a better\nagreement between the SiC data and model predictions. The models cannot explain\nthe 186W/184W ratios observed in the SiC grains, even when the current 185W\nneutron-capture cross section is increased by a factor of two. Further study is\nrequired to better assess how model uncertainties (e.g., the formation of the\n13C neutron source, the mass-loss law, the modelling of the third dredge-up,\nand the efficiency of the 22Ne neutron source) may affect current s-process\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 11:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

SF is also more appropriate than fractional variability and excess\nvariance, because such parameters are biased by the duration of the monitoring\ntime interval in the rest-frame, and thus by cosmological time dilation. We\nfind statistically consistent results for the two samples, with the SF\ndescribed by a power law of the time lag, approximately as SF \\propto tau^0.1.\nWe do not find evidence of the break in the SF, at variance with the case of\nlower luminosity AGNs.

Surprisingly, packing\nfraction is not a good indicator of the ability of the deposit to jam a given\norifice. Different mean avalanche sizes are obtained for deposits with the same\nmean packing fraction that were prepared with very different tap intensities.\nIt has been speculated that the number and size of arches in the bulk of the\ngranular column should be correlated with the ability of the system to jam a\nsmall opening. We show that this correlation, if exists, is rather poor. A\ncomparison between bulk arches and jamming arches (i.e., arches that block the\nopening) reveals that the aperture imposes a lower cut-off on the horizontal\nspan of the arches which is greater than the actual size of the opening.

In contrast, the construction of \\`a la\nBarut-Girardello coherent states for finite-dimensional representations of A(x)\nand A(x,s) can be achieved solely at the price to replace complex variables by\ngeneralized Grassmann (or k-fermionic) variables. Some of the results are\napplied to su(2), su(1,1) and the harmonic oscillator (in a truncated or not\ntruncated form).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 14:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}

We show that these form part of a\nlarger population of transient coorbitals; 129 (94) MBAs undergo episodes of\nco-orbital libration with Ceres (Vesta) within a 2 Myr interval centred on the\npresent. The lifetime in the resonance is typically a few times 10^5 yr butcan\nexceed 2*10^6 yr. The variational properties of the orbits of several\nco-orbitals were examined. It was found that their present states with respect\nto the secondary are well determined but knowledge of it is lost typically\nafter ~2*10^5 years. Objects initially deeper into the coorbital region\nmaintain their coorbital state for longer. Using the model of Namouni et al.\n(1999) we show that their dynamics are similar to those of temporary coorbital\nNEAs of the Earth and Venus. As in that case, the lifetime of resonant\nlibration is dictated by planetary secular perturbations, the inherent\nchaoticity of the orbits and close encounters with massive objects other than\nthe secondary. In particular we present evidence that, while in the coorbital\nstate, close encounters with the secondary are generally avoided and that Ceres\naffects the stability of tadpole librators of Vesta. Finally we demonstrate the\nexistence of Quasi-satellite orbiters of both Ceres and Vesta and conclude that\ndecametre-sized objects detected in the vicinity of Vesta by the DAWN mission\nmay, in fact, belong to this dynamical class rather than be bona-fide (i.e.\nkeplerian) satellites of Vesta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 14:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The pressure and temperature stratification in the\ninterior of the bodies is calculated by solving the equations of hydrostatic\nequilibrium and energy transport.
