The\nthermodynamic path characterizing a macroscopic dynamical behavior can be\nformulated as an infimum of the action functional for the probability\nmeasure-valued process. In our formulation, the second law of thermodynamics\ncan be derived by symmetry of the action functional, which is generated from\nthe fluctuation theorem.

For various reasons, in the context of uncontrollable\nsystems/behaviors, a more appropriate definition of dissipativity is in terms\nof the dissipation inequality, namely the {\\em existence} of a storage\nfunction. A storage function is a function such that along every system\ntrajectory, the rate of increase of the storage function is at most the power\nsupplied.

In our \"early model\" (0.5 s post bounce), the\nnu_e-nu_s MSW effect driven by Delta m^2=2.35 eV^2 is dominated by ordinary\nmatter and leads to a complete nu_e-nu_s swap with little or no trace of\ncollective flavor oscillations. In our \"intermediate\" (2.9 s p.b.) and \"late\nmodels\" (6.5 s p.b.), neutrinos themselves significantly modify the nu_e-nu_s\nmatter effect, and, in particular in the late model, nu-nu refraction strongly\nreduces the matter effect, largely suppressing the overall nu_e-nu_s MSW\nconversion. This phenomenon has not been reported in previous studies of\nactive-sterile supernova neutrino oscillations.

Under $SL(4,\\mathbb{R})$ symmetry group, the\npseudo-Riemannian metric naturally decomposes into a four-volume element and a\nconformal metric; and the affine connection decomposes into a one-form and a\ntrace-free projective connection. In UCPR, these four space-time structures are\ntreated as independent fields that have clear physical interpretations. A\nPalatini-type variational principle for the usual general relativity Lagrangian\nleads to a breakup of the Einstein field equations and the compatibility\nconditions between the metric and connection.

We self-consistently\nbuild up the fuel layer at different rates, spanning the entire range of\nobserved mass accretion rates for superbursters. For all models light curves\nare presented. They generally exhibit a shock breakout, a precursor burst due\nto shock heating, and a two-component power-law decay. Shock heating alone is\nsufficient for a bright precursor, that follows the shock breakout on a short\ndynamical time scale due to the fall-back of expanded layers. Models at the\nhighest accretion rates, however, lack a shock breakout, precursor, and the\nfirst power law decay component. The ashes of the superburst that form the\nouter crust are predominantly composed of iron, but a superburst leaves a\nsilicon-rich layer behind in which the next one ignites. Comparing the model\nlight curves to an observed superburst from 4U 1636-53, we find for our\naccretion composition the best agreement with a model at three times the\nobserved accretion rate. We study the dependence on crustal heating of\nobservables such as the recurrence time and the decay time scale. It remains\ndifficult, however, to constrain crustal heating, if there is no good match\nwith the observed accretion rate, as we see for 4U 1636-53.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Here we\nundertake a critical evaluation of what is currently a popular method for\nprescribing cooling in SPH simulations, i.e. the polytropic cooling due\noriginally to Stamatellos et al. This method uses the local density and\npotential to estimate the column density and optical depth to each particle and\nthen uses these quantities to evaluate an approximate expression for the net\nradiative cooling. We evaluate the algorithm by considering both spherical and\ndisc-like systems with analytic density and temperature structures. In\nspherical systems, the total cooling rate computed by the method is within\naround 20 for the astrophysically relevant case of opacity dominated by ice\ngrains and is correct to within a factor of order unity for a range of opacity\nlaws. In disc geometry, however, the method systematically under-estimates the\ncooling by a large factor at all heights in the disc. For the self-gravitating\ndisc studied, we find that the method under-estimates the total cooling rate by\na factor of 200. This discrepancy may be readily traced to the method's\nsystematic over-estimate of the disc column density and optical depth, since\n(being based only on the local density and potential) it does not take into\naccount the low column density route for photon escape normal to the disc\nplane. These results raise an obvious caution about the method's use in disc\ngeometry whenever an accurate cooling rate is required, although we note that\nthere are situations where the discrepancies highlighted above may not\nsignificantly affect the global outcome of simulations.

The exact diagonalization of the\nspinless AB$_2$ chain is presented in the limiting cases of infinite or zero\nnearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion for any filling. Without interactions, the\nAB$_2$ chain has a flat band even in the presence of magnetic flux. We show\nthat the respective localized states can be written in the most compact form as\nstanding waves in one or two consecutive plaquettes. We show that this result\nis easily generalized to other frustrated lattices such as the Lieb lattice. A\nrestricted Hartree-Fock study of the $V/t$ versus filling phase diagram of the\nAB$_2$ chain has also been carried out. The validity of the mean-field approach\nis discussed taking into account the exact results in the case of infinite\nrepulsion. The ground-state energy as a function of filling and interaction $V$\nis determined using the mean-field approach and exactly for infinite or zero\n$V$.

In this paper we\nanalyze the noise by using active receiving antenna and also propose the\ndetection mechanism based on RF energy duration. The standard back off\nmechanism of 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN) increases the contention window when a\ntransmission failure occurs in order to alleviate contentions in a WLAN. In\naddition, many proposed schemes for 802.11 WLAN behave adaptively to\ntransmission failures. Transmission failures in WLANs occur mostly by two\ncauses: collision and channel noise. However, in 802.11 WLAN, a station cannot\nknow the cause of a transmission failure, thus the adaptive schemes assume the\nideal situation in which all transmission failures occur by only one of two\ncauses. For this reason, they may behave erroneously in a real world where\ntransmission failures occur by both causes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nscheme to detect collision, which utilizes transmission time information and RF\nenergy duration on the channel. By detecting collisions, a station can\ndifferentiate the causes of transmission failures and the adaptive schemes can\noperate correctly by using the detection information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 04:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-12"}

The\nsingularities which arise are known as vertex, edge, and vertex-edge\nsingularities. We propose a nonconforming h-p spectral element method to solve\nthree dimensional elliptic boundary value problems on non-smooth domains to\nexponential accuracy. To overcome the singularities which arise in the\nneighbourhoods of the vertices, vertex-edges and edges we use local systems of\ncoordinates. These local coordinates are modified versions of spherical and\ncylindrical coordinate systems in their respective neighbourhoods. Away from\nthese neighbourhoods standard Cartesian coordinates are used. In each of these\nneighbourhoods we use a geometrical mesh which becomes finer near the corners\nand edges. We then derive differentiability estimates in these new set of\nvariables and a stability estimate on which our method is based for a\nnon-conforming h-p spectral element method. The Sobolev spaces in vertex-edge\nand edge neighbourhoods are anisotropic and become singular at the corners and\nedges.\n  The method is essentially a least-squares collocation} method and a solution\ncan be obtained using Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Method (PCGM). To solve\nthe minimization problem we need to solve the normal equations for the\nleast-squares problem. The residuals in the normal equations can be obtained\nwithout computing and storing mass and stiffness matrices. Computational\nresults for a number of model problems confirm the theoretical estimates\nobtained for the error and computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 10:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-12"}

The compression is represented by straight-line programs (SLPs), i.e.\ncontext-free grammars generating exactly one string. A novel technique of\ndealing with SLPs is introduced: the SLPs are recompressed, so that substrings\nof the input text are encoded in SLPs labelling the transitions of the NFA\n(DFA) in the same way, as in the SLP representing the input text. To this end,\nthe SLPs are locally decompressed and then recompressed in a uniform way.\nFurthermore, such recompression induces only small changes in the automaton, in\nparticular, the size of the automaton remains polynomial.\n  Using this technique it is shown that the compressed membership for NFA with\ncompressed labels is in NP, thus confirming the conjecture of Plandowski and\nRytter and extending the partial result of Lohrey and Mathissen; as it is\nalready known, that this problem is NP-hard, we settle its exact computational\ncomplexity.

We calulate the chemical potential of the impurity, in second\norder perturbation theory and in ladder approximation with a\nBrueckner-Hartree-Fock approach. Moreover, we determine the momentum relaxation\nrate of the impurity, which is related to the \"dipolar\" drag effect. For a\nconfined system we relate the results for the chemical potential with the\nmeasurement of the collective modes of the impurity. The momentum relaxation\nrate provide instead an estimate on how quickly the oscillations are damped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 11:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

The true emission measure\ndistribution, Emd-t(Te), is determined by the energy balance and geometry\nadopted and, with a numerical model, can be used to predict Emd-app(Te), to\nguide further modelling. The scaling laws that exist between coronal parameters\narise from the dimensions of the terms in the energy balance equation. Here,\nanalytical approximations to numerical solutions for Emd-t(Te) are presented,\nwhich show how the constants in the coronal scaling laws are determined. The\napparent emission measure distributions show a minimum value at some\ntemperature (T0) and a maximum at the mean coronal temperature Tc (although in\nsome stars, emission from active regions can contribute).

The SN had a peak\nluminosity, M_R ~ -20.2 mag, significantly more luminous than known GRB-SNe and\none of the most luminous SNe Ib/c ever discovered. The absorption velocity of\nSN 2010ay is v_Si ~ 19,000 km/s at ~40 days after explosion, 2-5 times higher\nthan other broad-lined SNe and similar to the GRB-SN 2010bh at comparable\nepochs. Moreover, the velocity declines ~2 times slower than other SNe Ic-BL\nand GRB-SNe. Assuming that the optical emission is powered by radioactive\ndecay, the peak magnitude implies the synthesis of an unusually large mass of\n56 Ni, M_Ni = 0.9 M_solar. Modeling of the light-curve points to a total ejecta\nmass, M_ej ~ 4.7 M_sol, and total kinetic energy, E_K ~ 11x10^51 ergs. The\nratio of M_Ni to M_ej is ~2 times as large for SN 2010ay as typical GRB-SNe and\nmay suggest an additional energy reservoir. The metallicity (log(O/H)_PP04 + 12\n= 8.19) of the explosion site within the host galaxy places SN 2010ay in the\nlow-metallicity regime populated by GRB-SNe, and ~0.5(0.2) dex lower than that\ntypically measured for the host environments of normal (broad-lined) Ic\nsupernovae. We constrain any gamma-ray emission with E_gamma < 6x10^{48} erg\n(25-150 keV) and our deep radio follow-up observations with the Expanded Very\nLarge Array rule out relativistic ejecta with energy, E > 10^48 erg. We\ntherefore rule out the association of a relativistic outflow like those which\naccompanied SN 1998bw and traditional long-duration GRBs, but place\nless-stringent constraints on a weak afterglow like that seen from XRF 060218.\nThese observations challenge the importance of progenitor metallicity for the\nproduction of a GRB, and suggest that other parameters also play a key role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 13:09:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 18:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 16:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-18"}

According to these equations the spin in\ngeneral relativity is Fermi-transported, and the parallel transport of spin is\nrealized only in some approximation. The traditional general-relativistic Dirac\nequation (1929) is based on the parallel transported spinors and does not\nensure the correspondent transition. Second, because in the range of very high\nvelocity (close to the speed of light) of a spinning particle relative to the\nSchwarzschild or Kerr sources the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations have the\nsolutions which reveal that the spin-gravity interaction acts as a strong\nantigravity force, we suppose that this fact can be useful for explanation some\nastrophysical phenomena.

The problem has applications ranging from modeling pairwise\ncomparisons to reconstructing mental processing architectures to conjoint\ntesting.

Firstly a dispersion relation valid in this\nregime is derived which provides a unified description of drift-tearing modes,\nkinetic Alfven waves and the internal kink mode at low beta. Tearing mode\nstability is investigated analytically recovering the stabilising ion orbit\neffect, obtained previously by Cowley et al. [Phys. Fluids (29) 3230 1986],\nwhich implies large values of the tearing mode stability parameter \"Delta\nprime\" are required for instability. Secondly, at high beta it is shown that\nthe tearing mode interacts with the kinetic Alfven wave and that there is an\nabsolute stabilisation for all \"Delta prime\" due to the shielding effects of\nthe electron temperature gradients, extending the result of Drake et. al [Phys.\nFluids (26) 2509 1983] to large ion orbits. The nature of the transition\nbetween these two limits at finite values of beta is then elucidated. The low\nbeta formalism is also relevant to the m=n=1 tearing mode and the dissipative\ninternal kink mode, thus extending the work of Pegoraro et al. [Phys. Fluids B\n(1) 364 1989] to a more realistic electron model incorporating temperature\nperturbations, but then the smallness of the dissipative internal kink mode\nfrequency is exploited to obtain a new dispersion relation valid at arbitrary\nbeta. A diagram describing the stability of both the tearing mode and\ndissipative internal kink mode, in the space of \"Delta prime\" and beta, is\nobtained. The trajectory of the evolution of the current profile during a\nsawtooth period can be plotted in this diagram, providing a model for the\ntriggering of a sawtooth crash.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 15:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 10:08:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2012 12:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

Local finiteness implies a kind of common knowledge of a\ncountable number of points. Unfortunately its relationship to other forms of\ncommon knowledge is complex. In the context of the multi-agent propositional\ncalculus, if the set of formulas held in common knowledge is generated by a\nfinite set of formulas but a finite structure is not determined then there are\nuncountably many locally finite structures sharing this same set of formulas in\ncommon knowledge and likewise uncountably many with uncountable size. This\ndiffers radically from the infinite generation of formulas in common knowledge,\nand we show some examples of this. One corollary is that if there are\ninfinitely many distinct points but a uniform bound on the number of points any\nplayer knows is possible then the set of formulas in common knowledge cannot be\nfinitely generated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 07:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-17"}
