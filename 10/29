More\nspecifically, a weak backdoor set of F is a set X of variables such that there\nexits a truth assignment t to X that reduces F to a satisfiable formula F[t]\nthat belongs to a polynomial-time decidable base class C. A strong backdoor set\nis a set X of variables such that for all assignments t to X, the reduced\nformula F[t] belongs to C.\n  We study the problem of finding backdoor sets of size at most k with respect\nto the base class of CNF formulas with acyclic incidence graphs, taking k as\nthe parameter. We show that\n  1. the detection of weak backdoor sets is W[2]-hard in general but\nfixed-parameter tractable for r-CNF formulas, for any fixed r>=3, and\n  2. the detection of strong backdoor sets is fixed-parameter approximable.\n  Result 1 is the the first positive one for a base class that does not have a\ncharacterization with obstructions of bounded size. Result 2 is the first\npositive one for a base class for which strong backdoor sets are more powerful\nthan deletion backdoor sets.\n  Not only SAT, but also #SAT can be solved in polynomial time for CNF formulas\nwith acyclic incidence graphs.

The measurement was based on the assumption that the pulse shape of the\nneutrinos from the decay of parent mesons produced in proton-target collisions\nis the same as that of the incident protons. Here we argue that the effective\ncolumn density of the target along the beam direction decreases with time\nduring the 10.5 microseconds duration of the proton pulse. This is because of\nthe thermal expansion and expulsion of target material along the beam by the\nenergy-momentum deposition during the 10.5 microseconds pulse. The progresive\nreduction in the effective column density during the pulse decreases the\nneutrino production rate per incident proton. It could have advanced the mean\nproduction time of the detected neutrinos relative to that calculated from the\nproton pulse-shape, by an amount comparable to the measured neutrino lead time\n(60.7+/-6.9(stat) +/-7.4(sys) ns. This explanation implies that the planned\nmeasurements by OPERA of the speed of neutrinos produced in much shorter (a few\nns) pulses, should yield a speed consistent with the speed of light in free\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 17:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-31"}

Planetesimal growth can\nbe prevented by catastrophic disruption in pre-planetesimal collisions above\nthe destruction velocity threshold. We develop an inhomogeneity model based on\nthe density distribution of dust aggregates, which is assumed to be a Gaussian\ndistribution with a well-defined standard deviation. As a second input\nparameter, we consider the typical size of an inhomogeneous clump. These input\nparameters are easily accessible by laboratory experiments. For the simulation\nof the dust aggregates, we utilise a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code\nwith extensions for modelling porous solid bodies.

To circumvent this problem, information gap (info-gap)\ntheory has been developed to explicitly recognize and quantify the implications\nof information gaps in decision making.

The\nanalysis provides decision support in determining the fraction of contaminant\nmass to remove from the environment in the presence of a lack of information\nrelated to the contaminant mass flux into an aquifer.

We study this crossover theoretically by employing the periodic\nAnderson model within the framework of the dynamical mean field theory. Changes\noccurring in the dynamics and transport across this crossover are highlighted.\nAs the valence is decreased (increased) relative to the Kondo lattice regime,\nthe Kondo resonance broadens significantly, while the lower (upper) Hubbard\nband moves closer to the Fermi level. The resistivity develops a two peak\nstructure in the mixed valent regime: a low temperature coherence peak and a\nhigh temperature 'Hubbard band' peak. These two peaks merge yielding a broad\nshallow maximum upon decreasing the valence further. The optical conductivity,\nlikewise exhibits an unusual absorption feature (shoulder) in the deep\nmid-infrared region, which grows in intensity with decreasing valence. The\ninvolvement of the Hubbard bands in dc transport, and of the effective f-level\nin the optical conductivity are shown to be responsible for the anomalous\ntransport properties. A two-band hybridization-gap model, which neglects\nincoherent effects due to many-body scattering, commonly employed to understand\nthe optical response in these materials is shown to be inadequate, especially\nin the mixed-valent regime.

There is a special case of the problem, called the carpenter problem,\nwhich can be stated as follows: for a masa A in a finite factor M with\nconditional expectation E_A, can each x in A with 0 <= x <= 1 be expressed as\nE_A(p) for a projection p in M?\n  In this paper, we investigate these problems for various masas. We give\npositive solutions for the generator and radial masas in free group factors,\nand we also solve affirmatively a weaker form of the Schur-Horm problem for the\nCartan masa in the hyperfinite factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2011 05:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-01"}

According to the\ndefinitions of the spectral states in Remillard & McClintock (2006), most of\nthe observations have been classified into the intermediate state. All the\nX-ray broadband spectra can be modeled by a multi-color disk plus a power-law\nwith an exponential cutoff or a multi-color disk plus a Comptonization\ncomponent. During the initial phase of the outburst, a high energy cutoff was\nvisible at 30-40 keV. The innermost radius of the disk gradually decreased by a\nfactor of more than 3 from the onset of the outburst and reached a constant\nvalue of 35 d_10 cos i^-1/2 km, where d_10 is the distance in units of 10 kpc\nand $i$ is the inclination. The type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO)\nfrequency varied from 1.6 Hz to 7.3 Hz in association with a change of the\ninnermost radius, while the innermost radius remained constant during the\ntype-B QPO detections at 1.6-4.1 Hz.
