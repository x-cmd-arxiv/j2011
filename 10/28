The\noriginal Linial-Nisan Conjecture was recently proved by Braverman; we offered a\n$200 prize for the generalized version. In this paper, we save ourselves $200\nby showing that the GLN Conjecture is false, at least for circuits of depth 3\nand higher. As a byproduct, our counterexample also implies that Pi2P is not\ncontained in P^NP relative to a random oracle with probability 1. It has been\nconjectured since the 1980s that PH is infinite relative to a random oracle,\nbut the highest levels of PH previously proved separate were NP and coNP.\nFinally, our counterexample implies that the famous results of Linial, Mansour,\nand Nisan, on the structure of AC0 functions, cannot be improved in several\ninteresting respects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 16:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-28"}

Early constructions using a Ramsey-based\nargument have been supplanted by rank-based constructions with exponentially\nbetter bounds. In 2001 Lee et al. presented the size-change termination (SCT)\nproblem, along with both a reduction to B\\\"uchi automata and a Ramsey-based\nalgorithm. The Ramsey-based algorithm was presented as a more practical\nalternative to the automata-theoretic approach, but strongly resembles the\ninitial complementation constructions for B\\\"uchi automata. We prove that the\nSCT algorithm is a specialized realization of the Ramsey-based complementation\nconstruction. To do so, we extend the Ramsey-based complementation construction\nto provide a containment-testing algorithm. Surprisingly, empirical analysis\nsuggests that despite the massive gap in worst-case complexity, Ramsey-based\napproaches are superior over the domain of SCT problems. Upon further analysis\nwe discover an interesting property of the problem space that both explains\nthis result and provides a chance to improve rank-based tools.

If the first stars are powered by dark matter\nheating in triaxial dark matter haloes, they may grow to be very large and very\nbright, visible in deep imaging with JWST and even Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST). We use HST surveys to place bounds on the numbers of SMDSs that may be\ndetected in future JWST imaging surveys. We showed that SMDS in the mass range\n$10^6-10^7 M_\\odot$ are bright enough to be detected in all the wavelength\nbands of the NIRCam on JWST . If SMDSs exist at z ~10, 12, and 14, they will be\ndetectable as J-band, H-band, or K-band dropouts, respectively. With a total\nsurvey area of 150 arcmin^2 (assuming a multi-year deep parallel survey with\nJWST), we find that typically the number of $10^6 M_\\odot$ SMDSs found as H or\nK-band dropouts is ~10^5\\fsmds, where the fraction of early DM haloes hosting\nDS is likely to be small, \\fsmds<<1. If the SDMS survive down to z=10 where HST\nbounds apply, then the observable number of SMDSs as H or K-band dropouts with\nJWST is ~1-30. While individual SMDS are bright enough to be detected by JWST,\nstandard PopIII stars are not, and would only be detected in first galaxies\nwith total stellar masses of ~$10^6-10^8 M_\\odot$. Differentiating first\ngalaxies at z>10 from SMDSs would be possible with spectroscopy: the SMDS\n(which are too cool produce significant nebular emission) will have only\nabsorption lines while the galaxies are likely to produce emission lines as\nwell. Of particular interest would be the 1640 HeII emission line as well as\nH{\\alpha} lines which would be signatures of early galaxies rather than SMDSs.\nThe detection of SMDSs would not only provide alternative evidence for WIMPs\nbut would also provide possible seeds for the formation of supermassive black\nholes that power QSOs at z~6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 21:49:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 17:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

We find that ~70% of the influx into the virial radius Rv is in narrow\nstreams covering 10% of the virial shell. On average 64% of the stream influx\nis in one stream, and 95% is in three dominant streams. The streams that feed a\nmassive halo tend to lie in a plane that extends from half to a few Rv,\nhereafter \"the stream plane\" (SP).

The filaments-in-a-plane configuration about the massive haloes\nat the nodes of the cosmic web differs from the large- scale structure of the\nweb where the filaments mark the intersections of slanted sheets. The stream\nplane is only weakly aligned with the angular momentum (AM) near Rv, consistent\nwith the fact that typically 80% of the AM is carried by one dominant stream.\nThe galactic disc plane shows a weak tendency to be perpendicular to the\nlarge-scale SP, consistent with tidal-torque theory.

The authors proposed the graph score function {\\em\nrumor centrality} as an estimator for detecting the source.

Along with previous results by the author during the last\ndecade, this work contains also some new developments of DTd. Based on the\nOnsager's constitutive equations, reformulated by the author thermodynamic\naffinity and reaction extent, and Le Chatelier's principle, DTd brings forward\na notion of chemical equilibrium as a balance of internal and external\nthermodynamic forces (TdF), acting against a chemical system. Basic expression\nof DTd is the chemical system logistic map of thermodynamic states that ties\ntogether energetic characteristics of chemical reaction, occurring in the\nsystem, the system shift from \"true\" thermodynamic equilibrium (TdE), and\ncausing that shift external thermodynamic forces. Solutions to the basic map\nare pitchfork bifurcation diagrams in coordinates \"shift from TdE - growth\nfactor (or TdF)\"; points, corresponding to the system thermodynamic states, are\ndwelling on its branches. The diagrams feature three typical areas: true\nthermodynamic equilibrium and open equilibrium along the thermodynamic branch\nbefore the threshold of its stability, i.e. bifurcation point, and bifurcation\narea with bistability and chaotic oscillations after the point. The set of\nsolutions makes up the chemical system domain of states. The new paradigm\ncomplies with the correspondence principle: in isolated chemical system\nexternal TdF vanish, and the basic map turns into traditional expression of\nchemical equilibrium via thermodynamic affinity. The theory binds together\nclassical and contemporary thermodynamics of chemical equilibria on a unique\nconceptual basis.

Since the anomalous\npeak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass\nenergy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly\n0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering\nexperiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very\ndifferent from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on\nopposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic\nscattering. We investigated effects of such variations in the strange-quark\ndistribution s(x) on the anomaly. We found that distributions of W+dijets and\nother process are affected by the strange-quark modifications in wide\ndijet-mass regions including the 140 GeV one. Since the CDF anomaly was\nobserved in the shoulder region of the dijet-mass distribution, a slight\nmodification of the distribution shape could explain at least partially the CDF\nexcess. Therefore, it is important to consider such effects within the standard\nmodel for judging whether the CDF anomaly indicates new physics beyond the\nstandard model.

The changes in conformation are often attributable\nto a small fraction of residues within the protein. Therefore identification of\nthese variable regions is important for an understanding of protein function.\n  Results: We propose a novel method for identification of local conformational\nchanges in proteins. In our method, backbone conformations are encoded into a\nsequence of letters from a 16-letter alphabet (called D2 codes) to perform\nstructural comparison. Since we do not use clustering analysis to encode local\nstructures, the D2 codes not only provides a intuitively understandable\ndescription of protein structures, but also covers wide varieties of\ndistortions. This paper shows that the D2 codes are better correlated with\nchanges in the dihedral angles than a structural alphabet and a secondary\nstructure description. In the case of the N37S mutant of HIV-1 protease, local\nconformational changes were captured by the D2 coding method more accurately\nthan other methods. The D2 coding also provided a reliable representation of\nthe difference between NMR models of an HIV-1 protease mutant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 04:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-31"}

Our results give a direction of the\nvelocity vector in agreement with the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation\n(CMBR) value, but the magnitude ($\\sim 1600\\pm 400$ km/s) is $\\sim 4$ times the\nCMBR value ($369\\pm 1$ km/s) at a statistically significant ($\\sim 3\\sigma$)\nlevel. A genuine difference between the two dipoles would imply anisotropic\nUniverse, with the anisotropy changing with the epoch. This would violate the\ncosmological principle where the isotropy of the Universe is assumed for all\nepochs, and on which the whole modern cosmology is based upon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 06:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

For more than 50 years the\ndefinition of the Galactic coordinate system has remained unchanged from this\nIAU1958 version. On the basis of deep and all-sky catalogs, the position of the\nGalactic plane can be revised and updated definitions of the Galactic\ncoordinate systems can be proposed. We re-determine the position of the\nGalactic plane based on modern large catalogs, such as the Two Micron All-Sky\nSurvey (2MASS) and the SPECFIND v2.0. This paper also aims to propose a\npossible definition of the optimal Galactic coordinate system by adopting the\nICRS position of the Sgr A* at the Galactic center. The near-infrared 2MASS\npoint source catalog and the SPECFIND v2.0 catalog of radio continuum spectra\nare used to determine the mean position of the Galactic plane on the celestial\nsphere. By fitting the data to an ideal Galactic equator, the parameters\ndefining the Galactic coordinate system are obtained. We find that the\nobliquity of the Galactic equator on the ICRS principal plane is about\n$0.4^\\circ$ (2MASS) and $0.6^\\circ$ (SPECFIND v2.0) larger than the J2000.0\nvalue, which is widely used in coordinate transformations between the\nequatorial $(\\alpha, \\delta)$ and the Galactic $(\\ell, b)$. Depending on the\nadopted parameters, data, and methods, the largest difference between the\nresulting Galactic coordinate systems is several arcminutes. We derive revised\ntransformation matrices and parameters describing the orientation of the\nGalactic coordinate systems in the ICRS at the 1 milli-arcsecond level to match\nthe precision of modern observations. For practical applications, we propose\nthat a revised definition of the Galactic coordinate system should be required\nin the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 07:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Science results\nto date and expected for the coming mission years span a wide range of\nhigh-energy astrophysics, including studies of the distribution of positrons in\nthe Galaxy; reflection of gamma-rays off clouds in the interstellar medium near\nthe Galactic Centre; studies of black holes and neutron stars particularly in\nhigh- mass systems; gamma-ray polarization measurements for X-ray binaries and\ngamma-ray bursts, and sensitive detection capabilities for obscured active\ngalaxies with more than 1000 expected to be found until 2014. This paper\nsummarizes scientific highlights obtained since INTEGRAL's launch in 2002, and\noutlines prospects for the INTEGRAL mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 08:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-31"}

We analysed the light\ncurves of 1028 chemically peculiar stars obtained with the STEREO spacecraft.\nWe present here the results obtained for the 337 magnetic chemically peculiar\nstars in our sample. Thanks to the cadence and stability of the photometry,\nSTEREO data are perfectly suitable to study variability signals with a\nperiodicity typical of magnetic chemically peculiar stars.

For each star we classified as variable, we determined temperature,\nluminosity, mass and fractional age, but the limited statistics, biased towards\nthe shorter periods, prevented us from finding any evolutionary trend of the\nrotational period.

We find that the\nplanet's adiabatic mass-radius relation and its ability to open a deep gap in\nthe disc determine whether the disruption proceeds as a sudden runaway or a\nbalanced quasi-static process. In the latter case the planet feeds the inner\ndisc through its Lagrangian L1 point like a secondary star in a stellar binary\nsystem. As the planet loses mass it gains specific angular momentum and\nnormally migrates in the outward direction until the gap closes. Numerical\nexperiments show that planet disruption outbursts are preceded by long\n\"quiescent\" periods during which the disc inward of the planet is empty. The\nhole in the disc is created when the planet opens a deep gap, letting the inner\ndisc to drain onto the star while keeping the outer one stalled behind the\nplanet.

In a\nsubset of parameter space, there is a limit cycle behaviour caused by\nnon-linear interaction between the planet mass loss and the disc hydrogen\nionisation instability.

We show that the comparison of QD and CC\nand of their derivatives in the direct and reciprocal lattice allows one to\nefficiently inspect the structure of two-point driven quantum phase transitions\n(QPTs), discriminating those at which off diagonal long range order (ODLRO) is\ninvolved. Moreover we observe that QD between pair of sites is a monotonic\nfunction of ODLRO, thus establishing a direct relation between the latter and\ntwo point quantum correlations different from the entanglement. The study of\nthe ground state properties allows to show that for a whole class of\npermutation invariant (\\eta-pair) states quantum discord can violate the\nmonogamy property, both in presence and in absence of bipartite entanglement.\nIn the thermodynamic limit, due to the presence of ODLRO, the violation for\n\\eta-pair states is maximal, while for the purely fermionic ground state is\nfinite. From a general perspective, all our results validate the importance of\nthe concepts of QD and CC for the study of critical condensed-matter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 15:58:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 09:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

For two parameters, the solar minimum (Rmin) and\nrising rate ({\\beta}a), which can be directly measured a few months after the\nminimum, a synthesis degree of similarity ({\\eta}s) is defined as the\nweighted-average of the {\\eta} values around Rmin and {\\beta}a with the weights\ngiven by the coefficients of determination of Rmax with Rmin and {\\beta}a,\nrespectively. The monthly values of the whole referenced cycle can be predicted\nby averaging the corresponding values in the most similar cycles with the\nweights given by the {\\eta}s values. Cycles 14 and 10 are found to be the two\nmost similar cycles of Cycle 24. As an application, Cycle 24 is predicted to\npeak around January 2013{\\pm}8 (months) with a size of about Rmax\n=83.0{\\pm}16.7 and to end around September 2019.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 05:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It creates an anthropic decision theory (ADT) that\ndecides these problems from a small set of principles. By doing so, it\ndemonstrates that the attitude of agents with regards to each other (selfish or\naltruistic) changes the decisions they reach, and that it is very important to\ntake this into account. To illustrate ADT, it is then applied to two major\nanthropic problems and paradoxes, the Presumptuous Philosopher and Doomsday\nproblems, thus resolving some issues about the probability of human extinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 13:34:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 13:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 15:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}
