Several methods were employed to extract the strength of\nthe signal: the event-plane, cumulant and Lee-Yang Zeros methods. These methods\nhave different sensitivity to correlations that are not caused by the\ncollective motion in the system (non-flow correlations due to jets, resonance\ndecays, and quantum correlations). The second Fourier coefficient of the\ncharged hadron azimuthal distributions was measured as a function of transverse\nmomentum, pseudorapidity and centrality in a broad kinematic range: $0.3 < p_T\n< 12.0$ GeV/c, $|\\eta| < 2.4$, as a function of collision centrality.

The Monte Carlo simulations are also a\nmethod for performing those detailed studies of the APS contributions of single\nsource populations, which are required in order to identify the actual IGRB\ncontributors. We present preliminary results of an anisotropy search in the\nIGRB. At angular scales <2deg (e.g. above multipole 155), angular power above\nthe photon noise level is detected, at energies between 1 and 10 GeV in each\nenergy bin, with statistical significance between 7.2 and 4.1 sigmas. The\nenergy not dependence of the fluctuation anisotropy is pointing to the presence\nof one or more unclustered source populations, while the energy dependence of\nthe intensity anisotropy is consistent with source populations having average\nphoton index 2.40\\pm0.07.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 17:13:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 14:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

A very important measure in\nQuantum Information Theory, the Entanglement of Formation (EOF), fails to\nsatisfy this last requirement. Here we present the reasons for that and show a\nset of conditions that an arbitrary pure tripartite state must satisfy for EOF\nto become a monogamous measure, ie, for \\tau_{ABC} \\ge 0.

For example, \\maxcut\nis a boolean CSP where the input is a graph $G = (V,E)$ and the goal is to find\na cut $S \\cup \\bar S = V$ that maximizes the numberof crossing edges,\n$|E(S,\\bar S)|$. The \\maxbisection problem is a variant of \\maxcut with an\nadditional global constraint that each side of the cut has exactly half the\nvertices, i.e., $|S| = |V|/2$. Several other natural optimization problems like\n\\minbisection and approximating Graph Expansion can be formulated as CSPs with\nglobal constraints.\n  In this work, we formulate a general approach towards approximating CSPs with\nglobal constraints using SDP hierarchies. To demonstrate the approach we\npresent the following results:\n  Using the Lasserre hierarchy, we present an algorithm that runs in time\n$O(n^{poly(1/\\epsilon)})$ that given an instance of \\maxbisection with value\n$1-\\epsilon$, finds a bisection with value $1-O(\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$. This\napproximation is near-optimal (up to constant factors in $O()$) under the\nUnique Games Conjecture.\n  By a computer-assisted proof, we show that the same algorithm also achieves a\n0.85-approximation for \\maxbisection, improving on the previous bound of 0.70\n(note that it is \\uniquegames hard to approximate better than a 0.878 factor).\nThe same algorithm also yields a 0.92-approximation for \\maxtwosat with\ncardinality constraints.\n  For every CSP with a global cardinality constraints, we present a generic\nconversion from integrality gap instances for the Lasserre hierarchy to a {\\it\ndictatorship test} whose soundness is at most integrality gap.

Letting VC_opt(G) denote the minimum size of vertex\ncover in G, the algorithm outputs, with high constant success probability, an\nestimate VC_estimate(G) such that VC_opt(G) <= VC_estimate(G) <= 2 * VC_opt(G)\n+ epsilon*n, where epsilon is a given additive approximation parameter.

In this paper, we address these questions from\nthe perspective of the recently developed conditional states formalism for\nquantum theory [arXiv:1107.5849]. Specifically, we derive a compatibility\ncriterion proposed by Brun, Finkelstein and Mermin from the requirement that,\nupon acquiring data, agents should update their states using a quantum\ngeneralization of Bayesian conditioning.

We present a\nsuite of simulations aimed at understanding how different observational choices\nrelated to the properties of a low luminosity system impact our ability to\ndetermine its true structural parameters such as half-light radius and central\nsurface brightness. We focus on estimating half-light radii (on which mass\nestimates depend linearly) and find that these numbers can have up to 100%\nuncertainties when relatively shallow photometric surveys, such as SDSS, are\nused. Our simulations suggest that to recover structural parameters within 10%\nor better of their true values: (a) the ratio of the field-of-view to the\nhalf-light radius of the satellite must be greater than three, (b) the total\nnumber of stars, including background objects should be larger than 1000, and\n(c) the central to background stellar density ratio must be higher than 20.

In liquid He II, a two-fluid model for mass flow is used to\nextract the superfluid velocity in the nanohole for different pressure heads at\ntemperatures close to the superfluid transition. These velocities compare well\nto existing data for the critical superflow of liquid helium in other confined\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-18"}

We\nfind that the radiation hydrodynamical/sink particle simulation reproduces many\nobserved stellar properties very well. In particular, whereas using a\nbarotropic equation of state produces more brown dwarfs than stars, the\ninclusion of radiative feedback results in a stellar mass function and a ratio\nof brown dwarfs to stars in good agreement with observations of Galactic\nstar-forming regions. In addition, many of the other statistical properties of\nthe stars and brown dwarfs are in reasonable agreement with observations,\nincluding multiplicity as a function of primary mass, the frequency of\nvery-low-mass binaries, and general trends for the mass ratio and separation\ndistributions of binaries. We also examine the velocity dispersion of the\nstars, the distributions of disc truncation radii due to dynamical\ninteractions, and coplanarity of orbits and sink particle spins in multiple\nsystems.

The flow separates at the dune\ncrest and reattaches downstream on the bed (at x=5.7h). A favorable pressure\ngradient accelerates the flow over the stoss-side (the upward-sloping region\nfor x > 8h) and an unfavorable gradient for x < 8h decelerates the flow over\nthe lee-side of the dune. Due to the separation of the flow, a shear layer is\ngenerated after the crest that expands in the wake region towards the next\ndune. The outer-layer turbulence structures are visualized through isosurfaces\nof pressure fluctuations colored by distance to the surface. Spanwise vortices\nare generated in the shear layer separating from the crest due to the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability.

The interaction between two large coherent structures may result in\nmerging, or in dissipation of the weaker one. Surviving eddies grow and rise\nalong the shear layer emanating from the dune crest; they tilt downward and,\neventually, their tips touch the surface.

Here\nwe model the radio-microwave emission as synchrotron radiation produced by the\nshock interaction between the jet and the gaseous circumnuclear medium (CNM).\nAt early times after the onset of the jet (t < 5-10 days) a reverse shock\npropagates through and decelerates the ejecta, while at later times the outflow\napproaches the Blandford-McKee self-similar evolution (possibly modified by\nadditional late energy injection). The achromatic break in the radio light\ncurve of J1644+57 is naturally explained as the transition between these\nphases. We show that the temporal indices of the pre- and post-break light\ncurve are consistent with those predicted if the CNM has a wind-type radial\ndensity profile n ~ 1/r^2. The observed synchrotron frequencies and\nself-absorbed flux constrain the fraction of the post-shock thermal energy in\nrelativistic electrons epsilon_e ~ 0.03-0.1; the CNM density at 1e18 cm ~ 1-10\n1/cm^3; and the initial Lorentz factor Gamma_j ~ 10-20 and opening angle\ntheta_j ~ (0.1-1)Gamma_j^(-1) ~ 0.01-0.1 of the jet. Radio modeling thus\nprovides robust independent evidence for a narrowly collimated outflow.\nExtending our model to the future evolution of J1644+57, we predict that the\nradio flux at low frequencies (<~ few GHz) will begin to brighten more rapidly\nonce the characteristic frequency crosses below the self-absorption frequency\non a timescale of months (indeed, such a transition may already have begun).\nOur results demonstrate that relativistic outflows from tidal disruption events\nprovide a unique probe of the conditions in distant, previously inactive\ngalactic nuclei, complementing studies of normal AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 21:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 21:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

While there is plenty of click data for popular\nqueries, very little information is available for unpopular tail ones.

Murty, Graph Theory\nwith Applications (Macmillan, New York, 1976), p.247, Problem 11).\n  Given a graph $H$, what is the maximum number of edges of a graph with $n$\nvertices not containing $H$ as a subgraph? This number is denoted $ex(n,H)$,\nand is known as the Turan number. P. Erdos conjectured that there exists a\npositive constant $c$ such that $ex(n,C_{2k})\\geq cn^{1+1/k}$(see P. Erdos,\nSome unsolved problems in graph theory and combinatorial analysis,\nCombinatorial Mathematics and its Applications (Proc. Conf., Oxford, 1969), pp.\n97--109, Academic Press, London, 1971). This paper summarizes some results on\nthese problems and the conjectures that relate to these.

These atypical stellar morphologies allow for\nrigorous tests of star formation models that examine the effects on star\nformation of the HI, stellar and dark matter mass components, as well as the\nkinematics of the gaseous and stellar disks. We use far ultra-violet and 24\nmicron imaging from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Spitzer Infrared\nNearby Galaxies Survey respectively to map the spatial distribution of the\ntotal star formation rate surface density within each galaxy. New\nhigh-resolution HI line observations obtained with the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array are used to study the distribution and dynamics of each galaxy's\nneutral inter-stellar medium.

In this model, a\nsettling subsonic accretion proceeds through a hot shell formed around the NS\nmagnetosphere. The accretion rate onto the NS is determined by the ability of\nthe plasma to enter the magnetosphere.Due to large Reynolds numbers in the\nshell, the interaction of the rotating magnetosphere with plasma initiates a\nsubsonic turbulence. The convective motions are capable of carrying the angular\nmomentum through the shell.

Furthermore, the results obtained here\ncorrect Feynman's analysis of this subject. A formalism is thus developed that\nallows the description of states with non-zero momentum, which is then applied\nto the OPERA and ICARUS neutrino-speed experiments. For OPERA we choose a mass\nin the nano electron-volt range and find that although our formalism predicts a\nnon-zero detection probability for an early arrival time of 60 ns, the\npredicted event distribution is maximal on the light-cone. Consequently, our\nprediction does not reproduce the peak at 60 ns reported by the OPERA\ncollaboration. Turning to the ICARUS experiment, we note that while the\ncollaboration reported an average time of flight that is consistent with the\nspeed of light, the event data with its associated uncertainties nevertheless\nindicates that some of the detection events are separated from their\ncorresponding emission events by a space-like interval. For a micro\nelectron-volt mass range, this is in agreement with the here reported\nformalism. We thus raise the possibility of employing high-precision\nneutrino-speed experiments to determine the absolute masses of neutrino mass\neigenstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 07:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 03:11:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 01:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

A new four-telescope interferometric instrument called PIONIER has\nrecently been installed at VLTI. It provides improved imaging capabilities\ntogether with high precision. Aims. We search for low-mass companions around a\nfew bright stars using different strategies, and determine the dynamic range\ncurrently reachable with PIONIER. Methods. Our method is based on the closure\nphase, which is the most robust interferometric quantity when searching for\nfaint companions. We computed the chi^2 goodness of fit for a series of binary\nstar models at different positions and with various flux ratios. The resulting\nchi^2 cube was used to identify the best-fit binary model and evaluate its\nsignificance, or to determine upper limits on the companion flux in case of non\ndetections. Results. No companion is found around Fomalhaut, tau Cet and\nRegulus. The median upper limits at 3 sigma on the companion flux ratio are\nrespectively of 2.3e-3 (in 4 h), 3.5e-3 (in 3 h) and 5.4e-3 (in 1.5 h) on the\nsearch region extending from 5 to 100 mas. Our observations confirm that the\npreviously detected near-infrared excess emissions around Fomalhaut and tau Cet\nare not related to a low-mass companion, and instead come from an extended\nsource such as an exozodiacal disk. In the case of del Aqr, in 30 min of\nobservation, we obtain the first direct detection of a previously known\ncompanion, at an angular distance of about 40 mas and with a flux ratio of\n2.05e-2 \\pm 0.16e-2. Due to the limited u,v plane coverage, its position can,\nhowever, not be unambiguously determined. Conclusions. After only a few months\nof operation, PIONIER has already achieved one of the best dynamic ranges\nworld-wide for multi-aperture interferometers. A dynamic range up to about\n1:500 is demonstrated, but significant improvements are still required to reach\nthe ultimate goal of directly detecting hot giant extrasolar planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 08:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The cold dark matter\ncosmological model predicts that a large number of substructures should survive\ninside larger halos but, surprisingly, this population alone has been shown to\nbe insufficient to explain the observed distribution of the flux ratios of\nquasar's multiple images. Other halos (and their own subhalos) projected along\nthe line of sight to the primary lens have been considered as additional source\nof perturbation. In this work, we use ray tracing through the Millennium II\nsimulation to investigate the importance of projection effects due to halos and\nsubhalos of mass m>1E8 Msun/h and extend our analysis to lower masses, m>1E6\nMsun/h, using Monte-Carlo halo distributions. We find that the magnitude of the\nviolation depends strongly on the density profile and concentration of the\nintervening halos, but clustering plays only a minor role. For a typical\nlensing geometry (lens at redshift 0.6 and source at redshift 2), background\nhaloes (behind the main lens) are more likely to cause a violation than\nforeground halos. We conclude that line-of-sight structures can be as important\nas intrinsic substructures in causing flux-ratio anomalies. The combined effect\nof perturbing structures within the lens and along the line of sight in the\nLCDM universe results in a cusp-violation probability of 20-30%. This\nalleviates the discrepancy between models and current data, but a larger\nobservational sample is required for a stronger test of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 08:46:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 09:56:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 12:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

For example, the user is made to\nsign within a small box, in order to limit their signature to a predefined set\nof dimensions, thus eliminating scaling. Moreover, the angular rotation with\nrespect to the referenced signature that will be inadvertently introduced as\nhuman error, hampers performance of biometric signature verification systems.\nTo eliminate this, traditionally, a user is asked to sign exactly on top of a\nreference line.

It is strictly less expressive than data automata and the expressive\npower is incomparable with register automata. The expressive power of weak data\nautomata corresponds exactly to existential monadic second order logic with\nsuccessor +1 and data value equality \\sim, EMSO2(+1,\\sim). It follows from\nprevious work, David, et. al. in 2010, that the nonemptiness problem for weak\ndata automata can be decided in 2-NEXPTIME. Furthermore, we study weak B\\\"uchi\nautomata on data omega-strings. They can be characterized by the extension of\nEMSO2(+1,\\sim) with existential quantifiers for infinite sets.

We then review parametric excitation measurements, an\nalternative actuation method which is based on nonlinear dynamics.

A detailed\nrenormalization-group (RG) study of the critical Casimir forces induced between\nthe film's boundary planes by thermal fluctuations is presented for the case\nwhere the O(n) symmetry remains unbroken by the surfaces. The boundary planes\nare assumed to cause short-ranged disturbances of the interactions that can be\nmodelled by standard surface contributions $\\propto \\bm{\\phi}^2$ corresponding\nto subcritical or critical enhancement of the surface interactions. This\ntranslates into mesoscopic boundary conditions of the generic\nsymmetry-preserving Robin type $\\partial_n\\bm{\\phi}=\\mathring{c}_j\\bm{\\phi}$.\nRG-improved perturbation theory and Abel-Plana techniques are used to compute\nthe $L$-dependent part $f_{\\mathrm{res}}$ of the reduced excess free energy per\nfilm area $A\\to\\infty $ to two-loop order.

We have rigorously propagated the\nobservational errors (noise and calibration) through the entire fitting\nprocess, in order to derive consistent parameter uncertainties.\n  Results: First, we show that using the integrated SED leads to\nunderestimating the dust mass by ~50 % compared to the value obtained with\nsufficient spatial resolution, for the region we studied.

Second, we show that Milky Way type\ngrains produce higher gas-to-dust mass ratios than what seems possible\naccording to the element abundances in the LMC.

Subsequently, the\nproblem was attacked by restricting the power of 2DFAs (e.g., using a\nrestricted input head movement) to the degree for which it was already possible\nto derive some exponential gaps between the weaker model and the standard\n2NFAs. Here we use an opposite approach, increasing the power of 2DFAs to the\ndegree for which it is still possible to obtain a subexponential conversion\nfrom the stronger model to the standard 2DFAs. In particular, it turns out that\nsubexponential conversion is possible for two-way automata that make\nnondeterministic choices only when the input head scans one of the input tape\nendmarkers. However, there is no restriction on the input head movement. This\nimplies that an exponential gap between 2NFAs and 2DFAs can be obtained only\nfor unrestricted 2NFAs using capabilities beyond the proposed new model. As an\nadditional bonus, conversion into a machine for the complement of the original\nlanguage is polynomial in this model. The same holds for making such machines\nself-verifying, halting, or unambiguous. Finally, any superpolynomial lower\nbound for the simulation of such machines by standard 2DFAs would imply L<>NL.\nIn the same way, the alternating version of these machines is related to L =?\nNL =?

Conclusions: The present-day properties of the Hyades can be well\nreproduced by a standard King or Plummer initial model when choosing\nappropriate initial conditions. The degeneracy of good-fitting models can be\nquite high due to the large dimension of the parameter space. More simulations\nwith different Roche-lobe filling factors and primordial binary fractions are\nrequired to explore this degeneracy in more detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 14:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 07:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 16:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Wisdom (1980) showed that the chaos\nis driven by the overlap of mean motion resonances which occurs within a\ndistance (da/a)_chaos = 1.3 mu^2/7 of the planet's orbit. However, the width of\nmean motion resonances grows with the particles' eccentricity, which will\nincrease the width of the chaotic zone at higher eccentricities. Here we\ninvestigate the width of the chaotic zone using the iterated encounter map and\nN-body integrations. We find that the classical prescription works well for\nparticles on low-eccentricity orbits. However, above a critical eccentricity,\ndependent upon the mass of the planet, the width of the chaotic zone increases\nwith eccentricity. An extension of Wisdom's analytical arguments then shows\nthat, above the critical eccentricity, the chaotic zone width is given by\n(da/a)_chaos = 1.8 e^1/5 mu^1/5, which agrees well with the encounter map\nresults. The critical eccentricity is given by e_cr = 0.21 mu^3/7. This\nextended chaotic zone results in a larger cleared region when a planet sculpts\nthe inner edge of a debris disc comprised of eccentric planetesimals. Hence,\nthe planet mass estimated from the classical chaotic zone may be erroneous. We\napply this result to the HR8799 system, showing that the masses of HR8799b\ninferred from the truncation of the disc may vary by up to 50% depending on the\ndisc particles' eccentricities. With a disc edge at 90AU, the necessary mass of\nplanet b to cause the truncation would be 8-10 Jovian masses if the disc\nparticles have low eccentricities (<0.02), but only 4-8 Jovian masses if the\ndisc particles have higher eccentricities. Our result also has implications for\nthe ability of a planet to feed material into an inner system, a process which\nmay explain metal pollution in White Dwarf atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 14:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In the case of planet or brown dwarf mass\ncompanions, we investigate the observational properties of the spiral-onion\nshell wakes due to the gravitational interaction of these companions with the\noutflowing circumstellar matter. Three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations\nat high resolution show that the substellar mass objects produce detectable\nsignatures at 100 AU distance, for the wake induced by a Jupiter to brown dwarf\nmass object orbiting a solar mass AGB star. In particular, the arm pattern\npropagates with a speed depending on the local wind and sound speeds, implying\npossible variations in the arm separation in the wind acceleration region\nand/or in a slow wind with significant temperature variation. The pattern\npropagation speeds of the inner and outer boundaries differ by twice the sound\nspeed, leading to the overlap of high density boundaries in slow winds and\nproducing a subpattern of the spiral arm feature. Vertically, the wake forms\nconcentric arcs with angular sizes anticorrelated to the wind Mach number. We\nprovide an empirical formula for the peak density enhancement as a function of\nthe mass, orbital distance, and velocity of the object as well as the wind and\nlocal sound speeds.

It is shown how they\ncan be adversely affected by the assumption of a mean stellar atmosphere\ninstead of appropriate \"local\" atmospheres corresponding to the actual\nabundances in a given region. The essenceof the difficulties was already shown\nby Chandrasekhar's picket-fence model. The results obtained with a suite of\nStokes codes written in the Ada programming language and based on modern\nline-blanketed atmospheres are described in detail. We demonstrate that the\nhigh metallicity values claimed to have been found in chemically inhomogeneous\nAp star atmospheres would lead to local temperature structures, continuum and\nline intensities, and line shapes that differ significantly from those\npredicted by a mean stellar atmosphere. Unfortunately, past applications of ZDM\nhave consistently overlooked the intricate aspects of metallicity with their\nall-pervading effects. The erroneous assumption of a mean atmosphere for a\nspotted star can lead to phase-dependent errors of uncomfortably large\nproportions at varying wavelengths both in the Stokes I and V profiles, making\nprecise mapping of abundances and magnetic field vectors largely impossible.\nThe relation between core and wings of the H_beta line changes, too, with\npossible repercussions on the determination of gravity and effective\ntemperature. Finally, a ZDM analysis of the synthetic Stokes spectra of a\nspotted star reveals the disturbing differences between the respective\nabundance maps based on a mean atmosphere on the one hand, and on appropriate\n\"local\" atmospheres on the other. We then discuss what this all means for\npublished ZDMresults.

We study a time-reversal\nsymmetric variant of the repulsive Hubbard model defined on a planar lattice:\nWhereas the interaction is unchanged, any fully occupied band supports a\nquantized spin Hall effect. We show that at 1/2 filling of this band, the\nground state develops spontaneously and simultaneously Ising ferromagnetic\nlong-range order and a quantized charge Hall effect when the interaction is\nsufficiently strong. We ponder on the possible practical applications, beyond\nmetrology, that the quantized charge Hall effect might have if it could be\nrealized at high temperatures and without external magnetic fields in strongly\ncorrelated materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 15:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 20:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-26"}

These results will be illustrated by sequences\nin the algebra of the finite sections method for Toeplitz operators. Then we\ndiscuss some structural consequences of fractality, which are related with the\nnotion of a compact sequence. Discretized Cuntz algebras will show that idea of\nfractality is also a very helpful guide in order to analyze concrete algebras\nof approximation sequences, which illustrates the importance of the idea of\n{\\em fractal restriction}. Our final example is the algebra of the finite\nsections method for band operators.

All ferroelectrics are\npiezoelectric, and therefore exhibit a strong intrinsic coupling between\npolarization and elastic deformation - a feature widely used in piezoelectric\ntransducers and high-displacement actuators. A less explored and exploited\nproperty is flexoelectricity, i.e. the coupling between polarization and a\nstrain gradient. Though flexoelectricity is an old concept (it was discovered\nin the Soviet Union almost 50 years ago), it is only with the advent of\nnanotechnology that its full potential is beginning to be realized, as\ngradients at the nanoscale can be much larger than at the macroscopic scale.\nHere, we demonstrate that the stress gradient generated by the tip of an atomic\nforce microscope can be used to mechanically switch the polarization in the\nnanoscale volume of a ferroelectric film. This observation shows that pure\nmechanical force can be used as a dynamic tool for polarization control,\nenabling information processing in a new type of multiferroic high-density data\nstorage devices where the memory bits are written mechanically and read\nelectrically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 15:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-07"}

It is hoped that the generality and low\nadministrative cost of this measure, which we call the Modified Greenhouse Gas\nIntensity measure (MGHG-INT), will eliminate any need to classify nations.

The proposed carbon tax is analyzed in a\nshort-term scenario, where it is shown that it can result in significant\nreduction in global emissions while keeping the economy growing at a positive\nrate.
