In the case of\nodd-odd states of the cross we find that the lowest mode is bounded when the\nwidth of the two arms is the same and stays bound up to a critical value of the\nratio between the widths; in the case of the even-odd states we find that the\nlowest mode is unbound up to a critical value of the ratio between the widths.\nOur qualitative arguments suggest that the bound state survives as the width of\nthe vertical arm becomes infinitesimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 17:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Our\nsimulations cover a range of initial orbital characteristics and gas-to-stellar\nmass fractions (from 0 to 20%), and include star formation and supernova\nfeedback. We confirm and extend previous results by showing that the specific\nangular momentum of the stellar component always decreases independently of the\norbital parameters or morphology of the satellite, and that the decrease in the\nrotation velocity of the primary galaxy is accompanied by a change in the\nanisotropy of the orbits. However, the decrease affects only the old stellar\npopulation, and not the new population formed from gas during the merging\nprocess. This means that the merging process induces an increasing difference\nin the rotational support of the old and young stellar components, with the old\none lagging with respect to the new. Even if our models are not intended\nspecifically to reproduce the Milky Way and its accretion history, we find\nthat, under certain conditions, the modeled rotational lag found is compatible\nwith that observed in the Milky Way disk, thus indicating that minor mergers\ncan be a viable way to produce it. The lag can increase with the vertical\ndistance from the disk midplane, but only if the satellite is accreted along a\ndirect orbit, and in all cases the main contribution to the lag comes from\nstars originally in the primary disk rather than from stars in the satellite\ngalaxy.

Observations in all four Stokes parameters are quite\nsparse and this is the most thorough, systematic study published to date.\n  Aims: We aim to determine polarization properties of OH masers in an\nextensive sample of stars that show copious mass loss and search for candidate\nobjects that are well-suited for high angular resolution studies.\n  Methods: Full-polarization observations of the OH 1612 and 1667 MHz maser\ntransitions were carried out for a sample of 117 AGB and post-AGB stars.\nSeveral targets were also observed in the 1665 MHz line.\n  Results: Polarized features occur in more than 75% of the sources in the\ncomplete sample and there is no intrinsic difference in the occurrence of\npolarized emission between the three classes of objects of different infrared\ncharacteristics. The highest fractional polarization occurs for the post-AGB+PN\nand the Mira+SR classes at 1612 and 1667 MHz, respectively.

We use a suite of N-body simulations following the encounter of a\nsatellite galaxy with its Milky Way-type host galaxy to gather statistics on\nthe properties of stripped-off stars. We study especially the orbital energy\ndistribution of this population.\n  We quantify the typical pattern in angular and phase space formed by the\ndebris stars. We further develop a simple stripping model predicting the\nkinematics of stripped-off stars. We show that the distribution of orbital\nenergies in the tidal debris has a typical form which can be described quite\naccurately by a simple function. Based on this we develop a method to predict\nthe energy distribution which allows us to evaluate the significance and the\nimplications of high velocity stars in satellite tidal debris.\n  Generally tidal collisions of satellite galaxy produce stars which escape\ninto the intragalactic space even if the satellite itself is on a bound orbit.\nThe main parameters determining the maximum energy kick a tidal debris star can\nget is the initial mass of the satellite and only to a lower extent its orbit.\nMain contributors to an unbound stellar population created in this way are\nmassive satellites (M_sat > 10^9 M_sun).

In the companion paper Guo &\nMathews (Paper I), we use hydrodynamic simulations to show that they could be\nproduced by a recent powerful AGN jet event. Here we further explore this\nscenario to study the potential roles of shear viscosity and cosmic ray (CR)\ndiffusion on the morphology and CR distribution of the bubbles. We show that\neven a relatively low level of viscosity (\\mu_{visc} >~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or\n~0.1% - 1% of Braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppress\nthe development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,\nresulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. Furthermore, viscosity reduces\ncirculating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix the\nCR-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. Thus\nviscosity naturally produces an edge-favored CR distribution, an important\ningredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightness\ndistribution. Generically, such a CR distribution often produces a\nlimb-brightened gamma-ray intensity distribution. However, we show that by\nincorporating CR diffusion which is strongly suppressed across the bubble\nsurface (as inferred from sharp bubble edges) but is close to canonical values\nin the bubble interior, we obtain a reasonably flat gamma-ray intensity\nprofile. The similarity of the resulting CR bubble with the observed Fermi\nbubbles strengthens our previous result in Paper I that the Fermi bubbles were\nproduced by a recent AGN jet event. Studies of the nearby Fermi bubbles may\nprovide a unique opportunity to study the potential roles of plasma viscosity\nand CR diffusion on the evolution of AGN jets and bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2011 20:00:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 19:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We then study in detail the cone over Q^111 and find agreement\nbetween the spectrum of baryonic operators in this theory and M5 branes\nwrapping 5-cycles in the Q^111 space. The physics of vacua in which these\nsymmetries are spontaneously broken precisely matches a dual gravity analysis\ninvolving resolutions of the singularity, where we are able to match\ncondensates, Goldstone bosons and global strings. We then study the\nimplications of turning on a torsion 4-form flux.

The two-input digital phase\ndetector is realized with a precision wideband digitizer connected through a\npair of symmetric active guarded transformers to the outputs of the shunts\nunder comparison. Data are first acquired asynchronously, and then transferred\nfrom on-board memory to host memory. Because of the large amount of data\ncollected the filtering process and the analysis algorithms are performed\noutside the acquisition routine. Most of the systematic errors can be\ncompensated by a proper inversion procedure.\n  The system is suitable for comparing shunts in a wide range of currents, from\nseveral hundred of milliampere up to 100 A, and frequencies ranging between 500\nHz and 100 kHz. Expanded uncertainty (k=2) less than 0.05 mrad, for frequency\nup to 100 kHz, is obtained in the measurement of the phase difference of a\ngroup of 10 A shunts, provided by some European NMIs, using a digitizer with\nsampling frequency up to 1 MHz.

The common trait shared by the two remaining local views\n- those with the potential to outperform TDM - is transmitter knowledge of the\noutgoing interference link accompanied by some common knowledge of state,\nemphasizing their importance in creating opportunities to coordinate usage of\nmore advanced schemes.\n  Our conclusions are extended to bounded gap characterizations of the capacity\nregion for the Gaussian interference channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 03:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2012 19:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-31"}

In this paper we explore the influence of\nsupermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) on their actions as gravitational\nlenses. When lenses are modelled as singular isothermal ellipsoids, binary\nblack holes change the critical curves and caustics differently as a function\nof distance. Each black hole can in principle create at least one additional\nimage, which, if observed, provides evidence of black holes. By studying how\nSMBBHs affect the cumulative distribution of magnification for images created\nby black holes, we find that the cross section for at least one such additional\nimage to have a magnification larger than $10^{-5}$ is comparable to the cross\nsection for producing multiple-images in singular isothermal lenses. Such\nadditional images may be detectable with high-resolution and large dynamic\nrange maps of multiply-imaged systems from future facilities, such as the SKA.\nThe probability of detecting at least one image (two images) with magnification\nabove $10^{-3}$ is $\\sim 0.2 \\fBH$ ($\\sim 0.05 \\fBH$) in a multiply-imaged lens\nsystem, where $\\fBH$ is the fraction of galaxies housing binary black holes.

The main findings include: (1) at a given\nmetallicity, the thick disk abundance trends are more $\\alpha$-enhanced than\nthose of the thin disk; (2) the metal-rich limit of the thick disk reaches at\nleast solar metallicities; (3) the metal-poor limit of the thin disk is around\n[Fe/H]=-0.8; (4) the thick disk shows an age-metallicity gradient; (5) the thin\ndisk does {\\it not} show an age-metallicity gradient; (6) the most metal-rich\nthick disk stars at [Fe/H]=0 are significantly older than the most metal-poor\nthin disk stars at [Fe/H]=-0.7; (7) based on our elemental abundances we find\nthat kinematical criteria produce thin and thick disk stellar samples that are\nbiased in the sense that stars from the low-velocity tail of the thick disk are\nclassified as thin disk stars, and stars from the high-velocity tail of the\nthin disk are classified as thick disk stars; (8) age criteria appears to\nproduce thin and thick disk stellar samples with less contamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 06:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The luminosity function\nclearly shows the red clump mean magnitude variation with longitude, as\nexpected from a large scale bar oriented towards us at positive Galactic\nlongitude, with a dereddened magnitude varying from Ks_0=13.4 at l=-10{\\deg} to\nKs_0=12.4 at l=+10{\\deg}. We detect a change in the orientation of the bar in\nthe central regions with |l|<4{\\deg} at b=\\pm1{\\deg}, in agreement with results\nobtained at positive latitudes by other authors. Our results are based on a\ndifferent dataset and at different latitude, which shows that this change in\nthe bar orientation is real. This suggests that there is an inner structure\ndistinct to the large-scale Galactic bar, with a different orientation angle.\nThis inner structure could be a secondary, inner bar, with a semi-major axis of\n~500 pc that is symmetric with respect to the Galactic plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 08:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The\nspectroastrometric approach consists in measuring the photocenter position of\nemission lines for different velocity channels. In a previous paper we focused\non the basic methodology and the advantages of the spectroastrometric approach\nwith a detailed set of simulations demonstrating the possibilities for black\nhole mass measurements going below the conventional spatial resolution. In this\npaper we apply the spectroastrometric method to multiple longslit and integral\nfield near infrared spectroscopic observations of Centaurus A. We find that the\napplication of the spectroastrometric method provides results perfectly\nconsistent with the more complex classical method based on rotation curves: the\nmeasured BH mass is nearly independent of the observational setup and spatial\nresolution and the spectroastrometric method allows the gas dynamics to be\nprobed down to spatial scales of ~0.02\", i.e. 1/10 of the spatial resolution\nand ~1/50 of BH sphere of influence radius. The best estimate for the BH mass\nbased on kinematics of the ionized gas is then log(MBH (sin i)^2/M\\odot)=7.5\n\\pm 0.1 which corresponds to MBH = 9.6(+2.5-1.8) \\times 10^7 M\\odot for an\nassumed disk inclination of i = 35deg. The complementarity of this method with\nthe classic rotation curve method will allow us to put constraints on the disk\ninclination which cannot be otherwise derived from spectroastrometry. With the\napplication to Centaurus A, we have shown that spectroastrometry opens up the\npossibility of probing spatial scales smaller than the spatial resolution,\nextending the measured MBH range to new domains which are currently not\naccessible: smaller BHs in the local universe and similar BHs in more distant\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 10:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

A key to their success has been to learn dictionaries\nadapted to the reconstruction of small image patches. In contrast, recent works\nhave proposed instead to learn dictionaries which are not only adapted to data\nreconstruction, but also tuned for a specific task. We introduce here such an\napproach to deblurring and digital zoom, using pairs of blurry/sharp (or\nlow-/high-resolution) images for training, as well as an effective stochastic\ngradient algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization task. Although\nthis learning problem is not convex, once the dictionaries have been learned,\nthe sharp/high-resolution image can be recovered via convex optimization at\ntest time.

Large\nradial extended axisymmetric toroidal fields trigger temporal magnification of\naccretion stress. All models display a positive dynamo-\\alpha in the northern\nhemisphere (upper disk). The parity is distinct in each model and changes on\ntimescales of 40 local orbits. In model 2\\pi, the toroidal field is mostly\nantisymmetric in respect to the midplane. The eddies of the MRI turbulence are\nhighly anisotropic. The major wavelengths of the turbulent velocity and\nmagnetic fields are between one and two disk scale heights. At the midplane, we\nfind magnetic tilt angles around 8-9 degree increasing up to 12-13 degree in\nthe corona. We conclude that an azimuthal extent of \\pi is sufficient to\nreproduce most turbulent properties in 3D global stratified simulations of\nmagnetised accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 11:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Apart from rational integer bases (double-and-add algorithm),\nimaginary quadratic integer bases are of interest for elliptic curve\ncryptography, because the Frobenius endomorphism fulfils a quadratic equation.\nOne strategy for improving the efficiency is to increase the digit set (at the\nprize of additional precomputations). A common choice is the width\\nbd-$w$\nnon-adjacent form (\\wNAF): each block of $w$ consecutive digits contains at\nmost one non-zero digit. Heuristically, this ensures a low weight, i.e.\\ number\nof non-zero digits, which translates in few costly curve operations. This paper\ninvestigates the following question: Is the \\wNAF{}-expansion optimal, where\noptimality means minimising the weight over all possible expansions with the\nsame digit set?\n  The main characterisation of optimality of \\wNAF{}s can be formulated in the\nfollowing more general setting: We consider an Abelian group together with an\nendomorphism (e.g., multiplication by a base element in a ring) and a finite\ndigit set. We show that each group element has an optimal \\wNAF{}-expansion if\nand only if this is the case for each sum of two expansions of weight 1.

From these scalings relations, we derive new physical properties of\nred giant oscillations. Various different methods were compared in order to\nvalidate the processes and to derive reliable output values. For consistency, a\nsingle method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevant\nglobal asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of the\nbackground signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of the\npower excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility of\nnon-radial modes. A method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed,\nwhich relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillation\nspectrum. The comparison of the different methods has shown the important role\nof the way the background is modelled. The convergence reached by the\ncollaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning the\noscillation power excess. We obtain several scaling relations, and identify the\ninfluence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. The effect of helium\nburning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strong\nmass-radius relation for clump stars. We find that none of the amplitude\nscaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observed\nmode amplitudes of red giant stars. In parallel, the degree-dependent mode\nvisibility exhibits important variations. Both effects seem related to the\nsignificant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. A family\nof red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties are\nanalyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 13:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The predicted star formation rates are modest, and, for the\nobscured AGNs that form the X-ray background at z < 1, the associated faint\nradio emission lies just beyond the sensitivity limits of the deepest surveys.\nHere, we search for this level of star formation by studying a sample of 359\nX-ray selected AGNs at z < 1 from the COSMOS field that are not detected by\ncurrent radio surveys. The AGNs are separated into bins based on redshift,\nX-ray luminosity, obscuration, and mid-infrared characteristics.

In contrast, AGNs not\ndetected at 24 microns are not detected in the resulting stacked radio images.\nThis result provides strong evidence that the stacked radio signals are likely\nassociated with star formation. The estimated star formation rates derived from\nthe radio stacks range from 3 solar masses per year to 29 solar masses per\nyear.

Despite the inclination\nof dipole mode with respect to the magnetic axis, we find that the dipole mode\ncan have maxima that are in phase with the magnetic maxima.

The goal\nis to find a querying strategy which maximizes the expected size of the\nmatching obtained. This stochastic matching setup is motivated by applications\nin kidney exchanges and online dating.\n  In this paper we address the query-commit problem from both theoretical and\nexperimental perspectives. First, we show that a simple class of edges can be\nqueried without compromising the optimality of the strategy. This property is\nthen used to obtain in polynomial time an optimal querying strategy when the\ninput graph is sparse. Next we turn our attentions to the kidney exchange\napplication, focusing on instances modeled over real data from existing\nexchange programs. We prove that, as the number of nodes grows, almost every\ninstance admits a strategy which matches almost all nodes. This result supports\nthe intuition that more exchanges are possible on a larger pool of\npatient/donors and gives theoretical justification for unifying the existing\nexchange programs. Finally, we evaluate experimentally different querying\nstrategies over kidney exchange instances. We show that even very simple\nheuristics perform fairly well, being within 1.5% of an optimal clairvoyant\nstrategy, that knows in advance the edges in the graph. In such a\ntime-sensitive application, this result motivates the use of committing\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 14:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-06"}

Our verification method is based on the specialization\nof constraint logic programs (CLP) and works in two phases: (1) in the first\nphase, a CLP specification of an infinite state system is specialized with\nrespect to the initial state of the system and the temporal property to be\nverified, and (2) in the second phase, the specialized program is evaluated by\nusing a bottom-up strategy. The effectiveness of the method strongly depends on\nthe generalization strategy which is applied during the program specialization\nphase. We consider several generalization strategies obtained by combining\ntechniques already known in the field of program analysis and program\ntransformation, and we also introduce some new strategies. Then, through many\nverification experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of the generalization\nstrategies we have considered.

Constructive necessary and sufficient conditions on the\nform of the open-loop controller can be provided in this case. When open-loop\ncontrol is not sufficient, filtering-based feedback control laws steering the\nevolution towards a target pure state are provided, which generalize those\navailable in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 15:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
