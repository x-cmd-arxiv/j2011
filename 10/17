In\nquantum theory, however, both notions are in some sense identical: outcome\nprobabilities are given by the overlap between two state vectors - quantum\ntheory is self-dual. In this paper, we show that this notion of self-duality\ncan be understood from a dynamical point of view. We prove that self-duality\nfollows from a computational primitive called bit symmetry: every logical bit\ncan be mapped to any other logical bit by a reversible transformation.\nSpecifically, we consider probabilistic theories more general than quantum\ntheory, and prove that every bit-symmetric theory must necessarily be\nself-dual. We also show that bit symmetry yields stronger restrictions on the\nset of allowed bipartite states than the no-signalling principle alone,\nsuggesting reversible time evolution as a possible reason for limitations of\nnon-locality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 19:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 18:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-28"}

A possible correlation between the\nmass of SMBHs and the evolutionary state of their host galaxies is expected.\nBased on the recent 2D decomposition of mid-infrared Spiter/IRAC images of\nlocal galaxies with M_bh measurements, we investigated various scaling laws,\nstudying what the best predictor of the mass of the central SMBHs is. We\nfocused on the M_bh-M_G sigma^2 law, the relation between the mass of SMBHs and\nthe kinetic energy of random motions of the corresponding host galaxies. In\norder to find the best fit for each of the scaling laws examined, we performed\na least-squares regression of M_bh on x for the considered sample of galaxies,\nx being a whatever known parameter of the galaxy bulge. Our analysis shows that\nM_bh-M_G sigma^2 law fits the examined experimental data successfully as much\nas the other known scaling laws and shows a value of chi^2 better than the\nothers, a result which is consistent with previous determinations. This means\nthat a combination of sigma and M_G could be necessary to drive the\ncorrelations between M_bh and other bulge properties. This issue has been\ninvestigated by a careful analysis of the residuals of the various relations.\nIn order to avoid rushed conclusions on galaxy activity and evolution, the\nindirect inferring of M_bh from the kinetic energy of random motions should be\nconsidered, especially when applied to higher redshift galaxies. This statement\nis suggested by a reanalysis of the SDSS data used to study the SMBH growth in\nthe nearby Universe. Adopting the M_bh-M_G sigma^2 relation instead of the\nM_bh-sigma, a radio-quiet/radio-loud dichotomy appears in the SMBH mass\ndistribution of the corresponding SDSS early-type AGN galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 23:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-29"}

This method relies on the calculation of the number\nof propagating modes and the scattering rate for each mode. The modes are\ncalculated from the energy dispersion (E(k)) of the materials which require\nheavy computation and often supply energy relation on sparse momentum (k)\ngrids. Here an efficient method to calculate the distribution of modes (DOM)\nfrom a given E(k) relationship is presented. The main features of this\nalgorithm are, (i) its ability to work on sparse dispersion data, and (ii)\ncreation of an energy grid for the DOM that is almost independent of the\ndispersion data therefore allowing for efficient and fast calculation of TE\nparameters. The inclusion of scattering effects is also straight forward. The\neffect of k-grid sparsity on the compute time for DOM and on the sensitivity of\nthe calculated TE results are provided.

Because these low-paid workers can be unreliable, nearly all such\nsystems must devise schemes to increase confidence in their answers, typically\nby assigning each task multiple times and combining the answers in an\nappropriate manner, e.g. majority voting.\n  In this paper, we consider a general model of such crowdsourcing tasks and\npose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task\nassignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability. We give\na new algorithm for deciding which tasks to assign to which workers and for\ninferring correct answers from the workers' answers. We show that our\nalgorithm, inspired by belief propagation and low-rank matrix approximation,\nsignificantly outperforms majority voting and, in fact, is optimal through\ncomparison to an oracle that knows the reliability of every worker. Further, we\ncompare our approach with a more general class of algorithms which can\ndynamically assign tasks. By adaptively deciding which questions to ask to the\nnext arriving worker, one might hope to reduce uncertainty more efficiently. We\nshow that, perhaps surprisingly, the minimum price necessary to achieve a\ntarget reliability scales in the same manner under both adaptive and\nnon-adaptive scenarios. Hence, our non-adaptive approach is order-optimal under\nboth scenarios. This strongly relies on the fact that workers are fleeting and\ncan not be exploited. Therefore, architecturally, our results suggest that\nbuilding a reliable worker-reputation system is essential to fully harnessing\nthe potential of adaptive designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 02:52:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 18:49:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 21:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 07:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

Our results cover models with\nstructured correlation matrices, such as exchangeable or circular correlation\nmodels, as well as unstructured correlation matrices. For all Gaussian copula\nmodels, the limiting distribution of the rank likelihood ratio is shown to be\nequal to that of a parametric likelihood ratio for an appropriately chosen\nmultivariate normal model. This implies that the semiparametric information\nbounds for rank-based estimators are the same as the information bounds for\nestimators based on the full data, and that the multivariate normal\ndistributions are least favorable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 03:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 06:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

End-to-End Delay (EED)\ncommunication is accomplished by the exchange of data among IP cores. Often,\nthe structure of particular messages is not adequate for the communication\npurposes. This leads to the concept of packet switching. In the context of\nNoCs, packets are composed by header, payload, and trailer. Packets are divided\ninto small pieces called Flits. It appears of importance, to meet the required\nperformance in NoC hardware resources. It should be specified in an earlier\nstep of the system design. The main attention should be given to the choice of\nsome network parameters such as the physical buffer size in the node. The EED\nand packet loss are some of the critical QoS metrics. Some real-time and\nmultimedia applications bound up these parameters and require specific hardware\nresources and particular management approaches in the NoC switch. A traffic\ncontract (SLA, Service Level Agreement) specifies the ability of a network or\nprotocol to give guaranteed performance, throughput or latency bounds based on\nmutually agreed measures, usually by prioritizing traffic.

These capacities quantify the expectations regarding\nfuture data that learning algorithms embed into classifiers.\n  This note describes a new method of quantifying information, effective\ninformation, that links algorithmic information to Shannon information, and\nalso links both to capacities arising in statistical learning theory. After\nintroducing the measure, we show that it provides a non-universal analog of\nKolmogorov complexity. We then apply it to derive basic capacities in\nstatistical learning theory: empirical VC-entropy and empirical Rademacher\ncomplexity. A nice byproduct of our approach is an interpretation of the\nexplanatory power of a learning algorithm in terms of the number of hypotheses\nit falsifies, counted in two different ways for the two capacities. We also\ndiscuss how effective information relates to information gain, Shannon and\nmutual information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 07:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 06:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-29"}

Algorithms allowing to travel on these graphs were\ndeveloped by Kohel in his thesis (1996) and later on, by Fouquet and Morain\n(2001). However, up to now, no method was known, to predict, before taking a\nstep on the volcano, the direction of this step. Hence, in Kohel's and\nFouquet-Morain algorithms, many steps are taken before choosing the right\ndirection. In particular, ascending or horizontal isogenies are usually found\nusing a trial-and-error approach. In this paper, we propose an alternative\nmethod that efficiently finds all points $P$ of order $\\ell$ such that the\nsubgroup generated by $P$ is the kernel of an horizontal or an ascending\nisogeny.

The production of large\nmolecules, as we know it today, requires good catalysts, and the only good\ncatalysts we know that can accomplish this task consist of large molecules.\nThus the origin of large molecules is a chicken and egg problem in chemistry.\nHere we present a mechanism, based on autocatalytic sets (ACSs), that is a\npossible solution to this problem. We discuss a mathematical model describing\nthe population dynamics of molecules in a stylized but prebiotically plausible\nchemistry. Large molecules can be produced in this chemistry by the coalescing\nof smaller ones, with the smallest molecules, the `food set', being buffered.\nSome of the reactions can be catalyzed by molecules within the chemistry with\nvarying catalytic strengths. Normally the concentrations of large molecules in\nsuch a scenario are very small, diminishing exponentially with their size.\nACSs, if present in the catalytic network, can focus the resources of the\nsystem into a sparse set of molecules. ACSs can produce a bistability in the\npopulation dynamics and, in particular, steady states wherein the ACS molecules\ndominate the population. However to reach these steady states from initial\nconditions that contain only the food set typically requires very large\ncatalytic strengths, growing exponentially with the size of the catalyst\nmolecule. We present a solution to this problem by studying `nested ACSs', a\nstructure in which a small ACS is connected to a larger one and reinforces it.\nWe show that when the network contains a cascade of nested ACSs with the\ncatalytic strengths of molecules increasing gradually with their size (e.g., as\na power law), a sparse subset of molecules including some very large molecules\ncan come to dominate the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 09:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-01"}

In all our examples the averaged equations exhibit\nthe universal structure: the Reynolds-stress-type terms (or the\ncross-correlations) are transformed into drift velocities, pseudo-diffusion,\nand two other terms reminiscent of Moffatt's mean-fields in turbulence. In\nparticular, the averaged motion of a passive scalar admixture is described only\nby a drift and pseudo-diffusion. The averaged equations for a passive vectorial\nadmixture and for vortex dynamics possess two mean-field terms, additional to\npseudo-diffusion. It is remarkable that all mean-field terms (including\npseudo-diffusion) are expressed by invariant operators (Lie-derivatives) which\nmeasure the deviation of some tensors from their `frozen-in' values. Some\nphysical assumptions and the results can be build upon obtained averaged\nequations. Our physical interpretation suggests purely kinematic nature of\npseudo-diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 11:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 07:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-31"}

The absence of collisions from N-body codes is in particular a major\nshortcoming, as collisional processes are expected to significantly alter the\nresults obtained from pure N-body runs. We present a new numerical model, to\nstudy the spatial structure of perturbed debris discs at dynamical and\ncollisional steady-state. We focus on the competing effects between\ngravitational perturbations by a massive body (planet or star), collisional\nproduction of small grains, and radiation pressure placing these grains in\npossibly dynamically unstable regions. We consider a disc of parent bodies at\ndynamical steady-state, from which small radiation-pressure-affected grains are\nreleased in a series of runs, each corresponding to a different orbital\nposition of the perturber, where particles are assigned a collisional\ndestruction probability. These collisional runs produce successive position\nmaps that are then recombined, following a complex procedure, to produce\nsurface density profiles for each orbital position of the perturbing body.

Both are represented by second rank field\ntensors with, in general, six independent components. Measurements of these\nquantities are usually achieved by measuring a property that depends on the\ntranslational symmetry and periodicity of the crystal lattice, such as optical\nphonon energies using Raman spectroscopy, the electronic band gap using\ncathodoluminescence, photoelasticity via the optical birefringence, or Electron\nBack Scattering Diffraction (EBSD). A reciprocal relationship therefore exists\nbetween the maximum sensitivity of the measurements and the spatial resolution.\nFurthermore, of these techniques, only EBSD and off-axis Raman spectroscopy\nallow measurement of all six components of the stress tensor, but neither is\nable to provide full 3D maps. Here we demonstrate a method for measuring the\nfull stress tensor in diamond, using the spectral and optical polarization\nproperties of the photoluminescence from individual nitrogen vacancy (NV)\ncolour centres. We demonstrate a sensitivity of order 10 MPa, limited by local\nfluctuations in the stress in the sample, and corresponding to a strain of\nabout 10^-5, comparable with the best sensitivity provided by other techniques.\nBy using the colour centres as built-in local sensors, the technique overcomes\nthe reciprocal relationship between spatial resolution and sensitivity and\noffers the potential for measuring strains as small as 10^-9 at spatial\nresolution of order 10 nm. Furthermore it provides a straightforward route to\nvolumetric stress mapping. Aside from its value in understanding strain\ndistributions in diamond, this new approach to stress and strain measurement\ncould be adapted for use in micro or nanoscale sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 13:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

The consequences\nof the anisotropy of the dipolar force on the virial theorem are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 13:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In absence of nonlinear coupling, we\nhave shown previously that these systems establish a non-equilibrium critical\nsteady state [Nature Phys. 6, 806 (2010)].

However at second order, the back\naction of the mode coupling on the critical state leads to renormalization of\ndissipation and emergence of an effective temperature. In the Josephson\njunction the temperature is parametrically small allowing to observe a\nuniversal crossover between the superconducting and insulating regimes. The IV\ncharacteristics of the junction displays algebraic behavior controlled by the\nunderlying critical state over a wide range. In the noisy one dimensional\nliquid the generated dissipation and effective temperature are not small as in\nthe junction. We find a crossover between a quasi-localized regime dominated by\ndissipation and another dominated by temperature. However since in the thermal\nregime the thermalization rate is parametrically small, signatures of the\nnon-equilibrium critical state can be seen in transient dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 14:29:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 22:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-23"}

However, for large theta(13), we show that the lower threshold\nand the backgrounds reconstructed at lower energies allow in fact for muon\nenergies as low as 5 to 8 GeV at considerably shorter baselines, such as\nFermilab to Homestake. This suggests that with the latest MIND simulation, low-\nand high-energy versions of the Neutrino Factory are just two different forms\nof the same experiment optimized for different regions of the parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 14:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}

The device consists of a tapered conduit filled\nwith aqueous solution. The conduit is subjected to a DC electric field with the\nnegative pole at the narrow end and to pressure-driven flow directed from the\nnarrow end. The nematode is inserted at the conduit's wide end. Directed by the\nelectric field (through electrotaxis), the nematode swims deliberately upstream\ntoward the negative pole of the DC field. As the conduit narrows, the average\nfluid velocity and the drag force on the nematode increase. Eventually, the\nnematode arrives at an equilibrium position, at which its propulsive force\nbalances the viscous drag force induced by the adverse flow. The equilibrium\nposition of different animals, with similar body lengths, was measured as a\nfunction of the flow rate. The flow field around the nematode was obtained by\ndirect numerical simulations with the experimentally imaged gait and the\ntapered geometry of the conduit as boundary conditions. The flow field\ngenerated by a swimming worm is similar to the one induced by two pairs of\ncounter rotating rotors. Equilibrium positions under different flow rates were\nidentified by finding the positions at which the horizontal component of the\ntotal force exerted on the worm body vanishes. The theoretically predicted\nequilibrium positions were compared and favorably agreed with the experimental\ndata. The nematode's propulsive power was calculated by integrating the product\nof velocity and total stress over the worm's body surface. The device is useful\nto retain the nematodes at a nearly fixed position for prolonged observations\nof active animals under a microscope, to keep the nematode exercising, and to\nestimate the nematode's power consumption based on the conduit's width at the\nequilibrium position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 15:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}

At higher accretion rates a free-fall\ngap above the neutron star magnetosphere appears due to rapid Compton cooling,\nand accretion becomes highly non-stationary. From observations of the\nspin-up/spin-down rates (the angular rotation frequency derivative $\\dot\n\\omega^*$, and $\\partial\\dot\\omega^*/\\partial\\dot M$ near the torque reversal)\nof X-ray pulsars with known orbital periods, it is possible to determine the\nmain dimensionless parameters of the model, as well as to estimate the magnetic\nfield of the neutron star. We illustrate the model by determining these\nparameters for three wind-fed X-ray pulsars GX 301-2, Vela X-1, and GX 1+4. The\nmodel explains both the spin-up/spin-down of the pulsar frequency on large\ntime-scales and the irregular short-term frequency fluctuations, which can\ncorrelate or anti-correlate with the X-ray flux fluctuations in different\nsystems. It is shown that in real pulsars an almost iso-angular-momentum\nrotation law with $\\omega \\sim 1/R^2$, due to strongly anisotropic radial\nturbulent motions sustained by large-scale convection, is preferred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 15:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The standard solution to this problem\ninvolves computing the zone graph of the automaton, which in principle could be\ninfinite. In order to make the graph finite, zones are approximated using an\nextrapolation operator. For reasons of efficiency in current algorithms\nextrapolation of a zone is always a zone and in particular it is convex.\n  In this paper, we propose to solve the reachability problem without such\nextrapolation operators. To ensure termination, we provide an efficient\nalgorithm to check if a zone is included in the so called region closure of\nanother. Although theoretically better, closure cannot be used in the standard\nalgorithm since a closure of a zone may not be convex.\n  An additional benefit of the proposed approach is that it permits to\ncalculate approximating parameters on-the-fly during exploration of the zone\ngraph, as opposed to the current methods which do it by a static analysis of\nthe automaton prior to the exploration. This allows for further improvements in\nthe algorithm.
