Blazars are radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a jet\npointing at small angles towards the observer. The overall emitted spectrum is\ntypically non-thermal, and in some cases the emission and/or absorption lines\nare so faint as to prevent the determination of the redshift based on optical\nspectroscopy methods. PKS 0447-439 is a bright blazar recently detected at very\nhigh energy. The redshift of the source is still disputed: a recent spectral\nanalysis reports only a lower limit of z > 1.246, which contradicts the\nprevious measure of z = 0.205 reported in the literature. Aims. We aim to give\na redshift estimate of the blazar PKS 0447-439 based on combined GeV\n(Fermi/LAT) and TeV (H.E.S.S.) observations. Methods. Taking into account the\nabsorption of TeV photons by the interaction with the extragalactic background\nlight (EBL), we applied the method we developed in a previous work to derive\nthe redshift of PKS 0447-439. Moreover, we compiled the overall spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) using optical-UV, soft X-ray, and -ray data, nearly\nsimultaneous to the H.E.S.S. observations at TeV energies. Finally we modelled\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) within the framework of a homogeneous,\nleptonic synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Results. Using the recent TeV\nspectrum measured by H.E.S.S. we obtain for PKS 0447-439 a redshift of zrec =\n0.20 \\pm 0.05, which is our estimate on the source distance. This value agrees\nvery well with the value reported in the literature and confirms that our\nmethod can be successfully used to constrain blazars distances. Assuming this\ndistance, the SED can be well fitted with the above mentioned model. The\nphysical parameters that we find suggest a strongly matter-dominated jet.\nConclusions. Our analysis confirms that the redshift of PKS 0447-439 is likely\n0.2, and supports the result present in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 16:06:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2012 08:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}

In order to estimate the systematic errors in these measurements we\nconsider the counts variance finding that it shows systematic finite size\neffects which depend on the samples sizes. We clarify, by making specific\ntests, that these are due to galaxy long-range correlations extending up to the\nlargest scales of the sample. The analysis of mock galaxy catalogs, generated\nfrom cosmological N-body simulations of the standard LCDM model, shows that for\nr<20 Mpc/h the counts exponent is D~2.0, weakly dependent on galaxy luminosity,\nwhile D=3 at larger scales. In addition, contrary to the case of the observed\ngalaxy samples, no systematic finite size effects in the counts variance are\nfound at large scales, a result that agrees with the absence of large scale,\nr~100 Mpc/h, correlations in the mock catalogs. We thus conclude that the\nobserved galaxy distribution is characterized by correlations, fluctuations and\nhence structures, which are larger, both in amplitude and in spatial extension,\nthan those predicted by the standard model LCDM of galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 16:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Using a Skyrme-like model for\nnuclear matter, we construct baseline sequences of crust models by consistently\nvarying the density dependence of the bulk symmetry energy at nuclear\nsaturation density, $L$, under two conditions: (i) that the magnitude of the\nsymmetry energy at saturation density $J$ is held constant, and (ii) $J$\ncorrelates with $L$ under the constraint that the pure neutron matter (PNM) EoS\nsatisfies the results of ab-initio calculations at low densities. Such baseline\ncrust models facilitate consistent exploration of the $L$ dependence of crustal\nproperties. The remaining surface energy and symmetric nuclear matter\nparameters are systematically varied around the baseline, and different\nfunctional forms of the PNM EoS at sub-saturation densities implemented, to\nestimate theoretical `error bars' for the baseline predictions. Inner crust\ncomposition and transition densities are shown to be most sensitive to the\nsurface energy at very low proton fractions and to the behavior of the\nsub-saturation PNM EoS. Recent calculations of the energies of neutron drops\nsuggest that the low-proton-fraction surface energy might be higher than\npredicted in Skyrme-like models, which our study suggests may result in a\ngreatly reduced volume of pasta in the crust than conventionally predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 16:24:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 23:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Our visual classifications of\nthese two samples indicate that the fraction of objects with disk and spheroid\nmorphologies is roughly the same but that there are significantly more mergers,\ninteractions, and irregular galaxies among the ULIRGs. The combination of disk\nand irregular/interacting morphologies suggests that early stage interactions\nand minor mergers could play an important role in ULIRGs at z~2. We compare\nthese fractions with those of a z~1 sample across a wide luminosity range and\nfind that the fraction of disks decreases systematically with L_IR while the\nfraction of mergers and interactions increases, as has been observed locally.\nAt comparable luminosities, the fraction of ULIRGs with various morphological\nclassifications is similar at z~2 and z~1. We investigate the position of the\nULIRGs, along with 70 LIRGs, on the specific star formation rate versus\nredshift plane, and find 52 systems to be starbursts (lie more than a factor of\n3 above the main sequence relation). The morphologies of starbursts are\ndominated by interacting and merging systems (50%). If irregular disks are\nincluded as potential minor mergers, then we find that up to 73% of starbursts\nare involved in a merger or interaction at some level.

We prove a package of facts that provide a possible\nanswer. Let us call a system typical, if the homeomorphic type of its set of\nsolutions does not change as we perturb its (non-zero) coefficients. The set of\nall atypical systems turns out to be a hypersurface in the space of all systems\nof k equations in n variables, whose monomials are contained in k given finite\nsets. This hypersurface B contains all systems that have a singular solution,\nthis stratum is conventionally called the discriminant, and the codimension of\nits components has not been fully understood yet (e.g. dual defect toric\nvarieties are not classified), so the purity of dimension of B looks somewhat\nsurprising. We deduce it from a similar tropical purity fact.\n  A generic system of equations in a component B_i of the hypersurface B\ndiffers from a typical system by the Euler characteristic of its set of\nsolutions. Regarding the difference of these Euler characteristics as the\nmultiplicity of B_i, we turn B into an effective divisor, whose equation we\ncall the Euler discriminant by the following reasons. Firstly, it vanishes\nexactly at those systems that have a singular solution (possibly at infinity).\nSecondly, despite its topological definition, there is a simple\nlinear-algebraic formula for it, and a positive formula for its Newton\npolytope. Thirdly, it interpolates many classical objects (sparse resultant,\nA-determinant, discriminant of deformation) and inherits many of their nice\nproperties. This allows to specialize our results to generic polynomial maps:\nthe bifurcation set of a dominant polynomial map, whose components are generic\nlinear combinations of finitely many monomials, is always a hypersurface, and a\ngeneric atypical fiber of such a map differs from a typical one by its Euler\ncharacteristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 17:34:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 May 2012 16:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-22"}

One of the three\nunclassified variables may be a non-member on account of its large angular\ndistance from the center of the cluster. Four of the six faintest variable\nstars, which include two eclipsing binaries and two very red stars showing\nyear-to-year variations, are certain non-members. One of the remaining two\nfaintest variable stars, an EA-type eclipsing binary may be a member, while the\nfaintest one, a W Ursae Majoris-type variable, is probably a non-member.

Dielectric breakdown (visible as electrolysis) is frequently evident\nslightly beyond the onset of the contact angle saturation. Here, plasma\nenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is used to deposit thin fluorocarbon\nfilms prior to the spin-coating of Teflon\\textregistered amorphous\nfluoropolymer on tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) substrates. The resulting\nmultilayered hydrophobic top coating improves the electrowetting performance of\nthe stack, by showing high resistance to dielectric breakdown at high applied\nvoltages and for continuous long term application of DC and AC voltage. Leakage\ncurrent measurements during electrowetting experiments with the proposed\ncomposite coating showed that current remains fairly constant at consecutive\nelectrowetting tests in contrast to plain Teflon\\textregistered coating in\nwhich material degradation is evident by a progressive increase of the leakage\ncurrent after multiple electrowetting tests. Since the proposed composite\ncoating demonstrates increased resistance to material failure and to dielectric\nbreakdown even at thin configurations, its integration in electrowetting\ndevices may impact their reliability, robustness and lifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 18:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}

This situation\npersists despite the potential for the Milky Way to serve as the ultimate SFR\ncalibrator for external galaxies. We show that various estimates for the\nGalactic SFR are consistent with one another once they have been normalized to\nthe same initial mass function (IMF) and massive star models, converging to 1.9\n+/- 0.4 M_sun/yr. However, standard SFR diagnostics are vulnerable to\nsystematics founded in the use of indirect observational tracers sensitive only\nto high-mass stars. We find that absolute SFRs measured using resolved\nlow/intermediate-mass stellar populations in Galactic H II regions are\nsystematically higher by factors of ~2-3 as compared with calibrations for SFRs\nmeasured from mid-IR and radio emission. We discuss some potential explanations\nfor this discrepancy and conclude that it could be allayed if (1) the power-law\nslope of the IMF for intermediate-mass (1.5 M_sun < m < 5 M_sun) stars were\nsteeper than the Salpeter slope, or (2) a correction factor was applied to the\nextragalactic 24 micron SFR calibrations to account for the duration of star\nformation in individual mid-IR-bright H II regions relative to the lifetimes of\nO stars. Finally, we present some approaches for testing if a Galactic SFR of\n~2 M_sun/yr is consistent with what we would measure if we could view the Milky\nWay as external observers. Using luminous radio supernova remnants and X-ray\npoint sources, we find that the Milky Way deviates from expectations at the 1-3\nsigma level, hinting that perhaps the Galactic SFR is overestimated or\nextragalactic SFRs need to be revised upwards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The geometric albedos of Vesta from 220 nm to 953 nm are\nderived by carefully comparing these observations from various instruments at\ndifferent times and observing geometries. Vesta has a rotationally averaged\ngeometric albedo of 0.09 at 250 nm, 0.14 at 300 nm, 0.26 at 373 nm, 0.38 at 673\nnm, and 0.30 at 950 nm. The linear spectral slope as measured between 240 and\n320 nm in the ultraviolet displays a sharp minimum near a sub-Earth longitude\nof 20^{\\circ}, and maximum in the eastern hemisphere. This is consistent with\nthe longitudinal distribution of the spectral slope in the visible wavelength.\nThe photometric uncertainty in the ultraviolet is ~20%, and in the visible\nwavelengths it is better than 10%. The amplitude of Vesta's rotational\nlightcurves is ~10% throughout the range of wavelengths we observed, but is\nsmaller at 950 nm (~6%) near the 1-\\mum band center. Contrary to earlier\nreports, we found no evidence for any difference between the phasing of the\nultraviolet and visible/near-infrared lightcurves with respect to sub-Earth\nlongitude. Vesta's average spectrum between 220 and 950 nm can well be\ndescribed by measured reflectance spectra of fine particle howardite-like\nmaterials of basaltic achondrite meteorites. Combining this with the in-phase\nbehavior of the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared lightcurves, and the\nspectral slopes with respect to the rotational phase, we conclude that there is\nno global ultraviolet/visible reversal on Vesta. Consequently, this implies a\nlack of global space weathering on Vesta, as previously inferred from\nvisible-near-infrared data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 20:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-08"}

Methods: We obtained low\nresolution multi-object spectroscopy with the VIMOS instrument at the ESO VLT\nof ~ 800 stars in seven fields centred on NGC 6822. The spectroscopic\nclassification of giant stars in NGC 6822 and foreground dwarf contaminants was\nmade by comparing more than 500 good quality spectra with the spectroscopic\natlas of Turnshek et al.

Recently a simplified approach, using a one\nsample t test score to assess enrichment and ignoring gene-gene correlations\nwas proposed by Irizarry et al. 2009 as a serious contender. The argument\ncriticizes GSEA's nonparametric nature and its use of an empirical null\ndistribution as unnecessary and hard to compute. We refute these claims by\ncareful consideration of the assumptions of the simplified method and its\nresults, including a comparison with GSEA's on a large benchmark set of 50\ndatasets. Our results provide strong empirical evidence that gene-gene\ncorrelations cannot be ignored due to the significant variance inflation they\nproduced on the enrichment scores and should be taken into account when\nestimating gene set enrichment significance.

After a short history of\ndiscoveries of superconducting materials, we share our own guidelines for\nsearching for high-temperature superconductors. Finally, we show how point\ncontact spectroscopy (PCS) is used to detect strong correlations in the normal\nstate with a focus on the strongly-correlated region in the normal state of the\nFe-based superconductors, defining a new region in the phase diagram of\nBa(Fe1-xCox)2As2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 00:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-20"}

This functionality allows the network\nto eliminate data-redundancy in traffic, thereby saving on routing costs. We\nconsider two problems within this framework and design approximation\nalgorithms.\n  The first problem we study is the traffic-redundancy aware network design\n(RAND) problem. We are given a weighted graph over a single server and many\nclients. The server owns a number of different data packets and each client\ndesires a subset of the packets; the client demand sets form a laminar set\nsystem. Our goal is to connect every client to the source via a single path,\nsuch that the collective cost of the resulting network is minimized. Here the\ntransportation cost over an edge is its weight times times the number of\ndistinct packets that it carries.\n  The second problem is a facility location problem that we call RAFL. Here the\ngoal is to find an assignment from clients to facilities such that the total\ncost of routing packets from the facilities to clients (along unshared paths),\nplus the total cost of \"producing\" one copy of each desired packet at each\nfacility is minimized.\n  We present a constant factor approximation for the RAFL and an O(log P)\napproximation for RAND, where P is the total number of distinct packets. We\nremark that P is always at most the number of different demand sets desired or\nthe number of clients, and is generally much smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 00:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-20"}

We have defined a class-based\nconcurrent object-oriented language that formalises such protocols in the form\nof usage types. Usage types are attached to class definitions, allowing for the\nspecification of (1) the available methods, (2) the tests clients must perform\non the result of methods, and (3) the object status - linear or shared - all of\nwhich depend on the object's state. Our work extends the recent approach on\nmodular session types by eliminating channel operations, and defining the\nmethod call as the single communication primitive in both sequential and\nconcurrent settings. In contrast to previous works, we define a single category\nfor objects, instead of distinct categories for linear and for shared objects,\nand let linear objects evolve into shared ones. We introduce a standard sync\nqualifier to prevent thread interference in certain operations on shared\nobjects.

Analysis of this 'biobackground' was\nundertaken in the 1-10 um size range and a 3-9% contribution was found to be\nbiological in origin - values which are in good agreement with other studies\nreported in the literature. A model based on the physics of turbulent mixing\nand dispersion was developed and validated against this analysis. The Gamma\ndistribution (the basis of our model) is shown to comply with the scaling laws\nof the concentration moments of our data, which enables us to universally\ncharacterise both biological and non-biological material in the atmosphere. An\napplication of this model is proposed to build a framework for the development\nof novel algorithms for bio-aerosol detection and rapid characterisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 05:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 06:34:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 04:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

Around T Tauri stars, most mid-infrared (MIR) radiation (in a few to a\nfew ten {\\mu}m wavelength range) emerge from regions around a fraction to a few\nAU's. This region is interesting because it contains both the habitable zone\nand the snow line. Recent observations reveal that SED variations, in the MIR\nwavelength range. These variations are puzzling because they occur on time\nscale (a few days) which is much shorter than the dynamical (months to years)\ntime scale at 1AU to a few AU's. They are probably caused by shadows casted by\ninner onto outer disk regions. Interaction between disks and their misaligned\nmagnetized host stars can lead to warped structure and periodic SED\nmodulations. Rapid aperiodic SED variations may also be induced by observed\nX-ray flares from T Tauri stars. These flares can significantly modulate the\nionization fraction of the gas and the net charge carried by the grains near\nthe surface of the inner disk. The newly charged grains may be accelerated by\nthe stellar or disk magnetic field and adjust their distances from the\nmidplane. Shadows casted by these grains attenuates the flux of stellar photons\nirradiated onto regions at several AU's from the central stars. We use this\nmodel to account for the observed rapid aperiodic SED variabilities. We suggest\nregular monitoring of SED variations will not only provide valuable information\non the distribution of the disk aspect ratio near the habitable zone but also\nprovide a probe on the interaction between the inner regions of the disk with\nthe magnetosphere of their host stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 05:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

For s<2, instead, the quenched disorder\nis found to be irrelevant and the dynamical exponent is z=1 like in a\nhomogeneous environment. At the critical point, s=2, the interplay between\nquenched disorder and long-range connections results in activated scaling,\nhowever, with a non-trivial barrier exponent \\psi(\\beta), which decays\ncontinuously with \\beta, but is independent of the form of the quenched\ndisorder. Upper and lower bounds on \\psi(\\beta) are established and numerical\nestimates are given for various values of \\beta. Beside random walks, accurate\nnumerical estimates of the graph dimension and the resistance exponent are\ngiven for various values of \\beta at s=2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 09:28:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 09:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 09:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

Despite the large interstellar reddening towards Cyg OB2, many studies,\nspanning a wide range of wavelengths, have been conducted to more clearly\nunderstand this association. X-ray observations provide a powerful tool to\novercome the effect of interstellar absorption and study the most energetic\nprocesses associated with the stars in Cyg OB2. We analyse XMM-Newton data to\ninvestigate the X-ray and UV properties of massive O-type stars as well as\nlow-mass pre-main sequence stars in Cyg OB2. We obtained six XMM-Newton\nobservations of the core of Cyg OB2. In our analysis, we pay particular\nattention to the variability of the X-ray bright OB stars, especially the\nluminous blue variable candidate Cyg OB2 #12. We find that X-ray variability is\nquite common among the stars in Cyg OB2. Whilst short-term variations are\nrestricted mostly to low-mass pre-main sequence stars, one third of the OB\nstars display long-term variations. The X-ray flux of Cyg OB2 #12 varies by\n37%, over timescales from days to years, whilst its mean log(L_X/L_bol) amounts\nto -6.10. These properties suggest that Cyg OB2 #12 is either an\ninteracting-wind system or displays a magnetically confined wind.

Through black-body fitting of the\nMIPS SEDs we find the large grains to be warm, 29-66 K. The dust emission is\nmodeled using the DUSTEM code and a three component dust model composed of\npopulations of big grains, very small grains, and polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons. We find the dust to be moderately heated, typically by 30-100\ntimes the interstellar radiation field. The source of the radiation is likely\nhydrogen recombination, where the excitation of hydrogen occurred in the shock\nfront. The ratio of very small grains to big grains is found for most of the\nmolecular interacting SNRs to be higher than that found in the plane of the\nMilky Way, typically by a factor of 2--3. We suggest that dust shattering is\nresponsible for the relative over-abundance of small grains, in agreement with\nprediction from dust destruction models. However, two of the SNRs are best fit\nwith a very low abundance of carbon grains to silicate grains and with a very\nhigh radiation field. A likely reason for the low abundance of small carbon\ngrains is sputtering.

A\nsubcube of $\\{0,1\\}^d$ is a subset of $2^k$ of its points formed by fixing $k$\ncoordinates and allowing the remaining $d-k$ to vary freely. The subcube\nstructure of the discrete cube is surprisingly complicated and there are many\nopen questions relating to it.\n  This paper is concerned with patterns of intersections among subcubes of the\ndiscrete cube. Two sample questions along these lines are as follows: given a\nfamily of subcubes in which no $r+1$ of them have non-empty intersection, how\nmany pairwise intersections can we have? How many subcubes can we have if among\nthem there are no $k$ which have non-empty intersection and no $l$ which are\npairwise disjoint? These questions are naturally expressed as Tur\\'an and\nRamsey type questions in intersection graphs of subcubes where the intersection\ngraph of a family of sets has one vertex for each set in the family with two\nvertices being adjacent if the corresponding subsets intersect.\n  Tur\\'an and Ramsey type problems are at the heart of extremal combinatorics\nand so these problems are mathematically natural. However, a second motivation\nis a connection with some questions in social choice theory arising from a\nsimple model of agreement in a society. Specifically, if we have to make a\nbinary choice on each of $n$ separate issues then it is reasonable to assume\nthat the set of choices which are acceptable to an individual will be\nrepresented by a subcube. Consequently, the pattern of intersections within a\nfamily of subcubes will have implications for the level of agreement within a\nsociety.\n  We pose a number of questions and conjectures relating directly to the\nTur\\'an and Ramsey problems as well as raising some further directions for\nstudy of subcube intersection graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 13:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-20"}

By applying the Gagnon-B\\'{e}langer gauge transformation,\nmulti-peak `inverted gravity-like' solitary waves are predicted. We also\ndemonstrate that the pulse dynamics shows the ejection of solitons during\npropagation in such fibers, analogous to what happens in conventional\nsolid-core fibers. Moreover, unconventional long-range non-local interactions\nbetween temporally distant solitons, unique of gas plasma systems, are\npredicted and studied. Finally, the effects of higher-order dispersion\ncoefficients and the shock operator on the pulse dynamics are investigated,\nshowing that the resonant radiation in the UV [Joly et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n106] can be improved via plasma formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 14:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

In contrast to\nprevious work on random financial networks, which assumes independent\nconnections between banks, the possibility of disassortative edge probabilities\n(an above average tendency for small banks to link to large banks) is\nexplicitly incorporated. We give a probabilistic analysis of the default\ncascade triggered by shocking the network. We find that the cascade can be\nunderstood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge probabilities that\nconverges to a fixed point. A cascade condition is derived that characterizes\nwhether or not an infinitesimal shock to the network can grow to a finite size\ncascade, in analogy to the basic reproduction number $R_0$ in epidemic\nmodeling. It provides an easily computed measure of the systemic risk inherent\nin a given banking network topology. An analytic formula is given for the\nfrequency of global cascades, derived from percolation theory on the random\nnetwork. Two simple examples are used to demonstrate that edge-assortativity\ncan have a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the\ncascade condition. Although the analytical methods are derived for infinite\nnetworks, large-scale Monte Carlo simulations are presented that demonstrate\nthe applicability of the results to finite-sized networks.

The outcome is the same if we apply the\nMIC relations to a sample of eight RGs in the bulge globular cluster NGC6522,\nbut the standard deviation ranges from 0.26 (hk, v-y) to 0.49 (hk, u-y). The\ndifference is mainly caused by a difference in photometric accuracy. The new\nMIC relations based on the (Ca-y) color provide metallicities systematically\nmore metal-rich than the spectroscopic ones.
