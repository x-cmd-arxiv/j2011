In this paper, we treat granular\nmaterials as spatially-embedded networks in which the nodes (particles) are\nconnected by weighted edges obtained from contact forces. We test a variety of\nnetwork measures for their utility in helping to describe sound propagation in\ngranular networks and find that network diagnostics can be used to probe\nparticle-, curve-, domain-, and system-scale structures in granular media. In\nparticular, diagnostics of meso-scale network structure are reproducible across\nexperiments, are correlated with sound propagation in this medium, and can be\nused to identify potentially interesting size scales. We also demonstrate that\nthe sensitivity of network diagnostics depends on the phase of sound\npropagation. In the injection phase, the signal propagates systemically, as\nindicated by correlations with the network diagnostic of global efficiency. In\nthe scattering phase, however, the signal is better predicted by meso-scale\ncommunity structure, suggesting that the acoustic signal scatters over local\ngeographic neighborhoods. Collectively, our results demonstrate how the force\nnetwork of a granular system is imprinted on transmitted waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 17:07:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 04:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The effectiveness of an IDS is directly\nrelated to the computational resources at its disposal. However, it is\ndifficult to guarantee especially with an increasing demand of network capacity\nand rapid proliferation of attacks. On the other hand, modern intrusions often\ncome as sequences of attacks to reach some predefined goals. It is therefore\ncritical to identify the best default IDS configuration to attain the highest\npossible overall protection within a given resource budget. This paper proposes\na game theory based solution to the problem of optimal signature-based IDS\nconfiguration under resource constraints.

In this work\nlight-induced electron spin resonance (LESR) spectra and transient ESR response\nsignals are recorded on non-annealed and annealed blend layers consisting of\nalkyl substituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene copolymers (pATBT) and the soluble\nfullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) at\ntemperatures ranging from 10 to 180 K. Annealing of the blend sample leads to a\nreduction of the steady state concentration of light-induced PCBM anions within\nthe blend at low temperatures (T = 10 K) and continuous illumination. This is\nexplained on the basis of the reducing interfacial area of the blend composite\non annealing, and the high activation energy for electron diffusion in PCBM\nblends leading to trapped electrons near the interface with the CP. As a\nconsequence, these trapped electrons block consecutive electron transfer from\nan exciton on a CP to the PCBM domain, resulting in a relatively low\nconcentration charge carriers in the annealed blend. Analysis of the transient\nESR data allows us to conclude that in annealed samples diamagnetic\nbi-polaronic states on the CPs are generated at low temperature. The formation\nof these states is related to the generation and interaction of multiple\npositive polarons in the large crystalline polymer domains present in the\nannealed sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 20:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

We show that the stripe magnetic order is generally preempted by an\nIsing-nematic order which breaks $C_{4}$ lattice symmetry but preserves O(3)\nspin-rotational symmetry. This leads to a rich phase diagram as function of\ndoping, pressure, and elastic moduli, displaying split magnetic and nematic\ntri-critical points. The nematic transition may instantly bring the system to\nthe verge of a magnetic transition, or it may occur first, being followed by a\nmagnetic transition at a lower temperature. In the latter case, the preemptive\nnematic transition is accompanied by either a jump or a rapid increase of the\nmagnetic correlation length, triggering a pseudogap behavior associated with\nmagnetic precursors. Furthermore, due to the distinct orbital character of each\nFermi pocket, the nematic transition also induces orbital order. We compare our\nresults to various experiments, showing that they correctly address the changes\nin the character of the magneto-structural transition across the phase diagrams\nof different compounds, as well as the relationship between the orthorhombic\nand magnetic order parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2011 22:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 03:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-30"}

We obtain a comprehensive\ncollection of results on the efficiency and the approximability of IE\nstrategies, which also imply a significant improvement on the best known\napproximation ratios for revenue maximization. Specifically, we show that in\nthe Uniform Additive Model, both computing the optimal marketing strategy and\ncomputing the best IE strategy are $\\NP$-hard for undirected social networks.\nWe observe that allowing IE strategies to offer prices smaller than the myopic\nprice in the exploit step leads to a measurable improvement on their\nperformance. Thus, we show that the best IE strategy approximates the maximum\nrevenue within a factor of 0.911 for undirected and of roughly 0.553 for\ndirected networks. Moreover, we present a natural generalization of IE\nstrategies, with more than two pricing classes, and show that they approximate\nthe maximum revenue within a factor of roughly 0.7 for undirected and of\nroughly 0.35 for directed networks. Utilizing a connection between good IE\nstrategies and large cuts in the underlying social network, we obtain\npolynomial-time algorithms that approximate the revenue of the best IE strategy\nwithin a factor of roughly 0.9.

We study the modularity measure of\nthe proposed model, which can be adjusted by changing ratio of the number of\ninner-module edges and the number of inter-module edges. Based on the mean\nfield theory, we develop an analytical function of the degree distribution,\nwhich is verified by a numerical example and indicates that the degree\ndistribution shows characteristics of the small-world network and the\nscale-free network distinctly at different segments. The clustering coefficient\nand the average path length of the network are simulated numerically,\nindicating that the network shows the small-world property and is affected\nlittle by the randomness of the new module.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 03:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}

In contrast to previous work, we find stellar\npopulation trends not just with velocity dispersion and FP residual, but with\nradius and surface brightness as well.

The $v_2$ direction in FP space roughly corresponds to\n`luminosity density'.

We classify the galaxies into early and late types, and identify\nbars by visual inspection. Among 10,674 late-type galaxies with axis ratio\n$b/a>0.60$, we find 3,240 barred galaxies ($f_{bar}=30.4%$) which divide into\n2,542 strong bars ($f_{SB1}=23.8%$) and 698 weak bars ($f_{SB2}=6.5%$).

This trend suggests that strong bars are dominantly hosted by\nintermediate-mass systems. Weak bars prefer bluer galaxies with lower mass and\nlower concentration.

The Dyson time-dependent\ndiagrammatic theory in terms of the Cu-O hopping tpd, which starts from the\nnondegenerate unperturbed ground state, is translationally and asymptotically\nlocally gauge invariant. The small parameter of the theory is nd. The lowest\norder of the theory generates the single particle propagators of the hybridized\npdp- and dpd-fermions with the exact three band structure. The leading\nmany-body effect is band narrowing, obtained without mean-field slave particle\napproximations. Damping found in the single particle propagation is related to\nincoherent Cu-O2 intracell \"mixed valence\" fluctuations. The corresponding\ncontinuum falls below the Fermi level. The conventional Luttinger sum rule for\ncoherent bands is thus broken.

For LEs we expect the outer entropy ramp to bend over,\nhence the temperature decline to steepen at low z; this feature goes together\nwith an increasing turbulent support, a condition that can be directly probed\nwith the SZ effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 08:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 13:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The main idea is that the objective\nfunction is transformed to a weighted sum of rate and power. A generic problem\nformulation for systems dissipating transmit-independent circuit power in\naddition to transmit-dependent power is presented. We show that a broad class\nof EE maximization problems can be solved efficiently, provided the rate is a\nconcave function of the transmit power.

We find that rho(Delta M) ~ (Delta M)^(-tau) with an avalanche\nexponent tau=1 for the SK model, originating from the marginal stability\n(criticality) of the model.

The\nspectrum found shows a number of peculiar features, which are absent in the\nMinkowski space-time. A hypothetical particle that moves faster than light,\n\\emph{a tachyon}, is known to be classically unstable in the Minkowski\nspace-time. This instability has its analog at the quantum level: small vacuum\nfluctuations of the field lead to the unbounded growth of the amplitude, so\nthat the appearance of the real tachyons in the spectrum means that there is\ncatastrophic instability in the theory. It has been conjectured a long time ago\nthat possibly the lightest particles with nonzero mass, the neutrino, may be a\ntachyon. Here we shall show that in the rotating and expanding Universe\ntachyons are stable if their mass is less than some constant, which is related\nto the Universe's rotation and expansion scales. The current upper bound on the\nrotation scale gives us a very small upper bound on the tachyon's mass which is\nmany orders less than the mass of the electron. This might explain why only\nvery light particles have the chance of becoming tachyons.

Here, we generalize this\ndescription to biaxial particles with arbitrary shape and derive the\ncorresponding Langevin equation for a self-propelled Brownian spinning top. The\nbiaxial swimmer is exposed to a hydrodynamic Stokes friction force at low\nReynolds numbers, to fluctuating random forces and torques as well as to an\nexternal and an internal (effective) force and torque. The latter quantities\ncontrol its self-propulsion. Due to biaxiality and hydrodynamic\ntranslational-rotational coupling, the Langevin equation can only be solved\nnumerically. In the special case of an orthotropic particle in the absence of\nexternal forces and torques, the noise-free (zero-temperature) trajectory is\nanalytically found to be a circular helix. This trajectory is confirmed\nnumerically to be more complex in the general case involving a transient\nirregular motion before ending up in a simple periodic motion. By contrast, if\nthe external force vanishes, no transient regime is found and the particle\nmoves on a superhelical trajectory. For orthotropic particles, the\nnoise-averaged trajectory is a generalized concho-spiral. We furthermore study\nthe reduction of the model to two spatial dimensions and classify the\nnoise-free trajectories completely finding circles, straight lines with and\nwithout transients, as well as cycloids and arbitrary periodic trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 13:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

In order to include expert knowledge as well as\nexperimental results, one can employ an updating procedure such as Bayesian\ninference. The classical probabilistic setting of the identification process in\nBayes's form requires the solution of a stochastic forward problem via\ncomputationally expensive sampling techniques, which makes the method almost\nimpractical. In this paper novel stochastic computational techniques such as\nthe stochastic Galerkin method are applied in order to accelerate the updating\nprocedure. The idea is to replace the computationally expensive forward\nsimulation via the conventional finite element (FE) method by the evaluation of\na polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Such an approximation of the FE model for\nthe forward simulation perfectly suits the Bayesian updating.

This is certainly so for methods like the Immersed Boundary\nMethod (IBM) or the Immersed Finite Element Method (IFEM), where Dirac-delta\ndistributions are approximated via smooth functions. By contrast, a truly\nvariational formulation of immersed methods does not require the use of\nDirac-delta distributions, either formally or practically. This has been shown\nin the Finite Element Immersed Boundary Method (FEIBM), where the variational\nstructure of the problem is exploited to avoid Dirac-delta distributions at\nboth the continuous and the discrete level. In this paper, we generalize the\nFEIBM to the case where an incompressible Newtonian fluid interacts with a\ngeneral hyperelastic solid. Specifically, we allow (i) the mass density to be\ndifferent in the solid and the fluid, (ii) the solid to be either viscoelastic\nof differential type or purely elastic, and (iii) the solid to be and either\ncompressible or incompressible. At the continuous level, our variational\nformulation combines the natural stability estimates of the fluid and\nelasticity problems. In immersed methods, such stability estimates do not\ntransfer to the discrete level automatically due to the non- matching nature of\nthe finite dimensional spaces involved in the discretization. After presenting\nour general mathematical framework for the solution of FSI problems, we focus\nin detail on the construction of natural interpolation operators between the\nfluid and the solid discrete spaces, which guarantee semi-discrete stability\nestimates and strong consistency of our spatial discretization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 15:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 19:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

On the tree, this quantity decays to 0 (as the number of\nvariables increases) for any d>1.

An\nimportant part of our proof is to introduce an appropriate substitute for the\narea functional used in the time-symmetric case.

Hall\ndiffusion is known to be important to the magnetic field behaviour at many of\nthe intermediate densities and field strengths encountered during the\ngravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores into protostars, and yet its\nrole in the star formation process is not well-studied. This thesis describes a\nsemianalytic self-similar model of the collapse of rotating isothermal\nmolecular cloud cores with both Hall and ambipolar diffusion, presenting\nsimilarity solutions that demonstrate that the Hall effect has a profound\ninfluence on the dynamics of collapse.\n  ...\n  Hall diffusion also determines the strength of the magnetic diffusion and\ncentrifugal shocks that bound the pseudo and rotationally-supported discs, and\ncan introduce subshocks that further slow accretion onto the protostar. In\ncores that are not initially rotating Hall diffusion can even induce rotation,\nwhich could give rise to disc formation and resolve the magnetic braking\ncatastrophe. The Hall effect clearly influences the dynamics of gravitational\ncollapse and its role in controlling the magnetic braking and radial diffusion\nof the field would be worth exploring in future numerical simulations of star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 01:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-12"}

Authors have suggested that earthquake\ndynamics and neurodynamics can be analyzed within similar mathematical\nframeworks, a claim further supported by recent evidence. The purpose of this\npaper is to suggest a shift in emphasis from the large to the small in the\nsearch for a dynamical analogy between seizure and earthquake. Our analyses\nfocus on a single epileptic seizure generation and the activation of a single\nfault (earthquake) and not on the statistics of sequences of different seizures\nand earthquakes. A central property of the epileptic seizure / earthquake\ngeneration is the occurrence of coherent large-scale collective behaviour with\nvery rich structure, resulting from repeated nonlinear interactions among the\nconstituents of the system, respectively firing neurons and opening cracks.\nConsequently, in this paper, we apply the Tsallis nonextensive statistical\nmechanics as it proves an appropriate framework in order to investigate\nuniversal principles of their generation. For completeness reasons we also use\nentropic measures as well as tools from information theory. The obtained\nresults seems to support the claim that epileptic seizures can be considered as\n\"quakes on the brain\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 10:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-12"}
