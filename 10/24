The method is built in two steps.

Then, we prove the convergence of the approximation\nwhen the size of small jumps $\\eps$ goes to 0. In the second step, we obtain\nthe $L^p$ H\\\"older continuity of the solution of FBSDEBP and we construct two\nnumerical schemes for this FBSDEBP.

Combining these two steps leads to prove the convergence of numerical\nschemes to the solution of FBSDEL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2011 16:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-25"}

Residues in\nspatial proximity tend to co-evolve, yet attempts to invert the evolutionary\nrecord to identify these constraints and use them to computationally fold\nproteins have so far been unsuccessful. Here, we show that co-variation of\nresidue pairs, observed in a large protein family, provides sufficient\ninformation to determine 3D protein structure. Using a data-constrained maximum\nentropy model of the multiple sequence alignment, we identify pairs of\nstatistically coupled residue positions which are expected to be close in the\nprotein fold, termed contacts inferred from evolutionary information (EICs). To\nassess the amount of information about the protein fold contained in these\ncoupled pairs, we evaluate the accuracy of predicted 3D structures for proteins\nof 50-260 residues, from 15 diverse protein families, including a G-protein\ncoupled receptor. These structure predictions are de novo, i.e., they do not\nuse homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The\nresulting low C{\\alpha}-RMSD error range of 2.7-5.1{\\AA}, over at least 75% of\nthe protein, indicates the potential for predicting essentially correct 3D\nstructures for the thousands of protein families that have no known structure,\nprovided they include a sufficiently large number of divergent sample\nsequences.

First, the system consisting of stars, planets and\ncomets is treated self-consistently in our N-body simulations, rather than\napproximating the stellar encounters with the outer Solar System as hyperbolic\nfly-bys. Second, we have included the expulsion of the cluster gas, a feature\nthat was absent previously. Third, we have used several models for the initial\nconditions and density profile of the cluster -- either a Hernquist or Plummer\npotential -- and chose other parameters based on the latest observations of\nembedded clusters from the literature. {These other parameters result in the\nstars being on radial orbits and the cluster collapses.} Similar to previous\nstudies, in our simulations the inner Oort cloud is formed from comets being\nscattered by Jupiter and Saturn and having their pericentres decoupled from the\nplanets by perturbations from the cluster gas and other stars. We find that all\ninner Oort clouds formed in these clusters have an inner edge ranging from 100\nAU to a few hundred AU, and an outer edge at over 100\\,000 AU, with little\nvariation in these values for all clusters.

Here, we calculate the vertical profiles of the {\\it\nstationary} accretion flows (with radial and azimuthal components), and the\nprofiles of the large-scale, magnetic field taking into account the turbulent\nviscosity and diffusivity and the fact that the turbulence vanishes at the\nsurface of the disk.\n  Also, here we require that the radial accretion speed be zero at the disk's\nsurface and we assume that the ratio of the turbulent viscosity to the\nturbulent magnetic diffusivity is of order unity.

The critical number of stars at which gravothermal oscillations first\nappeared is found using a gas code. The nature of the oscillations is\ninvestigated and it is shown that the oscillations can be understood by\nfocusing on the behaviour of the heavier component, because of mass\nsegregation. It is argued that, during each oscillation, the re-collapse of the\ncluster begins at larger radii while the core is still expanding. This\nre-collapse can halt and reverse a gravothermally driven expansion. This\nmaterial outside the core contracts because it is losing energy both to the\ncool expanding core and to the material at larger radii. The core collapse\ntimes for each model are also found and discussed. For an appropriately chosen\ncase, direct N -body runs were carried out, in order to check the results\nobtained from the gas model, including evidence of the gravothermal nature of\nthe oscillations and the temperature inversion that drives the expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 11:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

During this observation, the source was mainly in the rho class\ncharacterized by bursts with a recurrence time of between 40 and 100 s. We\nidentify five segments in the burst structure and accumulate the average\nspectra of these segments during each satellite orbit. We present a detailed\nspectral analysis aimed at determining variations that occur during the burst\nand understanding the physical process that produces them. We compare MECS,\nHPGSPC, and PDS spectra with several models. Under the assumption that a single\nmodel is able to fit all spectra, we find that the combination of a\nmulti-temperature black-body disk and a hybrid corona is able to give a\nconsistent physical explanation of the source behaviour. Our measured\nvariations in KT_el, tau, KT_in, and R_in appear to be either correlated or\nanti-correlated with the count rate in the energy range 1.6-10 keV. The\nstrongest variations are detected along the burst segments: almost all\nparameters exhibit significant variations in the segments that have the highest\nfluxes (pulse) with the exception of R_in, which varies continuously and\nreaches a maximum just before the peak. The flux of the multi-temperature disk\nstrongly increases in the pulse and simultaneously the corona contribution is\nsignificantly reduced. The disk luminosity increases in the pulse and the\nR_in-T_in correlation can be most successfully interpreted in term of the slim\ndisk model. In addition, the reduction in the corona luminosity at the bursts\nmight represent the condensation of the corona onto the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 11:12:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 07:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In this thesis the\nentanglement of symmetric multipartite states is categorised, with a particular\nfocus on the pure multi-qubit case and the geometric measure of entanglement.\nAn essential tool for this analysis is the Majorana representation, a\ngeneralisation of the single-qubit Bloch sphere representation, which allows\nfor a unique representation of symmetric n qubit states by n points on the\nsurface of a sphere. Here this representation is employed to search for the\nmaximally entangled symmetric states of up to 12 qubits in terms of the\ngeometric measure, and an intuitive visual understanding of the upper bound on\nthe maximal symmetric entanglement is given. Furthermore, it will be seen that\nthe Majorana representation facilitates the characterisation of entanglement\nequivalence classes such as Stochastic Local Operations and Classical\nCommunication (SLOCC) and the Degeneracy Configuration (DC). It is found that\nSLOCC operations between symmetric states can be described by the Mobius\ntransformations of complex analysis, which allows for a clear visualisation of\nthe SLOCC freedoms and facilitates the understanding of SLOCC invariants and\nequivalence classes. In particular, explicit forms of representative states for\nall symmetric SLOCC classes of up to 5 qubits are derived. Well-known\nentanglement classification schemes such as the 4 qubit entanglement families\nor polynomial invariants are reviewed in the light of the results gathered\nhere, which leads to sometimes surprising connections. Some interesting links\nand applications of the Majorana representation to related fields of\nmathematics and physics are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 11:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-08"}

This high mass X-ray binary lies in the direction of the\nNorma arm, at an estimated distance of 13 kpc. During the observation, the\nsource showed strong variability exceeding two orders of magnitudes, never\nobserved before from this source. Its X-ray flux varied in the range from 0.1\ncounts/s to about 15 counts/s, with several bright flares of different\ndurations (from a few hundreds to a few thousands seconds) and sometimes with a\nquasi-periodic behavior. This finding supports the previous suggestion that\nIGRJ16418-4532 is a member of the SFXTs class. In our new observation we\nmeasured a pulse period of 1212+/-6 s, thus confirming that this binary\ncontains a slowly rotating neutron star. During the periods of low luminosity\nthe source spectrum is softer and more absorbed than during the flares. A soft\nexcess is present below 2 keV in the cumulative flares spectrum, possibly due\nto ionized wind material at a distance similar to the neutron star accretion\nradius. The kind of X-ray variability displayed by IGRJ16418-4532, its dynamic\nrange and time scale,together with the sporadic presence of quasi-periodic\nflaring, all are suggestive of a transitional accretion regime between pure\nwind accretion and full Roche lobe overflow. We discuss here for the first time\nthis hypothesis to explain the behavior of IGRJ16418-4532 and, possibly, of\nother SFXTs with short orbital periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 12:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In this paper, we report such a coronal blowout jet with\nhigh-resolution multi-wavelength and multi-angle observations taken from Solar\nDynamics Observatory, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and Big Bear\nSolar Observatory. For the first time, we find that a simultaneous bubble-like\nand a jet-like CMEs were dynamically related to the blowout jet that showed\ncool and hot components next to each other. Our observational results indicate\nthat: (1) the cool component was resulted from the eruption of the filament\ncontained within the jet's base arch, and it further caused the bubble-like\nCME; (2) the jet-like CME was associated with the hot component, which was the\noutward moving heated plasmas generated by the reconnection of the base arch\nand its ambient open field lines. On the other hand, bifurcation of the jet's\ncool component was also observed, which was resulted from the uncoupling of the\nerupting filament's two legs that were highly twisted at the very beginning.\nBased on these results, we propose a model to interpret the coronal blowout\njet, of which the external reconnection not only produces the jet-like CME but\nalso leads to the rising of the filament. Subsequently, internal reconnection\nstarts underneath the rising filament and thereby causes the bubble-like CME.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 14:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 05:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In particular, we wish to\ndetermine if a finite pressure current sheet will still involve a singular\ncurrent, and if so, what is the nature of the singularity. We use a full MHD\ncode, with the resistivity set to zero, so that reconnection is not allowed, to\nrun a series of experiments in which an X-point is perturbed and then is\nallowed to relax towards an equilibrium, via real, viscous damping forces.\nChanges to the magnitude of the perturbation and the initial plasma pressure\nare investigated systematically. The final state found in our experiments is a\n\"quasi-static\" equilibrium where the viscous relaxation has completely ended,\nbut the peak current density at the null increases very slowly following an\nasymptotic regime towards an infinite time singularity. Using a high grid\nresolution allows us to resolve the current structures in this state both in\nwidth and length. In comparison with the well known pressureless studies, the\nsystem does not evolve towards a thin current sheet, but concentrates the\ncurrent at the null and the separatrices. The growth rate of the singularity is\nfound to be tD, with 0 < D < 1. This rate depends directly on the initial\nplasma pressure, and decreases as the pressure is increased.

For the last thirty years, most of the studies on the relaxation of\nstressed magnetic fields in the solar environment have onlyconsidered the\nLorentz force, neglecting plasma contributions, and therefore, limiting every\nequilibrium to that of a force-free field. Aims. Here we begin a study of the\nnon-resistive evolution of finite beta plasmas and their relaxation to\nmagnetohydrostatic states, where magnetic forces are balanced by\nplasma-pressure gradients, by using a simple 2D scenario involving a\nhydromagnetic disturbance to a uniform magnetic field. The final equilibrium\nstate is predicted as a function of the initial disturbances, with aims to\ndemonstrate what happens to the plasma during the relaxation process and to see\nwhat effects it has on the final equilibrium state. Methods. A set of numerical\nexperiments are run using a full MHD code, with the relaxation driven by\nmagnetoacoustic waves damped by viscous effects. The numerical results are\ncompared with analytical calculations made within the linear regime, in which\nthe whole process must remain adiabatic. Particular attention is paid to the\nthermodynamic behaviour of the plasma during the relaxation. Results. The\nanalytical predictions for the final non force-free equilibrium depend only on\nthe initial perturbations and the total pressure of the system. It is found\nthat these predictions hold surprisingly well even for amplitudes of the\nperturbation far outside the linear regime. Conclusions. Including the effects\nof a finite plasma beta in relaxation experiments leads to significant\ndifferences from the force-free case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 15:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-25"}

The proposed theory may be found\npotential applications in seismic wave protection and structure health\nmonitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 02:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

For surfaces in C^4,\nwe obtain a L\\^e-Greuel formula expressing the Milnor number of the surface in\nterms of the second polar multiplicity and the Milnor number of a generic\nsection. We also relate the Milnor number with Ebeling and Gusein-Zade index of\nthe 1- form given by the differential of a generic linear projection defined on\nthe surface. To illustrate the results, in the last section we compute the\nMilnor number of some normal forms from A. Fr\\\"uhbis-Kr\\\"uger and A.
