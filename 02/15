The empirical mean is\nused as a reference as it is the constant that fits a given sequence within a\nminimal square error. With this reference, a reasonable prediction performance\nis the regret, namely the excess square-error over the reference loss, the\nempirical variance. The paper analyzes the tradeoff between the number of\nstates of the universal FSM and the attainable regret. It first studies the\ncase of a small number of states. A class of machines, denoted Degenerated\nTracking Memory (DTM), is defined and the optimal machine in this class is\nshown to be the optimal among all machines for small enough number of states.\nUnfortunately, DTM machines become suboptimal as the number of available states\nincreases. Next, the Exponential Decaying Memory (EDM) machine, previously used\nfor predicting binary sequences, is considered. While this machine has poorer\nperformance for small number of states, it achieves a vanishing regret for\nlarge number of states. Following that, an asymptotic lower bound of\nO(k^{-2/3}) on the achievable regret of any k-state machine is derived. This\nbound is attained asymptotically by the EDM machine. Furthermore, a new\nmachine, denoted the Enhanced Exponential Decaying Memory machine, is shown to\noutperform the EDM machine for any number of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 17:37:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2011 16:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 May 2011 09:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 20:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-07"}

The theory is shown to reproduce the hydrodynamic equations for the\ndensities of each species, the total momentum and the local temperature.

The tolerable agreement with Monte Carlos based\non LO DGLAP evolution indicates that there is no qualitative difference between\n`hard' and `soft' interactions; and that a perturbative QCD approach may be\nextended into the soft domain. However, in order to describe the data, these\nMonte Carlos need an additional infrared cutoff k_min with a value k_min ~ 2-3\nGeV which is not small, and which increases with collider energy. Here we\nexplain the physical origin of the large k_min. Using an alternative model\nwhich matches the `soft' high-energy hadron interactions smoothly on to\nperturbative QCD at small x, we demonstrate that this effective cutoff k_min is\nactually due to the strong absorption of low k_t partons. The model embodies\nthe main features of the BFKL approach, including the diffusion in transverse\nmomenta, lnk_t, and an intercept consistent with resummed next-to-leading log\ncorrections. Moreover, the model uses a two-channel eikonal framework, and\nincludes the contributions from the multi-Pomeron exchange diagrams, both\nnon-enhanced and enhanced.

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of 4d-VAR\n(four dimensional variational data assimilation) for exigent forecasting (XF)\nof severe storm precursors and to thereby characterize the probability of a\nworst-case scenario. 4d-VAR is designed to adjust the initial conditions (IC)\nof a numerical weather prediction model consistent with the uncertainty of the\nprior estimate of the IC while at the same time minimizing the misfit to\navailable observations. For XF the same approach is taken but instead of\nfitting observations, a measure of damage or loss or an equivalent proxy is\nmaximized or minimized. To accomplish this will require development of a\nspecialized cost function for 4d-VAR. When 4d-VAR solves the XF problem a\nby-product will be the value of the background cost function that provides a\nmeasure of the likelihood of occurrence of the forecast exigent conditions.\n4d-VAR has been previously applied to a special case of XF in hurricane\nmodification research. A summary of a case study of Hurricane Andrew (1992) is\npresented as a prototype of XF. The study of XF is expected to advance\nforecasting high impact weather events, refine methodologies for communicating\nwarning and potential impacts of exigent weather events to a threatened\npopulation, be extensible to commercially viable products, such as forecasting\nfreezes for the citrus industry, and be a useful pedagogical tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 18:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-15"}

We use a smaller set of clusters\nincluding 18 halos with masses above 5x10^13 M_sun/h to test the robustness of\nmass proxies against changing the physical processes included in simulations\n(thermal conduction, artificial viscosity, cooling and star formation, galactic\nwinds and AGN feedback). We find the M-Y_X scaling relation to be the least\nsensitive one to variations of the ICM physics, with its slope and redshift\nevolution close to the self-similar model predictions. The distribution of the\nscatter around the best-fitting relations is close to a log-normal one. M_gas\nhas the smallest scatter in mass, with values of sigma_lnM = 0.04-0.06,\ndepending on the physics included in the simulation, and with a mild dependence\non redshift. The M-T relation is the one with the largest scatter, with\nsigma_lnM > 0.1 at z=0, increasing to > 0.15 at z=1. The intrinsic scatter in\nthe M-Y_X relation is slightly larger than in the M-M_gas relation. These\nresults confirm that both Y_X and M_gas mass proxies are well suited for\ncosmological applications of future large X-ray surveys.

A fundamental question in Statistics, Data Analysis and\nClassification, is the prediction of the number of clusters in a dataset,\nusually established via internal validation measures. Despite the wealth of\ninternal measures available in the literature, new ones have been recently\nproposed, some of them specifically for microarray data. In this dissertation,\na study of internal validation measures is given, paying particular attention\nto the stability based ones. Indeed, this class of measures is particularly\nprominent and promising in order to have a reliable estimate the number of\nclusters in a dataset. For those measures, a new general algorithmic paradigm\nis proposed here that highlights the richness of measures in this class and\naccounts for the ones already available in the literature. Moreover, some of\nthe most representative validation measures are also considered. Experiments on\n12 benchmark datasets are performed in order to assess both the intrinsic\nability of a measure to predict the correct number of clusters in a dataset and\nits merit relative to the other measures. The main result is a hierarchy of\ninternal validation measures in terms of precision and speed, highlighting some\nof their merits and limitations not reported before in the literature. This\nhierarchy shows that the faster the measure, the less accurate it is. In order\nto reduce the time performance gap between the fastest and the most precise\nmeasures, the technique of designing fast approximation algorithms is\nsystematically applied. The end result is a speed-up of many of the measures\nstudied here that brings the gap between the fastest and the most precise\nwithin one order of magnitude in time, with no degradation in their prediction\npower.

We\ndevelop both numerical RHD calculations and a semi-analytical model that\ncharacterize radiative shocks in various physical conditions, for radiating or\nbarotropic fluids. Then, we perform 1D spherical collapse calculations of the\nfirst Larson's core, using a grey approximation for the opacity of the\nmaterial. We consider three different models for radiative transfer, namely:\nthe barotropic approximation, the FLD approximation and the more complete M1\nmodel. We investigate the characteristic properties of the collapse and of the\nfirst core formation. Comparison between the numerical results and our\nsemi-analytical model shows that this latter reproduces quite well the core\nproperties obtained with the numerical calculations. The accretion shock on the\nfirst Larson core is found to be supercritical, implying that all the accretion\nshock energy on the core is radiated away. The FLD approximation is found to\nagree quite well with the results based on the M1 model, and is thus\nappropriate to study the star formation process. In contrast, the barotropic\napproximation does not correctly describe the thermal properties of the gas\nduring the collapse. We show that a consistent treatment of radiation and\nhydrodynamics is mandatory to correctly handle the cooling of the gas during\nthe core formation and thus to obtain the correct mechanical and thermal\nproperties for this latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 22:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The asymptotic analysis\npredicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration $\\ell$ in\nthe asymptotic regime where $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. The analysis is similar in\nnature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze\niterative decoding algorithms.

In this paper, the embedding technique is analyzed from a\n\\emph{bounded distance decoding} (BDD) viewpoint.

In this retarded\ngravitation theory (RGT), the gravitational force depends upon both retarded\nposition and velocity, and the equations of motion are time-asymmetric retarded\nfunctional differential equations. We explicitly solve these equations, under\nsimplifying assumptions, for various NASA spacecraft. This shows that the\ndifferences from Newtonian gravity, though tiny within the solar system, are\njust appropriate to explain the flyby anomaly as a v/c effect due to earth's\nrotation. The differences can, however, be large in the case of a spiral\ngalaxy, and we show that the combined velocity drag from a large number of\nco-rotating stars enormously speeds up a test particle. Thus, the non-Newtonian\nbehaviour of rotation curves in a spiral galaxy may be explained as being due\nto velocity drag rather than dark matter. RGT can also be tested in the\nlaboratory. It necessitates a reappraisal of current laboratory methods of\ndetermining the Newtonian gravitational constant G. Since RGT makes no\nspeculative assumptions, its refutation would have serious implications across\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 02:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2011 03:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 21:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In this class of models, dark matter annihilates first into\nmetastable mediators, which subsequently decay into Standard Model particles.\nIf the mediators are long lived, they will propagate out from the dense solar\ncore before decaying. High energy neutrinos undergo absorption in the Sun. In\nthe standard scenario in which neutrinos are produced directly in the centre of\nthe Sun, absorption is relevant for E > 100 GeV, resulting in a significant\nsuppression of the neutrino spectrum beyond E ~ 1 TeV. In the secluded dark\nmatter scenario, the neutrino signal is greatly enhanced because neutrinos are\ninjected away from the core, at lower density. Since the solar density falls\nexponentially with radius, metastable mediators have a significant effect on\nthe neutrino flux, even for decay lengths which are small compared to the solar\nradius. Moreover, since neutrino detection cross sections grow with energy,\nthis enhancement of the high energy region of the neutrino spectrum would have\na large effect on overall event rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 04:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 02:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-20"}

Observations at high\nfrequencies are less affected by Faraday depolarization than those at lower\nfrequencies and are able to detect polarized emission from more distant\nGalactic regions. We attempt to perform a sensitive survey of the polarized\nemission from the Galactic disk at 6 cm wavelength. We made polarization\nobservations of the Galactic plane using the Urumqi 25-m telescope at 6 cm\ncovering the area of 60deg< l <129deg and |b|<5deg. Missing large-scale\nstructures in polarization were restored by extrapolation of the WMAP\npolarization data. We present the 6cm total intensity and linear polarization\nmaps of the surveyed region. We identify two new extended HII regions G98.3-1.6\nand G119.6+0.4 in this region. Numerous polarized patches and depolarization\nstructures are visible in the polarization maps. Depolarization along the\nperiphery of a few HII complexes was detected and can be explained by a Faraday\nscreen model. We discuss some prominent depolarization HII regions, which have\nregular magnetic fields of several $\\mu$G. Structure functions of U, Q and PI\nimages of the entire 6cm survey region of 10deg< l < 230deg exhibit much larger\nfluctuation power towards the inner Galaxy, which suggests a higher turbulence\nin the arm regions of the inner Galaxy. The Sino-German 6cm survey reveals new\nproperties of the diffuse magnetized interstellar medium. The survey is also\nvery useful for studying individual objects such as HII regions, which act as\nFaraday screens and have high rotation measures and therefore strong regular\nmagnetic fields inside the regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 06:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 00:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Earlier observations show omni-presence of\nquasi-periodic disturbances, travelling outward, which is believed to be caused\nby the ubiquitous presence of outward propagating waves. These waves, mostly of\ncompressional type, might provide the additional momentum and heat required for\nthe fast solar wind acceleration. It has been conjectured that these\ndisturbances are not due to waves but high speed plasma outflows, which are\ndifficult to distinguish using the current available techniques. With the\nunprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution of AIA, we search for these\nquasi-periodic disturbances in both plume and interplume regions of the polar\ncorona. We investigate their nature of propagation and search for a plausible\ninterpretation. We also aim to study their multi-thermal nature by using three\ndifferent coronal passbands of AIA. In almost all the locations chosen, in both\nplume and interplume regions we find the presence of propagating quasi-periodic\ndisturbances, of periodicities ranging from 10-30 min. These are clearly seen\nin two channels and in a few cases out to very large distances (~250 arcsec)\noff-limb, almost to the edge of the AIA field of view. The propagation speeds\nare in the range of 100-170 km/s. The average speeds are different for\ndifferent passbands and higher in interplume regions. Observed disturbances are\ninsensitive to changes in slit width. This indicates that a coherent mechanism\nis involved. In addition, the observed propagation speed varies between the\ndifferent passpands, implying that these quasi-periodic intensity disturbances\nare possibly due to magneto-acoustic waves. The propagation speeds in\ninterplume region are higher than in the plume region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 06:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-16"}

When the aspect-ratio is sufficiently\nlarge, this coexistence occurs in the form of alternately turbulent and laminar\noblique bands.

We argue that crunching FRW models with hyperbolic spatial\nsections are dual to semiclassical condensates in deformed de Sitter CFTs. De\nSitter-invariant condensates with a sharply defined energy scale are induced by\neffective negative-definite relevant or marginal operators, which may or may\nnot destabilize the CFT. We find this result by explicitly constructing a\n`complementarity map' for this model, given by a conformal transformation of\nthe de Sitter CFT into a static time-frame, which reveals the crunch as an\ninfinite potential-energy fall in finite time. We show that, quite generically,\nthe crunch is associated to a finite mass black hole if the de Sitter\nO(d,1)-invariance is an accidental IR symmetry, broken down to U(1)xO(d) in the\nUV. Any such regularization cuts off the eternity of de Sitter space-time.\nEquivalently, the dimension of the Hilbert space propagating into the crunch is\nfinite only when de Sitter is not eternal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 09:50:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 22:18:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 21:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-30"}

We test claims that the\nevolution of the solar surface magnetic field does not reproduce the observed\nTSI in cycle 23. We use sensitive, 60-minute averaged MDI magnetograms and\nquasi-simultaneous continuum images as an input to our SATIRE-S model and\ncalculate the TSI variation over cycle 23, sampled roughly twice-monthly. The\ncomputed TSI is then compared to the PMOD composite of TSI measurements and to\nthe data from two individual instruments, SORCE/TIM and UARS/ACRIM II, that\nmonitored the TSI during the declining phase of cycle 23 and over the previous\nminimum in 1996, respectively. Excellent agreement is found between the trends\nshown by the model and almost all sets of measurements. The only exception is\nthe early, i.e. 1996 to 1998, PMOD data. Whereas the agreement between the\nmodel and the PMOD composite over the period 1999-2009 is almost perfect, the\nmodelled TSI shows a steeper increase between 1996 and 1999 than implied by the\nPMOD composite. On the other hand, the steeper trend in the model agrees\nremarkably well with the ACRIM II data. A closer look at the VIRGO data, that\nmake the basis of the PMOD composite after 1996, reveals that only one of the\ntwo VIRGO instruments, the PMO6V, shows the shallower trend present in the\ncomposite, whereas the DIARAD measurements indicate a steeper trend. We\nconclude that (1) the sensitivity changes of the PMO6V radiometers within VIRGO\nduring the first two years have very likely not been correctly evaluated, and\nthat (2) the TSI variations over cycle 23 and the change in the TSI levels\nbetween the minima in 1996 and 2008 are consistent with the solar surface\nmagnetism mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 14:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In turn, it allowed us to model the oscillation\nspectrum, also giving feedback on the internal structure of the star.

Likewise, the number of residents in vulnerable areas that would occur\nin the scenario of sea level rise of 1 m is estimated. To do so, terrain\nelevation data of NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission is used, along with a\nproprietary algorithm that allows the reconstruction of the affected area. In\norder to estimate the land area digital image processing is used. These results\nare geo-referenced for comparison with human settlements in the regions of\ninterest. Results show that the total affected area corresponds to 1.26% of\nMexico national territorial extension and 3.18% of the Mexico total population.\n174 settlements with 1000 inhabitants or more are expected to be affected. The\nMexican state with the largest area affected is Tabasco with more than 21% of\nits territory, while the most vulnerable population will be Veracruz, with more\nthan 1 million people at risk if the scenario 1m increase would appear today.\nMeanwhile, 81.1% Quintana Roo population will be at zones with high flood risk.\nVulnerable settlements are listed and the maps corresponding to different\nMexican states are shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 17:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-22"}
