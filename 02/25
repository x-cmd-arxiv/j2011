To provide the foundation for such an investigation,\nStr\\\"omgren-Crawford uvbybeta photometry of open cluster target stars was\ncarried out to determine effective temperatures, luminosities, and therefore\ncluster memberships. In the course of three observing runs, uvbybeta photometry\nfor 168 target stars was acquired and transformed into the standard system by\nmeasurements of 117 standard stars.

The terms are not generated when\nthe scale invariance is maintained. Examples studied include the large $N$\nlimit of the $CP^{N-1}$ model in $(2+\\epsilon)$ dimensions, a 3D gauged\n$\\phi^6$ vector model and its supersymmetric extension.

BL Lac\nspectra are dominated by a smooth, power-law continuum which arises in a\nrelativistic jet.

Archival HST/STIS observations of PKS2155-304 (z=0.116)\nshow no Lya emission to a very low upper limit. Using the assumption that the\nbroad-line region (BLR) clouds are asymmetrically placed around the AGN, we use\nthese measured Lya emission features to constrain either the relativistic Gamma\nvalues for the ionizing continuum produced by the jet (in the\nionization-bounded case) or the mass of warm gas (in the density-bounded case).\nWhile realistic Gamma values can be obtained for all four cases, the values for\nMrk421 and PKS2155-304 are high enough to suggest that covering factors of\nbroad-line-region clouds of ~1-2% might be required to provide consistency with\nearlier values of Doppler boosting and viewing angles suggested for this class\nof BL Lacs. This discrepancy also exists in the case of M87, where the amount\nof Doppler boosting in our direction is expected to be minimal, again\nsuggestive of a small covering factor of broad-line-region clouds.

A key signature of the ejection is non-thermal\nradio emission. The level of this jet component at high frequencies is still\npoorly constrained. Aims: The X-ray binary and microquasar black hole candidate\nXTE J1550-564 exhibited a faint X-ray outburst in April 2003 during which it\nstayed in the X-ray low/hard state. We took optical and near-infrared (NIR)\nobservations with the ESO/NTT telescope during this outburst to disentangle the\nvarious contributions to the spectral energy distribution (SED) and investigate\nthe presence of a jet component. Methods: Photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations allowed us to construct an SED and also to produce a high\ntime-resolution lightcurve. Results: The SED shows an abrupt change of slope\nfrom the NIR domain to the optical. The NIR emission is attributed to\nnon-thermal synchrotron emission from the compact, self-absorbed jet that is\nknown to be present in the low/hard state. This is corroborated by the fast\nvariability, colours, lack of prominent spectral features and evidence for\nintrinsic polarisation. The SED suggests the jet break from the optically thick\nto the thin regime occurs in the NIR. Conclusions: The simultaneous optical-NIR\ndata allow an independent confirmation of jet emission in the NIR. The\ntransition to optically thin synchrotron occurs at NIR frequencies or below,\nwhich leads to an estimated characteristic size greater than 2x10^8cm and\nmagnetic field less than 5T for the jet base, assuming a homogeneous one-zone\nsynchrotron model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 18:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2011 14:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This\npaper considers the design of measurement matrices that achieve an optimality\ncriterion that depends on the coherence of the sensing matrix (CSM) and/or\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR). The first approach minimizes a performance\npenalty that is a linear combination of CSM and the inverse SIR. The second one\nimposes a structure on the measurement matrix and determines the parameters\ninvolved so that the SIR is enhanced. Depending on the transmit waveforms, the\nsecond approach can significantly improve SIR, while maintaining CSM comparable\nto that of the Gaussian random measurement matrix (GRMM). Simulations indicate\nthat the proposed measurement matrices can improve detection accuracy as\ncompared to a GRMM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 20:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

While\nprevious theoretical studies have focused on properties of the lens and source\npopulations, as well as cosmological effects such as dark energy, the impact of\ninitial conditions on the giant-arc abundance is relatively unexplored. Here,\nwe quantify the impact of non-Gaussian initial conditions with the local\nbispectrum shape on the predicted frequency of giant arcs. Using a\npath-integral formulation of the excursion set formalism, we extend a\nsemi-analytic model for calculating halo concentrations to the case of\nprimordial non-Gaussianity, which may be useful for applications outside of\nthis work. We find that massive halos tend to collapse earlier in models with\npositive f_NL, relative to the Gaussian case, leading to enhanced concentration\nparameters. The converse is true for f_NL < 0. In addition to these effects,\nwhich change the lensing cross sections, non-Gaussianity also modifies the\nabundance of supercritical clusters available for lensing. These combined\neffects work together to either enhance (f_NL > 0) or suppress (f_NL < 0) the\nprobability of giant-arc formation. Using the best value and 95% confidence\nlevels currently available from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, we\nfind that the giant-arc optical depth for sources at z_s~2 is enhanced by ~20%\nand ~45% for f_NL = 32 and 74 respectively. In contrast, we calculate a\nsuppression of ~5% for f_NL = -10. These differences translate to similar\nrelative changes in the predicted all-sky number of giant arcs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 21:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 22:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We quantify the influence of the\nlarge-scale stellar bar by constructing an analytical model of the evolution of\ngas particles in a barred potential. From this model gravitational torques and\nmass accumulation rates are computed. We compare our model-based gravitational\ntorque results with previous observationally-based ones. The model also shows\nthat the large-scale stellar bar is indeed the dominant force for driving the\ngas inward, to the starburst ring. Inside the ring itself a nuclear stellar\noval might play an important role. Detailed analysis of the CO gas kinematics\nthere shows that emission arises from two co-spatial, but kinematically\ndistinct components at several locations. The main emission component can\nalways be related to the overall bar-driven gas kinematics. The second\ncomponent exhibits velocities that are larger than expected for gas on stable\norbits, has a molecular gas mass of 1.8x10^6Msun, is very likely connected to\nthe nuclear stellar oval, and is consistent with inflowing motion towards the\nvery center.

A recent theoretical work [K. Ueno, Phys. Rev. E 68,\n(2003) 021603] to address the underlying instability that produces ripples is\nbased on the assumption of the absence of airflow around icicles.

These spectra show a narrow\noptical depth minimum at wavelengths around 2.87 microns. This minimum is\nlikely due to the Christiansen Effect, a reduction in the extinction of small\nparticles when their (complex) refractive index is close to that of the\nsurrounding medium. Simple Mie-scattering models demonstrate that the strength\nof this opacity dip is sensitive to the size distribution of particles between\n1 and 100 microns across. Furthermore, the spatial resolution of the\noccultation data is sufficient to reveal variations in the transmission spectra\nwithin and among these rings. For example, in both the Encke Gap ringlets and F\nring, the opacity dip weakens with increasing local optical depth, which is\nconsistent with the larger particles being concentrated near the cores of these\nrings. The strength of the opacity dip varies most dramatically within the F\nring; certain compact regions of enhanced optical depth lack an opacity dip and\ntherefore appear to have a greatly reduced fraction of grains in the few-micron\nsize range.Such spectrally-identifiable structures probably represent a subset\nof the compact optically-thick clumps observed by other Cassini instruments.\nThese variations in the ring's particle size distribution can provide new\ninsights into the processes of grain aggregation, disruption and transport\nwithin dusty rings. For example, the unusual spectral properties of the F-ring\nclumps could perhaps be ascribed to small grains adhering onto the surface of\nlarger particles in regions of anomalously low velocity dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 22:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2011 11:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-23"}

It is widely known how to infer the impact angle of\ndroplets on a surface from the elongation of their impact profiles. However,\nthe lack of velocity information makes finding the height of the origin from\nthe impact position and angle of individual drops not possible. From aggregate\nstatistics of the spatter and basic equations of projectile motion, we\nintroduce a reciprocal correlation plot that is effective when the polar launch\nangle is concentrated in a narrow range. The vertical coordinate depends on the\norientation of the spattered surface, and equals the tangent of the impact\nangle for a level surface. When the horizontal plot coordinate is twice the\nreciprocal of the impact distance, we can infer the source height as the slope\nof the data points in the reciprocal correlation plot. If the distribution of\nlaunch angles is not narrow, failure of the method is evident in the lack of\nlinear correlation. We perform a number of experimental trials, as well as\nnumerical calculations and show that the height estimate is insensitive to\naerodynamic drag. Besides its possible relevance for crime investigation,\nreciprocal-plot analysis of spatter may find application to volcanism and other\ntopics and is most immediately applicable for undergraduate science and\nengineering students in the context of crime-scene analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2011 00:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 21:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The WEIRD feedback\nmechanism does operate under realistic conditions, although it can be masked\nand diminished by a variety of other forcing mechanisms.

On the other hand, since the turbulent flow characteristically appears in\nthe form of spatially localized structures (e.g., eddies) filling the flow\nfield, a tendency to occupy such a structured state of the flow cannot be ruled\nout as a driving force for turbulent transition. To examine this possibility,\nwe propose a simple analytical model that treats the flow as a collection of\nlocalized spatial structures, each of which consists of elementary cells in\nwhich the behavior of the particles (atoms or molecules) is uncorrelated. This\nallows us to introduce the Reynolds number, associating it with the ratio\nbetween the total phase volume for the system and that for the elementary cell.\nUsing the principle of maximum entropy to calculate the most probable size\ndistribution of the localized structures, we show that as the Reynolds number\nincreases, the elementary cells group into the localized structures, which\nsuccessfully explains turbulent transition and some other general properties of\nturbulent flows. We show that the basic assumptions underlying the model, i.e.\nthat the particles are indistinguishable and elementary volumes of phase space\nexist in which the state of the particles is uncertain, are involved in the\nderivation of the Navier-Stokes equation. Taking into account that the model\ncaptures essential features of turbulent flows, this suggests that the driving\nforce for the turbulent transition is basically the same as in the present\nmodel, i.e. the tendency of the system to occupy a statistically dominant state\nplays a key role. The instability of the flow at high Reynolds numbers can then\nbe a mechanism to initiate structural rearrangement of the flow to find this\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2011 04:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 02:34:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 04:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-27"}

The model then describes the observed\nrandomness in sunspot number on top of this driver function.

This model has a very rich transient, that has been used to\nmodel several aspects of elections, but its stationary states are always\nconsensus states. In order to model more complex behaviours we have, in a\nrecent work, introduced the idea of biases and prejudices to the Sznajd model,\nby generalizing the bounded confidence rule that is common to many continuous\nopinion models. In that work we have found that the mean-field version of this\nmodel (corresponding to a complete network) allows for stationary states where\nnon-interacting opinions survive, but never for the coexistence of interacting\nopinions. In the present work, we provide networks that allow for the\ncoexistence of interacting opinions. Moreover, we show that the model does not\nbecome inactive, that is, the opinions keep changing, even in the stationary\nregime.

MORIS is mounted on the 3-m Infrared\nTelescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, HI. Its primary component is an Andor\niXon camera, a nearly 60 arcsec square field of view with high quantum\nefficiency, low read noise, low dark current, and full-frame readout rates\nranging from as slow as desired to a maximum of between 3.5 Hz and 35 Hz\n(depending on the mode; read noise of 6e-/pixel and 49 e-/pixel with\nelectron-multiplying gain=1, respectively). User-selectable binning and\nsubframing can increase the cadence to a few hundred Hz. An\nelectron-multiplying mode can be employed for photon counting, effectively\nreducing the read noise to sub-electron levels at the expense of dynamic range.\nData cubes, or individual frames, can be triggered to several nanosecond\naccuracy using the Global Positioning System. MORIS is mounted on the\nside-facing exit window of SpeX (Rayner et al. 2003), allowing simultaneous\nnear-infrared and visible observations. Here we describe the components, setup,\nand measured characteristics of MORIS. We also report results from the first\nscience observations: the 24 June 2008 stellar occultation by Pluto and an\nextrasolar planetary transit by XO-2b. The Pluto occultation, of a 15.8 R\nmagnitude star, has signal-to-noise ratio of 35 per atmospheric scale height\nand a midtime error of 0.32 s. The XO-2b transit reaches photometric precision\nof 0.5 millimagnitudes in 2 minutes and has a midtime timing precision of 23\nseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2011 14:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Better polarization purity requires a flatter phase response over\nincreasingly wide bandwidth, which is most easily achieved with digital\ntechniques. They offer the ability to form circular polarization with perfect\npolarization purity over arbitrarily wide fractional bandwidths, due to the\nease of introducing a perfect quadrature phase shift. Further, the rapid\nimprovements in field programmable gate arrays provide the high processing\npower, low cost, portability and reconfigurability needed to make practical the\nimplementation of the formation of circular polarization digitally. Aims: Here\nwe explore the performance of a circular polarizer implemented with digital\ntechniques. Methods: We designed a digital circular polarizer in which the\nintermediate frequency signals from a receiver with native linear polarizations\nwere sampled and converted to circular polarization. The frequency-dependent\ninstrumental phase difference and gain scaling factors were determined using an\ninjected noise signal and applied to the two linear polarizations to equalize\nthe transfer characteristics of the two polarization channels. This\nequalization was performed in 512 frequency channels over a 512 MHz bandwidth.\nCircular polarization was formed by quadrature phase shifting and summing the\nequalized linear polarization signals.

Algebraic constructions are of particular interest because they\nadmit analytical designs and simple, practical hardware implementation. Also,\nthe recently proposed quadratic permutation polynomial (QPP) based interleavers\nby Sun and Takeshita (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Jan. 2005) provide excellent\nperformance for short-to-medium block lengths, and have been selected for the\n3GPP LTE standard. In this work, we derive some upper bounds on the best\nachievable minimum distance dmin of QPP-based conventional binary turbo codes\n(with tailbiting termination, or dual termination when the interleaver length N\nis sufficiently large) that are tight for larger block sizes. In particular, we\nshow that the minimum distance is at most 2(2^{\\nu +1}+9), independent of the\ninterleaver length, when the QPP has a QPP inverse, where {\\nu} is the degree\nof the primitive feedback and monic feedforward polynomials. However, allowing\nthe QPP to have a larger degree inverse may give strictly larger minimum\ndistances (and lower multiplicities). In particular, we provide several QPPs\nwith an inverse degree of at least three for some of the 3GPP LTE interleaver\nlengths giving a dmin with the 3GPP LTE constituent encoders which is strictly\nlarger than 50. For instance, we have found a QPP for N=6016 which gives an\nestimated dmin of 57. Furthermore, we provide the exact minimum distance and\nthe corresponding multiplicity for all 3GPP LTE turbo codes (with dual\ntermination) which shows that the best minimum distance is 51. Finally, we\ncompute the best achievable minimum distance with QPP interleavers for all 3GPP\nLTE interleaver lengths N <= 4096, and compare the minimum distance with the\none we get when using the 3GPP LTE polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2011 15:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The optical properties of the dust\nparticles responsible for initiating the outflow affect the stellar spectra in\ntwo ways: (i) indirectly, through their influence on the dynamical structure of\nthe atmosphere/envelope and the resulting molecular features, and (ii)\ndirectly, by changes of the spectral energy distribution due to absorption and\nscattering on dust grains. The qualitative differences in the energy\ndistributions of C-type and M-type AGB stars in the visual and near-infrared\nregions suggest that the dust particles in oxygen rich atmospheres are\nrelatively transparent to radiation.
