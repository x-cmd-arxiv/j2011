In\naddition to the Bogoliubov mode, this superfluid phase has two spin\nexcitations, namely, the gapless transverse spin wave and the quadrupolar mode\nwith a finite excitation gap. In the mean-field theory at T=0, we examine how\nthese collective modes tunnel through a barrier potential that couples to the\nlocal density of particles. In the presence of supercurrent with a finite\nmomentum $q$, while the Bogoliubov mode shows the so-called anomalous tunneling\nbehavior (which is characterized by perfect transmission) in the low energy\nlimit, the transverse spin-wave transmits perfectly only when the momentum $k$\nof this mode coincides with $\\pm q$. At $k=\\pm q$, the wave function of this\nspin wave has the same form as the condensate wave function in the current\ncarrying state, so that the mechanism of this perfect transmission is found to\nbe the same as tunneling of supercurrent. Using this fact, the perfect\ntransmission of the spin wave is proved for a generic barrier potential. We\nshow that such perfect transmission does not occur in the quadrupolar mode.\nFurther, we consider the effects of potentials breaking U(1) and spin rotation\nsymmetries on the transmission properties of excitations. Our results would be\nuseful for understanding excitation properties of spinor BECs, as well as the\nanomalous tunneling phenomenon in Bose superfluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 16:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

In this paper, we consider\nanother possibility for achieving entanglement between nodes: using mobile\nelectron spins as mediators of the interaction between static qubits at each\nnode. A strong interaction between electrons makes it feasible to couple the\nflying electron with the static electron. However, since the electrons easily\ninteract with the environment, error accumulation during the entanglement\noperation could be more severe than with the other strategy using photons as\nflying qubits. We introduce a new scheme especially designed to minimize such\nerror accumulation by using several distillation protocols. The conclusion is\nthat a high fidelity entanglement operation can be constructed even under the\neffect of typical imperfections, and this suggestion therefore offers a\nfeasible route for the realization of distributed quantum information\nprocessing in solid state systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 16:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-16"}

The arguments are\nillustrated for the case of a thin film of LaAlO$_3$ over SrTiO$_3$ in the\nabsence of free carriers, for which the net charge is exactly 0.5$e$ per\ninterface formula unit, if the polarisation response in both materials is\nreferred to zero bulk values.

The system\nsetup is the wiretap channel model where transmitted data traverse through\nindependent packet erasure channels with public feedback for authenticated ARQ\n(Automatic Repeat reQuest).

Both the tides the planet raises on the star and vice versa are\nimportant and dissipation efficiencies ranging over four orders of magnitude\nare being used. In addition, the discovery of extrasolar planets extremely\nclose to their stars has made it clear that the estimates of the tidal quality\nfactor, Q, of the stars based on Jupiter and its satellite system and on main\nsequence binary star observations are too low, resulting in lifetimes for the\nclosest planets orders of magnitude smaller than their age. We argue that those\nestimates of the tidal dissipation efficiency are not applicable for stars with\nspin periods much longer than the extrasolar planets' orbital period. We\naddress the problem by applying our own values for the dissipation efficiency\nof tides, based on our numerical simulations of externally perturbed volumes of\nstellar-like convection. The range of dissipation we find for main-sequence\nstars corresponds to stellar $Q_*$ of $10^8$ to $3{\\times}10^9$. The derived\norbit lifetimes are comparable to, or much longer than the ages of the observed\nextrasolar planetary systems.

A finite\ndifference formula approximates the $m$-th derivative $f^{(m)}(0)$ as $\\sum\nw_{k}f(z_{k})$, with $w_{k}$ being the weights. We derive an algorithm for\nfinding the weights $w_{k}$ which is an improvement of an algorithm of Fornberg\n(\\emph{Mathematics of Computation}, vol. 51 (1988), p. 699-706). This algorithm\nuses fewer arithmetic operations than that of Fornberg by a factor of\n$4/(5m+5)$ while being equally accurate. The algorithm that we derive computes\nfinite difference weights accurately even when $m$, the order of the\nderivative, is as high as 16. In addition, the algorithm generalizes easily to\nthe efficient computation of spectral differentiation matrices.\n  The order of accuracy of the finite difference formula for $f^{(m)}(0)$ with\ngrid points $hz_{k}$, $1\\leq k\\leq N$, is typically $\\mathcal{O}(h^{N-m})$.\nHowever, the most commonly used finite difference formulas have an order of\naccuracy that is higher than the typical.

Projection analysis - a recently introduced\ntechnique - shows that the distributed packetized RLNC protocol achieves\n(order) optimal and perfectly pipelined information dissemination in many\nsettings. In the original approach to RNLC intermediate nodes code together all\navailable information. This requires intermediate nodes to keep considerable\ndata available for coding. Moreover, it results in a coding complexity that\ngrows linearly with the size of this data. While this has been identified as a\nproblem, approaches that combine queuing theory and network coding have\nheretofore not provided a succinct representation of the memory needs of\nnetwork coding at intermediates nodes.\n  This paper shows the surprising result that, in all settings with a\ncontinuous stream of data, network coding continues to perform optimally even\nif only one packet per node is kept in active memory and used for computations.\nThis leads to an extremely simple RLNC protocol variant with drastically\nreduced requirements on computational and memory resources. By extending the\nprojection analysis, we show that in all settings in which the RLNC protocol\nwas proven to be optimal its finite memory variant performs equally well. In\nthe same way as the original projection analysis, our technique applies in a\nwide variety of network models, including highly dynamic topologies that can\nchange completely at any time in an adversarial fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 23:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-17"}

Lower solar luminosity in the past means that less energy\nwas absorbed on Earth (a forcing of -50 Wm-2 during the late Archean), but\ngeological evidence points to the Earth being at least as warm as it is today,\nwith only very occasional glaciations. We perform radiative calculations on a\nsingle global mean atmospheric column. We select a nominal set of three\nlayered, randomly overlapping clouds, which are both consistent with observed\ncloud climatologies and reproduce the observed global mean energy budget of\nEarth. By varying the fraction, thickness, height and particle size of these\nclouds we conduct a wide exploration of how changed clouds could affect\nclimate, thus constraining how clouds could contribute to resolving the FYSP.\nLow clouds reflect sunlight but have little greenhouse effect. Removing them\nentirely gives a~forcing of +25 Wm-2 whilst more modest reduction in their\nefficacy gives a forcing of +10 to +15 Wm-2. For high clouds, the greenhouse\neffect dominates. It is possible to generate +50 Wm-2 forcing from enhancing\nthese, but this requires making them 3.5 times thicker and 14 K colder than the\nstandard high cloud in our nominal set and expanding their coverage to 100% of\nthe sky. Such changes are not credible. More plausible changes would generate\nno more that +15 Wm-2 forcing. Thus neither fewer low clouds nor more high\nclouds can provide enough forcing to resolve the FYSP. Decreased surface albedo\ncan contribute no more than +5 Wm-2 forcing. Some models which have been\napplied to the FYSP do not include clouds at all. These overestimate the\nforcing due to increased CO2 by 20 to 25% when CO2 is 0.01 to 0.1 bar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 00:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Radiation pressure theory has still very weak observational\nbackground in any of these sources.

We performed three real-time\ne-VLBI observations of PMN J0948+0022 at 22 GHz, using a global array including\ntelescopes in Europe, East Asia, and Australia. These are the first e-VLBI\nscience observations ever carried out with a global array, reaching a maximum\nbaseline length of 12458 km. The observations were part of a large\nmultiwavelength campaign in 2009. The source is detected at all three epochs.\nThe structure is dominated by a bright component, more compact than 55\nmicroarcsec, with a fainter component at a position angle theta~ 35deg.\nRelativistic beaming is required by the observed brightness temperature of\n3.4x10^11 K. Polarization is detected at a level of about 1%. The parameters\nderived by the VLBI observations, in addition to the broad-band properties,\nconfirm that PMN J0948+0022 is similar to flat spectrum radio quasars. Global\ne-VLBI is a reliable and promising technique for future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 08:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-26"}

On the other hand, the ABJM model was\nproposed as a low-energy description of multiple M2-branes in the static gauge.\nIt is natural that an M2-brane is also unstable in this gauge if we believe the\nphysical picture in the light-cone gauge. In order to examine this, we\nconstruct a BPS solution explicitly both in the Nambu-Goto action of a\nsupermembrane in the static gauge and in the U(1){\\times}U(1) ABJM model, which\nrepresents intersecting M2-branes. Since this configuration is regarded as a\nsingle M2-brane emitting another one, we study the instability of an M2-brane\nby analyzing fluctuations around it.

In contrast, the validity of effective low\nenergy theories is usually limited to the vicinity of a high symmetry point in\nthe BZ. We derive a general criterion under which the control parameter of a\ntopological phase transition localizes the topological defect in an arbitrarily\nsmall neighbourhood of a single point in $k$-space upon approaching its\ncritical value. Such a local phase transition is associated with a Dirac-like\ngap closing point, whereas a flat band transition is not localized in\n$k$-space. This mechanism and its limitations are illustrated with the help of\nexperimentally relevant examples such as HgTe/CdTe quantum wells and bilayer\ngraphene nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 10:03:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 12:16:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2012 22:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-16"}

The MMV problems had\nbeen traditionally addressed either by sensor array signal processing or\ncompressive sensing. However, recent breakthrough in this area such as\ncompressive MUSIC (CS-MUSIC) or subspace-augumented MUSIC (SA-MUSIC) optimally\ncombines the compressive sensing (CS) and array signal processing such that\n$k-r$ supports are first found by CS and the remaining $r$ supports are\ndetermined by generalized MUSIC criterion, where $k$ and $r$ denote the\nsparsity and the independent snapshots, respectively. Even though such hybrid\napproach significantly outperforms the conventional algorithms, its performance\nheavily depends on the correct identification of $k-r$ partial support by\ncompressive sensing step, which often deteriorate the overall performance. The\nmain contribution of this paper is, therefore, to show that as long as $k-r+1$\ncorrect supports are included in any $k$-sparse CS solution, the optimal $k-r$\npartial support can be found using a subspace fitting criterion, significantly\nimproving the overall performance of CS-MUSIC.

We also study the dependence of structural parameters on\nmorphological appearance. EROs that are either compact or show a distinct bulge\ncomponent have smaller median effective radii (1.22+-0.14 kpc and 3.31+-0.53\nkpc) than disc dominated (5.50+-0.51 kpc) or possible irregular galaxies or\nmerger candidates (4.92+-0.14 kpc).

We\nuncover in both compounds a distinct rearrangement of the antiferromagnetically\nordered Sm-moments near $35-40$~T.

Several distinct regimes are put in\nevidence. For poorly substituted (mainly hydrophilic) copolymers formation of\nmicelles is observed, either isolated or connected by the hydrophilic moieties,\ndepending on concentration and chain length. For more highly substituted chains\nlarger tubular hydrophobic structures appear which, at higher concentration,\njoin to form extended hydrophobic cores.

For the poorly\nsubstituted chains the gel consists of micelles cross-linked by hydrophilic\nblocks whereas for the highly substituted copolymers the extended hydrophobic\ncores form the gelling network.

Such phase transitions have been widely\nstudied in ionic gels, where the mechanism relies on self-attraction or\nelasticity of a network. We find here that non-ideal behavior of ions in\naqueous solution can in theory drive phase transitions without a\nself-attracting or elastic network. We represent non-ideality by a\nDebye-H\\\"uckel-like power-law activity, or correlation free energy, and retain\na mechanical self-repulsion to avoid runaway collapse due to the non-ideal\nterm. Within this model we find a continuous line of gas-liquid-type critical\npoints, connecting a purely monovalent, divalent-sensitive critical point at\none extreme with a divalent, monovalent-sensitive critical point at the other.\nAn alternative representation of the Landau functional handles the second case.\nWe include a formula for electrical potential, which may be a convenient proxy\nfor critically varying volume. Our relatively simple mean-field formulation may\nfacilitate explorations of tunable critical sensitivity in areas such as ion\ndetection technology and biological osmotic control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 13:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-17"}

I relate this\nview with Kauffman's 'Fourth Law of Thermodynamics', which I interprete as a\nproposition about the accumulation of information in evolutionary processes.\nThe concept of physical work is expanded to including work directed at the\ncapacity to work: I offer a twofold specification of Kauffman's concept of an\n'autonomous agent', one as a 'self-referential heat engine', and the other in\nterms of physiosemeiosis, which is a naturalized application of Peirce's theory\nof signs. The conjunction of these three theoretical sources, Maximum Entropy,\nKauffman's Fourth Law, and physiosemeiosis, shows that the Kleidon restatement\nof the Gaia hypothesis is equivalent to the proposition that the biosphere is\ngenerating, processing and storing information, thus directly treating\ninformation as a physical phenomenon. There is a fundamental ontological\ncontinuity between the biological processes and the human economy, as both are\nseen as information processing and entropy producing systems.

Here, we perform all-atom steered\nmolecular dynamics simulations on 15 cystine knot proteins and determine their\nresistance to stretching. In agreement with previous studies within a coarse\ngrained structure based model, the level of resistance is found to be\nsubstantially higher than in proteins in which the mechanical clamp operates\nthrough shear. The large stretching forces arise through formation of the\ncystine slipknot mechanical clamp and the resulting steric jamming. We\nelucidate the workings of such a clamp in an atomic detail. We also study the\nbehavior of five top strength proteins with the shear-based mechanostability in\nwhich no jamming is involved. We show that in the atomic model, the jamming\nstate is relieved by moving one amino acid at a time and there is a choice in\nthe selection of the amino acid that advances the first.

By treating the inter-cluster potential, in addition\nto the interactions, as a perturbation, it is shown that the CPT can be\nreformulated as an all-order re-summation of diagrams within standard\nweak-coupling perturbation theory where vertex corrections are neglected. This\nreformulation is shown to allow for a straightforward generalization of the CPT\nto the general non-equilibrium case using contour-ordered Green's functions.\nSolving the resulting generalized CPT equation on the discretized\nKeldysh-Matsubara time contour, the transient dynamics of an essentially\narbitrary initial pure or mixed state can be traced. In this way, the\ntime-dependent expectation values of one-particle observables can be obtained\nwithin an approximation that neglects spatial correlations beyond the extension\nof the reference cluster. The necessary computational effort is very moderate.\nA detailed discussion and simple test calculations are presented to demonstrate\nthe strengths and the shortcomings of the proposed approach. The\nnon-equilibrium CPT is systematic and is controlled in principle by the inverse\ncluster size. It interpolates between the non-interacting and the atomic or\ndecoupled-cluster limit which are recovered exactly and is found to predict the\ncorrect dynamics at very short times in a general non-trivial case. The effects\nof initial-state correlations on the subsequent dynamics and the necessity to\nextend the Keldysh contour by the imaginary Matsubara branch are analyzed\ncarefully and demonstrated numerically. It is furthermore shown that the\napproach can describe the dissipation of spin and charge to an uncorrelated\nbath with an essentially arbitrary number of degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 14:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-27"}

Looking to\nthe future, the major upgrades to LIGO (Advanced LIGO), Virgo (Advanced Virgo),\nLCGT and GEO600 (GEO-HF) will be completed over the coming years, which will\ncreate a network of detectors with significantly improved sensitivity required\nto detect gravitational waves. Beyond this, the concept and design of possible\nfuture \"third generation\" gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein\nTelescope (ET), will be discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 14:54:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 11:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In this scenario,\nthe magnetic field has to exceed a threshold value before it becomes buoyant\nand emerges through the whole convection zone. We follow the evolution of a\nrandom seed magnetic field with the aim of study under what conditions it is\npossible to excite the dynamo instability and whether the dynamo generated\nmagnetic field becomes buoyantly unstable and emerges to the surface as\nexpected in the flux-tube context. We perform numerical simulations of\ncompressible turbulent convection that include a vertical shear layer. Like the\nsolar tachocline, the shear is located at the interface between convective and\nstable layers. We find that shear and convection are able to amplify the\ninitial magnetic field and form large-scale elongated magnetic structures. The\nmagnetic field strength depends on several parameters such as the shear\namplitude, the thickness and location of the shear layer, and the magnetic\nReynolds number ($\\Rm$). Whenever the toroidal magnetic field reaches\namplitudes greater a threshold value which is close to the equipartition value,\nit becomes buoyant and rises into the convection zone where it expands and\nforms mushroom shape structures. Some events of emergence, i.e. those with the\nlargest amplitudes of the initial field, are able to reach the very uppermost\nlayers of the domain. These episodes are able to modify the convective pattern\nforming either broader convection cells or convective eddies elongated in the\ndirection of the field. However, in none of these events the field preserves\nits initial structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 15:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-25"}
