Here, we consider binary 3D-TCs while the original work of Berrou et\nal. considered double-binary codes. In the first part of the paper, the minimum\ndistance properties are analyzed from an ensemble perspective, both in the\nfinite-length regime and in the asymptotic case of large block lengths. In\nparticular, we analyze the asymptotic weight distribution of 3D-TCs and show\nnumerically that their typical minimum distance dmin may, depending on the\nspecific parameters, asymptotically grow linearly with the block length, i.e.,\nthe 3D-TC ensemble is asymptotically good for some parameters. In the second\npart of the paper, we derive some useful upper bounds on the dmin when using\nquadratic permutation polynomial (QPP) interleavers with a quadratic inverse.\nFurthermore, we give examples of interleaver lengths where an upper bound\nappears to be tight. The best codes (in terms of estimated dmin) obtained by\nrandomly searching for good pairs of QPPs for use in the 3D-TC are compared to\na probabilistic lower bound on the dmin when selecting codes from the 3D-TC\nensemble uniformly at random. This comparison shows that the use of designed\nQPP interleavers can improve the dmin significantly. For instance, we have\nfound a (6144,2040) 3D-TC with an estimated dmin of 147, while the\nprobabilistic lower bound is 69. Higher rates are obtained by puncturing\nnonsystematic bits, and optimized periodic puncturing patterns for rates 1/2,\n2/3, and 4/5 are found by computer search. Finally, we give iterative decoding\nthresholds, computed from an extrinsic information transfer chart analysis, and\npresent simulation results on the additive white Gaussian noise channel to\ncompare the error rate performance to that of conventional turbo codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 16:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

A detailed symmetry-mode\nanalysis reveals that condensation of three soft modes -Delta_2(B2u), X1+(B2u)\nand X1+(A)- acting on the oxygen atoms accounts for the structural\ntransformation.

The X1+ modes are responsible for the tetragonal superlattice\n(1/2,1/2,0)-type reflections in agreement with a checkerboard ordering of two\ndifferent Mn sites. A strong enhancement of the scattered intensity has been\nobserved for these superlattice reflections close to the Mn K edge, which could\nbe ascribed to some degree of charge disproportion between the two Mn sites of\nabout 0.15 electrons.

The constant-modulus phase modulation scheme ensures a\nfixed transmit power, robust estimation across several sensing noise\ndistributions, as well as an SNR estimate that requires a single set of\ntransmissions from the sensors to the fusion center, unlike the\namplify-and-forward approach. The performance of the estimators of the mean and\nvariance are evaluated in terms of asymptotic variance, which is used to\nevaluate the performance of the SNR estimator in the case of Gaussian, Laplace\nand Cauchy sensing noise distributions. For each sensing noise distribution,\nthe optimal phase transmission parameters are also determined. The asymptotic\nrelative efficiency of the mean and variance estimators is evaluated. It is\nshown that among the noise distributions considered, the estimators are\nasymptotically efficient only when the noise distribution is Gaussian.\nSimulation results corroborate analytical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 18:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The argument\nsupporting this expectation is that in some conditions attained in the core of\nthese objects, the typical De Broglie wavelength associated with helium nuclei\nis of the order of the mean distance between neighboring nuclei. In these\nconditions the system should depart from classical behavior showing quantum\neffects. As helium nuclei are bosons, they are expected to condense.\n  In order to explore the possibility of detecting the Bose-Einstein\ncondensation in the evolution of helium white dwarfs we have computed a set of\nmodels for a variety of stellar masses and values of the condensation\ntemperature. We do not perform a detailed treatment of the condensation process\nbut mimic it by suppressing the nuclei contribution to the equation of state by\napplying an adequate function. As the cooling of white dwarfs depends on\naverage properties of the whole stellar interior, this procedure should be\nsuitable for exploring the departure of the cooling process from that predicted\nby the standard treatment.\n  We find that the Bose-Einstein condensation has noticeable, but not dramatic\neffects on the cooling process only for the most massive white dwarfs\ncompatible with a helium dominated interior (\\approx 0.50 M_\\odot) and very low\nluminosities (say, Log(L/L_\\odot) < -4.0). These facts lead us to conclude that\nit seems extremely difficult to find observable signals of the Bose-Einstein\ncondensation.\n  Recently, it has been suggested that the population of helium white dwarfs\ndetected in the globular cluster NGC 6397 is a good candidate for detecting\nsignals of the Bose-Einstein condensation. We find that these stars have masses\ntoo low and are too bright to have an already condensed interior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 18:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Although there is\nvariation in the appearance of the waves with time, they do not disappear and\nreform recurrently, as seen in other cases described in the literature. We also\npresent an analytic theory that can account for the wave structure, not as\npropagating transients, nor as a fixed pattern propagating through the disc.\nWhile these waves propagate through the disc, they are maintained by the\ncoherent oscillations initiated by the impulsive disturbance. Specifically, the\nanalytic theory suggests that they are caustic waves in ensembles of stars\npursuing correlated epicyclic orbits after the disturbance. This theory is an\nextension of that developed by Struck and collaborators for colliding ring\ngalaxies.\n  The models suggest that this type of wave may persist for a couple of Gyr.,\nand galaxy interactions occur on comparable timescales, so waves produced by\nthe mechanism may be well represented in observed spirals. In particular, this\nmechanism can account for the tightly wound, and presumably long-lived spirals,\nseen in some nearby early-type galaxies. These spirals are also likely to be\ncommon in groups and clusters, where fast encounters between galaxies occur\nrelatively frequently. However, as the spirals become tightly wound, and evolve\nto modest amplitudes, they may be difficult to resolve unless they are nearby.\nNonetheless, the effect may be one of several processes that result from galaxy\nharassment, and via wave-enhanced star formation contribute to the\nButcher-Oemler effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 18:48:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 20:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 16:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-16"}

They represent the chromospheric radiative\nenergy losses presumably related to basal heating by the dissipation of\nacoustic waves, plus a highly variable contribution due to magnetic activity.\nThanks to the large sample size, we find a very well defined lower limit, the\nbasal chromospheric Mg II h+k line flux of cool giant chromospheres, as a\nfunction of T_eff. A total of 16 giants were observed several times, over a\nperiod of up to 20 years. Their respective minimal Mg II h+k line fluxes\nconfirm the basal flux limit very well because none of their emissions dip\nbeneath the empirically deduced basal flux line representative for the overall\nsample.

Within its uncertainties, this is almost the same relation as has been\nfound in the past for the geometrically much thinner chromospheres of main\nsequence stars. Concerning any residual dependence of the basal flux on the\nsurface gravity it can be stated that over a gravity range of more than four\norders of magnitude (main-sequence stars to supergiants), the basal flux does\nnot appear to vary by more than a factor of 2. These findings are in good\nagreement with the predictions by previous hydrodynamic models of acoustic wave\npropagation and energy dissipation, as well as with earlier empirical\ndeterminations.

Recently\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope and X-ray observations have revealed large\npopulations of obscured quasars that have been inferred from models of the\nX-ray background and supermassive black hole evolution. To date, little is\nknown about obscured quasar clustering, which allows us to measure the masses\nof their host dark matter halos and explore their role in the cosmic evolution\nof black holes and galaxies. In this study we use a sample of 806 mid-infrared\nselected quasars and ~250,000 galaxies to calculate the projected quasar-galaxy\ncross-correlation function w_p(R). The observed clustering yields\ncharacteristic dark matter halo masses of log (M_halo [h^-1 M_sun]) =\n12.7^+0.4_-0.6 and 13.3^+0.3_-0.4 for unobscured quasars (QSO-1s) and obscured\nquasars (Obs-QSOs), respectively. The results for QSO-1s are in excellent\nagreement with previous measurements for optically-selected quasars, while we\nconclude that the Obs-QSOs are at least as strongly clustered as the QSO-1s. We\ntest for the effects of photometric redshift errors on the optically-faint\nObs-QSOs, and find that our method yields a robust lower limit on the\nclustering; photo-z errors may cause us to underestimate the clustering\namplitude of the Obs-QSOs by at most ~20%. We compare our results to previous\nstudies, and speculate on physical implications of stronger clustering for\nobscured quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The problem of\nunderestimating tail losses becomes even more severe, when calibration issues\nare taken into account. To demonstrate this we choose a Merton-type structural\nmodel as our reference system. Diffusion and jump-diffusion are considered as\nunderlying processes. We run Monte Carlo simulations of this model and\ncalibrate different recovery models to the simulation data. For simplicity, we\ntake the default probabilities directly from the simulation data.

As the standard deviations are unknown, an\nadaptive design is often recommended. The asymptotic justification of this\napproach is arguable, since it uses the normal approximation in tails where the\nerror in the approximation is larger than the estimated quantity. We consider\ntwo different approaches for optimality of designs that are related to Pitman\nand Bahadur definitions of relative efficiency of tests.

The\nadsorbate dopants on the upper side of the graphene establish a displacement\nfield perpendicular to the graphene surface breaking the inversion symmetry of\nthe two graphene layers.

This\nwould imply that the companion candidate is young, which would strengthen the\ncase for a physical companion, and moreover that the object would be in the\nsubstellar regime, according to the Ks upper limit. Another exciting\npossibility would be that this companion is a recently formed planet within the\ndisk. Additional observations are mandatory to confirm that the object is bound\nand to properly characterize it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 13:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

It reveals new, previously unknown, properties that all generalized\nspaces with a lower Ricci curvature bound must have and it has a number of\napplications.\n  This new kind of estimate asserts that the geometry of small balls along any\nminimizing geodesic changes in a H\\\"older continuous way with a constant\ndepending on the lower bound for the Ricci curvature, the dimension of the\nmanifold, and the distance to the end points of the geodesic. We give examples\nthat show that the H\\\"older exponent, along with essentially all the other\nconsequences that we show follow from this estimate, are sharp. The unified\ntheme for all of these applications is convexity.\n  Among the applications is that the regular set is convex for any\nnon-collapsed limit of Einstein metrics. In the general case of potentially\ncollapsed limits of manifolds with just a lower Ricci curvature bound we show\nthat the regular set is weakly convex and $a.e.$ convex, that is almost every\npair of points can be connected by a minimizing geodesic whose interior is\ncontained in the regular set. We also show two conjectures of Cheeger-Colding.\nOne of these asserts that the isometry group of any, even collapsed, limit of\nmanifolds with a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound is a Lie group; the key\npoint for this is to rule out small subgroups. The other asserts that the\ndimension of any limit space is the same everywhere. Finally, we show that a\nReifenberg type property holds for collapsed limits and discuss why this\nindicate further regularity of manifolds and spaces with Ricci curvature\nbounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 14:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 10:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-23"}

Here we undertake a critical study of the\nevidence for such extreme values of beta, combining three new WFC3/IR-selected\nsamples of galaxies spanning ~2 decades in UV luminosity over the redshift\nrange z~4.5-8. We explore the impact of inclusion/exclusion of less robust\nhigh-z candidates, and use the varying depths of the samples to explore the\neffects of noise and selection bias. Simple data-consistency arguments suggest\nthat artificially blue average values of beta can result when the analysis is\nextended into the deepest ~ 0.5-mag bin of these WFC3/IR-selected samples,\nregardless of the actual luminosity or z range probed. By confining attention\nto robust, well-detected high-z galaxy candidates, we find that the average\nvalue of beta is consistent with -2.05 +/- 0.10 for z=5-7, and -22 < M_UV <\n-18. We create and analyse a set of simulations which demonstrate that a bias\ntowards artifically low/blue average values of beta is indeed expected when the\nUV slope analysis is extended towards the source detection threshold, and\nconclude that there is as yet no clear evidence for UV slopes significantly\nbluer than beta ~ -2, the typical value displayed by the bluest star-forming\ngalaxies at more modest z. A robust measurement of beta for the faintest\ngalaxies at z~7-8 remains a key observational goal, as it provides a\nfundamental test for high escape fractions from a potentially abundant source\nof reionizing photons.

Noting the mixture model description of the MMNL, we employ a Bayesian\nnonparametric approach, using nonparametric priors on the unknown mixing\ndistribution $G$, to estimate choice probabilities. We provide an important\ntheoretical support for the use of the proposed methodology by investigating\nconsistency of the posterior distribution for a general nonparametric prior on\nthe mixing distribution. Consistency is defined according to an $L_1$-type\ndistance on the space of choice probabilities and is achieved by extending to a\nregression model framework a recent approach to strong consistency based on the\nsummability of square roots of prior probabilities. Moving to estimation,\nslightly different techniques for non-panel and panel data models are\ndiscussed. For practical implementation, we describe efficient and relatively\neasy-to-use blocked Gibbs sampling procedures.

Causality\nanalysis is commonly applied to study connectivity, so this work focuses on\ndemonstrating that also the detection of activations can be handled with a\ncausality analysis. We test our method on finger tapping data, in which GLM and\nGranger Causality approaches are compared in finding activations. Granger\ncausality not only performs the task well, but indeed we obtained a better\nlocalization (i.e. precision) of activations. As a result we claim that\ncausality must be the main tool to investigate activations, since it is a\nmeasure of \"how much\" the stimulus influences the BOLD signal, and since it\nunifies connectivity and activations analysis under the same area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 15:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-25"}

Using lattice gauge theory the properties of\nthe technigluons in this scenario are investigated as a function of the\ntechniquark mass towards the massless limit. For that purpose the minimal\nLandau gauge two-point and three-point correlation functions are determined,\nincluding a detailed systematic error analysis.
