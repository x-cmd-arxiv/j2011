We compute the partition function of 5D minimal\nsupersymmetric U(1) gauge theory with extra adjoint matter in general\nOmega-background. These N=2^* theories are massive deformations of N=4 SYM and\ncan be thought of as a minimal supersymmetric five dimensional theory\ncompactified on a circle. Such partition functions encode very rich topological\ninformation. We show that this partition function at some special values of the\nparameters directly reproduces the generating function for the Poincare`\npolynomial of the moduli space of instantons. We discuss the basic aspects of\nworldsheet and penta-brane instantons as well as (unoriented) D-brane\ninstantons and threshold corrections to BPS-saturated couplings in superstring\ntheories. We consider non-perturbative superpotentials generated by `gauge' and\n`exotic' instantons living on D3-branes at orientifold singularities. We also\ndiscuss the interplay between worldsheet and D-string instantons on T^4/Z_2. We\nfocus on a 4-fermi amplitude and offer a multi D-string instanton\ninterpretation.

First we consider the realm of\nphenomenological laboratory data and astrophysical observations, and the hints\nthey can give on the characteristics that the nuclear medium should possess.\nThe analysis is based on phenomenological models, that however have a strong\nbasis on physical intuition and an impressive success. More microscopic models\nare also considered, and it is shown that they are able to give invaluable\ninformation on the nuclear medium, in particular on its Equation of State. The\ninterplay between laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations are\nparticularly stressed, and it is shown how their complementarity enriches\nenormously our insights into the structure of the nuclear medium. We then\nintroduce the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the microscopic many-body theory\nof nuclear matter, with a critical discussion about the different approaches\nand their results. The Landau Fermi Liquid theory is introduced and briefly\ndiscussed. As illustrative example, we discuss neutron matter at very low\ndensity, and it is shown how it can be treated within the many-body theory. A\nsection is dedicated to the pairing problem. The connection with nuclear\nstructure is then discussed, on the basis of the Energy Density Functional\nmethod. The possibility to link the physics of exotic nuclei and the\nastrophysics of neutron stars is particularly stressed. Finally we discuss the\nthermal properties of the nuclear medium, in particular the liquid-gas phase\ntransition and its connection with the phenomenology on heavy ion reactions and\nthe cooling evolution of neutron stars. The presentation has been taken for\nnon-specialists and possibly for non-nuclear physicists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 17:14:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2012 16:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The source shows the shortest recurrence time ever\nobserved from a neutron star. Here we present a study of the morphological,\nspectral and temporal properties of 107 of the bursts observed by the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer. The recurrence time and the fluence of the bursts\nclearly anticorrelate with the increase of the persistent X-ray flux. The ratio\nbetween the energy generated by the accretion of mass and that liberated during\nbursts indicate that Helium is ignited in a Hydrogen rich layer. Therefore we\nconclude that all the bursts shown by IGR J17480-2446 are Type-I X-Ray bursts.\nPulsations could be detected in all the brightest bursts and no drifts of the\nfrequency are observed within 0.25 Hz of the spin frequency of the neutron\nstar. These are also phase locked with respect to the pulsations observed\nduring the persistent emission and no rise of the rms associated to the pulse\nfrequency is observed during the burst. This behavior would favor a scenario\nwhere the flash is ignited within a region which is consistent to be as large\nas the neutron star surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 17:28:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 07:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This setup allows light entering the resonator setup\nfrom a tapered fiber to evolve along a variety of different pathways before\nleaving again through the fiber. In particular, the loop configuration of the\nresonators allows for an evolution which we term roundtrip process, in which\nthe light evolves from one resonator sequentially through all others back to\nthe initial one. This process renders the optical properties of the system\nsensitive to the phases of all coupling and scattering constants in the system.\nWe analyze the transmission and reflection spectra, and interpret them in terms\nof interference between the various possible evolution pathways through the\nresonator system. In particular, we focus on the phase dependence of the\noptical properties. Finally, we discuss possible applications for this phase\nsensitivity induced by the roundtrip process, such as the measurement of the\nposition of a nanoparticle close to one of the resonators, and the measurement\nof changes in the refractive index between two resonators. Our analytical\nresults for the applications are supported by proof-of-principle calculations\nbased on finite-difference-time-domain solution ofMaxwell's equations in two\ndimensions on a grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 17:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This work conveys experimental evidence of the dominant\nrole of modal dispersion in counters built at the 1 meter scale, a fact that\nresults in large cross-talk levels and strong signal shaping.

It was also shown that if the\norder of the quotient group is even, such singular varieties have projective\ncrepant resolutions, which are therefore smooth Calabi-Yau manifolds. The\nresulting topological transitions were called hyperconifold transitions, and\nchange the fundamental group as well as the Hodge numbers.

This dynamical configuration likely resulted from\nresonance capture as Neptune migrated outward during the late stages of planet\nformation. The details of Neptune's planetesimal-driven migration, including\nits radial extent and the concurrent eccentricity evolution of the planet, are\nthe subject of considerable debate. Two qualitatively different proposals for\nresonance capture have been proposed--migration-induced capture driven by\nsmooth outward evolution of Neptune's orbit and chaotic capture driven by\ndamping of the planet's eccentricity near its current semi-major axis. We\ndemonstrate that the distribution of comparable-mass, wide-separation binaries\noccupying resonant orbits can differentiate between these two scenarios. If\nmigration-induced capture occurred, this fraction records information about the\nformation locations of different populations of KBOs. Chaotic capture, in\ncontrast, randomizes the orbits of bodies as they are placed in resonance. In\nparticular, migration-induced capture produces the following signatures. The\n2:1 resonance should contain a dynamically cold component, with inclinations\nless than 5-10 degrees, having a binary fraction comparable to that among cold\nclassical KBOs. If the 3:2 resonance also hosts a cold component, its binary\nfraction should be 20-30% lower than in the cold classical belt.

The diversity of the quasi-static flat-fading MIMO\nchannel consisting of any arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas is\nfully characterized, showing that full spatial diversity is possible if and\nonly if the rate is within a certain bound which is a function of the number of\nantennas.

In particular, we point out the\nimportant role of the phase derivatives, that appear due to the\nneutrino-neutrino interaction, and show how it can cause an oscillating\ndegeneracy between the diagonal elements of the matter basis Hamiltonian. Our\nresults also reveal, that the end of the synchronization regime is due to a\nrapid increase of the phase derivative, and identify the condition to be\nfulfilled for the onset of bipolar oscillations involving both the off-diagonal\nneutrino-neutrino interaction contributions and the vacuum terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 23:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2011 09:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Motivated by instances of the\nhitting set problem where the number of sets to be hit is large, we introduce\nthe notion of implicit hitting set problems. In an implicit hitting set problem\nthe collection of sets to be hit is typically too large to list explicitly;\ninstead, an oracle is provided which, given a set H, either determines that H\nis a hitting set or returns a set that H does not hit. We show a number of\nexamples of classic implicit hitting set problems, and give a generic algorithm\nfor solving such problems optimally. The main contribution of this paper is to\nshow that this framework is valuable in developing approximation algorithms. We\nillustrate this methodology by presenting a simple on-line algorithm for the\nminimum feedback vertex set problem on random graphs. In particular our\nalgorithm gives a feedback vertex set of size n-(1/p)\\log{np}(1-o(1)) with\nprobability at least 3/4 for the random graph G_{n,p} (the smallest feedback\nvertex set is of size n-(2/p)\\log{np}(1+o(1))). We also consider a planted\nmodel for the feedback vertex set in directed random graphs. Here we show that\na hitting set for a polynomial-sized subset of cycles is a hitting set for the\nplanted random graph and this allows us to exactly recover the planted feedback\nvertex set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 23:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-09"}

A powerful generalization of this problem is to find fixed points\nof averaged resolvents (i.e., firmly nonexpansive mappings).\n  This paper concerns the relationship between the set of fixed points of\naveraged resolvents and certain fixed point sets of compositions of resolvents.\nIt partially extends recent work for two mappings on a question of C.

A complete convergence proof\nthat is based on averaged mappings is provided for the first algorithm.

In the first part,\nthe linear-programming (LP) decoder for binary linear codes is extended to JD\nof binary-input FSCs. In particular, we provide a rigorous definition of LP\njoint-decoding pseudo-codewords (JD-PCWs) that enables evaluation of the\npairwise error probability between codewords and JD-PCWs in AWGN. This leads\nnaturally to a provable upper bound on decoder failure probability. If the\nchannel is a finite-state intersymbol interference channel, then the joint LP\ndecoder also has the maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property and all\ninteger-valued solutions are codewords. In this case, the performance loss\nrelative to ML decoding can be explained completely by fractional-valued\nJD-PCWs. After deriving these results, we discovered some elements were\nequivalent to earlier work by Flanagan on LP receivers.\n  In the second part, we develop an efficient iterative solver for the joint LP\ndecoder discussed in the first part. In particular, we extend the approach of\niterative approximate LP decoding, proposed by Vontobel and Koetter and\nanalyzed by Burshtein, to this problem. By taking advantage of the dual-domain\nstructure of the JD-LP, we obtain a convergent iterative algorithm for joint LP\ndecoding whose structure is similar to BCJR-based turbo equalization (TE). The\nresult is a joint iterative decoder whose per-iteration complexity is similar\nto that of TE but whose performance is similar to that of joint LP decoding.\nThe main advantage of this decoder is that it appears to provide the\npredictability of joint LP decoding and superior performance with the\ncomputational complexity of TE. One expected application is coding for magnetic\nstorage where the required block-error rate is extremely low and system\nperformance is difficult to verify by simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 00:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 19:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Previous studies are\nconcentrated on a static rumor spreading. The content of the rumor is\ninvariable during the whole spreading process.

In an early psychological experiment, researchers\nfound about 70% of details in a rumor were lost in the first 6 mouth-to-mouth\ntransmissions \\cite{TPR}. Based on the facts, we investigate rumor spreading on\nsocial networks, where the content of the rumor is modified by the individuals\nwith a certain probability. In the scenario, they have two choices, to forward\nor to modify. As a forwarder, an individual disseminates the rumor directly to\nits neighbors. As a modifier, conversely, an individual revises the rumor\nbefore spreading it out. When the rumor spreads on the social networks, for\ninstance, scale-free networks and small-world networks, the majority of\nindividuals actually are infected by the multi-revised version of the rumor, if\nthe modifiers dominate the networks. Our observation indicates that the\noriginal rumor may lose its influence in the spreading process. Similarly, a\ntrue information may turn to be a rumor as well.

A continuing challenge,\nhowever, is guiding an autoencoder toward representations that are useful for\nparticular tasks. A complementary challenge is to find codes that are invariant\nto irrelevant transformations of the data. The most common way of introducing\nsuch problem-specific guidance in autoencoders has been through the\nincorporation of a parametric component that ties the latent representation to\nthe label information. In this work, we argue that a preferable approach relies\ninstead on a nonparametric guidance mechanism. Conceptually, it ensures that\nthere exists a function that can predict the label information, without\nexplicitly instantiating that function. The superiority of this guidance\nmechanism is confirmed on two datasets.

The angular momentum distribution of massive\nstellar endpoints provides a rare means of constraining the nature of the\ncentral engine in core-collapse explosions. Unlike supermassive black holes,\nthe spin of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems is little affected\nby accretion, and accurately reflects the spin set at birth. A modest number of\nstellar-mass black hole angular momenta have now been measured using two\nindependent X-ray spectroscopic techniques. In contrast, rotation-powered\npulsars spin-down over time, via magnetic braking, but a modest number of natal\nspin periods have now been estimated. For both canonical and extreme neutron\nstar parameters, statistical tests strongly suggest that the angular momentum\ndistributions of black holes and neutron stars are markedly different. Within\nthe context of prevalent models for core-collapse supernovae, the angular\nmomentum distributions are consistent with black holes typically being produced\nin GRB-like supernovae with jets, and with neutron stars typically being\nproduced in supernovae with too little angular momentum to produce jets via\nmagnetohydrodynamic processes. It is possible that neutron stars are imbued\nwith high spin initially, and rapidly spun-down shortly after the supernova\nevent, but the available mechanisms may be inconsistent with some observed\npulsar properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 04:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Most solutions for\nproviding incentives in P2P networks are based on direct reciprocity, which are\nnot appropriate for most P2P multimedia sharing networks due to the unique\nfeatures exhibited by such networks: large populations of anonymous agents\ninteracting infrequently, asymmetric interests of peers, network errors, and\nmultiple concurrent transactions. In this paper, we design and rigorously\nanalyze a new family of incentive protocols that utilizes indirect reciprocity\nwhich is based on the design of efficient social norms. In the proposed P2P\nprotocols, the social norms consist of a social strategy, which represents the\nrule prescribing to the peers when they should or should not provide content to\nother peers, and a reputation scheme, which rewards or punishes peers depending\non whether they comply or not with the social strategy. We first define the\nconcept of a sustainable social norm, under which no peer has an incentive to\ndeviate. We then formulate the problem of designing optimal social norms, which\nselects the social norm that maximizes the network performance among all\nsustainable social norms. Hence, we prove that it becomes in the self-interest\nof peers to contribute their content to the network rather than to free-ride.\nWe also investigate the impact of various punishment schemes on the social\nwelfare as well as how should the optimal social norms be designed if\naltruistic and malicious peers are active in the network.

Within this framework the evolution of the probability\ndensity function (PDF) of the magnitude of particle velocities as a function of\nthe number of collisions $n$ is determined by the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE).\nIn the literature the FPE is constructed by identifying the transport\ncoefficients with the ensemble averages of the change of the magnitude of\nparticle velocity and its square in the course of one collision. Although this\ntreatment leads to the correct solution after a sufficiently large number of\ncollisions has been reached, the transient part of the evolution of the PDF is\nnot described. Moreover, in the case of the Fermi-Ulam model (FUM), if a\nstadanrd simplification is employed, the solution of the FPE is even\ninconsistent with the values of the transport coefficients used for its\nderivation. The goal of our work is to provide a self-consistent methodology\nfor the treatment of Fermi acceleration in time-dependent billiards. The\nproposed approach obviates any assumptions for the continuity of the random\nprocess and the existence of the limits formally defining the transport\ncoefficients of the FPE. Specifically, we suggest, instead of the calculation\nof ensemble averages, the derivation of the one-step transition probability\nfunction and the use of the Chapman-Kolmogorov forward equation. This approach\nis generic and can be applied to any time-dependent billiard for the treatment\nof Fermi-acceleration. As a first step, we apply this methodology to the FUM,\nbeing the archetype of time-dependent billiards to exhibit Fermi acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 09:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2012 08:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We recently suggested that WASP-12b may host a bow shock\naround its magnetosphere, similarly to the one observed around the Earth. For\nWASP12b, the shock is detected in the near-UV transit light curve.\nObservational follow-up suggests that the near-UV light curve presents temporal\nvariations, which may indicate that the stand-off distance between the shock\nand the planet is varying. This implies that the size of the planet's\nmagnetosphere is adjusting itself in response to variations in the surrounding\nambient medium. We investigate possible causes of shock variations for the\nknown eccentric (e>0.3) transiting planets.

Putting initially all atoms in mF = 1 component we\nobserve a significant transfer of atoms to other, initially empty Zeeman states\nexclusively due to dipolar forces. Because of conservation of a total angular\nmomentum the atoms going to other Zeeman components acquire an orbital angular\nmomentum and circulate around the center of the trap. This is a realization of\nEinstein-de Haas effect in a system of cold gases. We show that the transfer of\natoms via dipolar interaction is possible only when the energies of the initial\nand the final sates are equal. This condition can be fulfilled utilizing a\nresonant external magnetic field, which tunes energies of involved states via\nthe linear Zeeman effect. We found that there are many final states of\ndifferent spatial density which can be tuned selectively to the initial state.\nWe show a simple model explaining high selectivity and controllability of weak\ndipolar interactions in the condensate of Rb-87 atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 10:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-04"}

Our knowledge of their observational properties has\nconsiderably improved over the past decade, and the long standing questions\nconcerning their origin and rarity are now starting to receive some answers. It\nis nowadays fairly well established that massive cluster mergers are the key\ningredient to account for the origin of halos and relics. The increasing number\nof halos and relics found now allow to derive significant statistical\ncorrelations. It has been shown that galaxy clusters may be radio-loud or\nradio--quiet with respect to the presence of radio halos. Morevoer, radio halos\nand relics are present only in unrelaxed clusters, whereas no such sources have\never been found in relaxed systems. It has also become clear that a large\ndistribution exists for the spectral index of the synchrotron spectrum of radio\nhalos, and ultra-steep halos have been found.\n  Despite all this, a number of observational issues remain open. Well defined\nradio spectra, from ~ hundred MHz to GHz frequencies and good spectral imaging\nare available only for few halos and relics, and such information is crucial\nfor a detailed understanding of their origin. It is presently unclear if there\nare basic differences between clusters with ultra steep spectrum radio halos\nand those hosting \"classical\" ones, and it is unknown if less energetic mergers\nresult in an observational signature in the radio band. With the forthcoming\nadvent of LOFAR and of the SKA Pathfinders, we will soon be able to observe\ngalaxy clusters with a major improvement in the radio sensitivity and frequency\ncoverage, and we expect to be able to soon address some of these pressing\nquestions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 11:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Observational samples of SNIa commonly use the\nmetallicity of the host galaxy, Z_host, as an estimator of the supernova\nprogenitor metallicity, Z_Ia, that is one of the primary factors affecting SNIa\nmagnitude. Here, we present a theoretical study of the relationship between\nZ_Ia and Z_host. We follow the chemical evolution of homogeneous galaxy models\ntogether with the evolution of the supernova rates in order to evaluate the\nmetallicity distribution function, MDF(Delta Z), i.e. the probability that the\nlogarithm of the metallicity of a SNIa exploding now differs in less than Delta\nZ from that of its host. We analyse several model galaxies aimed to represent\nfrom active to passive galaxies, including dwarf galaxies prone to experience\nsupernova driven outflows. We analyse the sensitivity of the MDF to uncertain\ningredients: IMF, star-formation law, stellar lifetime, stellar yields, and\nSNIa delay-time distribution. There is a remarkable degree of agreement between\nthe mean Z_Ia in a galaxy and its Z_host when they both are measured as the CNO\nabundance, especially if the DTD peaks at small time delays, while the average\nFe abundance of host and SNIa may differ up to 0.4-0.6 dex in passive galaxies.\nThe dispersion of Z_Ia in active galaxy models is quite small, meaning that\nZ_host is a quite good estimator of the supernova metallicity. Passive galaxies\npresent a larger dispersion, which is more pronounced in low mass galaxies. We\ndiscuss the use of different metallicity indicators: Fe vs. O, and gas-phase\nmetallicity vs. stellar metallicity.

In addition, in the $d$-CDW state\nthe Fermi surface is reconstructed toward pockets with low spectral weight in\nthe outer part, resembling the arcs observed in angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy experiments. However, the $d$-CDW requires broken translational\nsymmetry, a fact that is not completely accepted.

We aim to increase the number of optical identifications\nand study the properties of the host galaxies of young radio sources. We\ncross-correlated the CSS B3-VLA sample with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS), DR7, and complemented the SDSS photometry with available GALEX (DR 4/5\nand 6) and near-IR data from UKIRT and 2MASS. We obtained new identifications\nand photometric redshifts for eight faint galaxies and for one quasar and two\nquasar candidates. Overall we have 27 galaxies with SDSS photometry in five\nbands, for which we derived the ultraviolet-optical spectral energy\ndistribution (UV-O-SED). We extended our investigation to additional CSS/GPS\nselected from the literature. Most of the galaxies show an excess of\nultra-violet (UV) radiation compared with the UV-O-SED of local radio-quiet\nellipticals. We found a strong dependence of the UV excess on redshift and\nanalyzed it assuming that it is generated either from the nucleus (hidden\nquasar) or from a young stellar population (YSP). We also compare the UV-O-SEDs\nof our CSS/GPS sources with those of a selection of large size (LSO) powerful\nradio sources from the literature. If the major process of the UV excess is\ncaused by a YSP, our conclusion is that it is the result of the merger process\nthat also triggered the onset of the radio source with some time delay.

This\nillustrates the occurrence of the characteristic shift and the significance of\nthe effective response function of the detector.\n  We introduce the concept of a tilted polarizing interface and provide a\nscheme for its experimental implementation.

Here, we discuss the extreme physical properties\npossible for the first characterized rocky super-Earth, CoRoT-7b (R_pl = 1.58\n\\pm 0.10 R_Earth, Mpl = 6.9 \\pm 1.2 M_Earth). It is extremely close to its star\n(a = 0.0171 AU = 4.48 R_st), with its spin and orbital rotation likely\nsynchronized. The comparison of its location in the (Mpl, Rpl) plane with the\npredictions of planetary models for different compositions points to an\nEarth-like composition, even if the error bars of the measured quantities and\nthe partial degeneracy of the models prevent a definitive conclusion. The\nproximity to its star provides an additional constraint on the model. It\nimplies a high extreme-UV flux and particle wind, and the corresponding\nefficient erosion of the planetary atmosphere especially for volatile species\nincluding water. Consequently, we make the working hypothesis that the planet\nis rocky with no volatiles in its atmosphere, and derive the physical\nproperties that result. As a consequence, the atmosphere is made of rocky\nvapours with a very low pressure (P \\leq 1.5 Pa), no cloud can be sustained,\nand no thermalisation of the planetary is expected. The dayside is very hot\n(2474 \\leq 71 K at the sub-stellar point) while the nightside is very cold (50\nto 75 K). The sub-stellar point is as hot as the tungsten filament of an\nincandescent bulb, resulting in the melting and distillation of silicate rocks\nand the formation of a lava ocean. These possible features of CoRoT-7b could be\ncommon to many small and hot planets, including the recently discovered\nKepler-10b. They define a new class of objects that we propose to name\n\"Lava-ocean planets\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 15:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
