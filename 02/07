The SN event was detected late and a detailed\ninvestigation of its light curves and spectra spanning 200 days suggest that it\nis an event of type IIP similar to archetypal SNe 2004et and 1999em. However,\nin contrast to other events of its class, the SN 2008gz exhibits rarely\nobserved V magnitude drop of 1.5 over the period of a month during plateau to\nnebular phase. Using 0.21 mag of Av as a lower limit and a distance of 25.5\nMpc, we estimate synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.05 \\pm 0.01 M* and a\nmid-plateau Mv of -16.6 \\pm 0.2 mag. The photospheric velocity is observed to\nbe higher than that was observed for SN 2004et at similar epochs, indicating\nexplosion energy was comparable to or higher than SN 2004et.

By comparing its\nproperties with other well studied events as well as by using a recent\nsimulation of pre-SN models of Dessart, Livne & Waldman (2010), we infer an\nexplosion energy range of 2 - 3 x 10$^{51}$ erg and this coupled with the\nobserved width of the forbidden [O I] 6300-6364 {\\AA} line at 275 days after\nthe explosion gives an upper limit for the main-sequence (non-rotating, solar\nmetallicity) progenitor mass of 17 M*.

These differences lead to lack of\ncorrespondence between simulations of the IMF behaviour at 1 AU and\nobservations. Our results indicate that picture of the IMF expansion into space\nis more complicated than usually considered, and the sector structure is not\nthe only source of the two-humped shape of the in-ecliptic or radial IMF\ncomponent. We have analysed data from different spacecraft at the distances\nfrom 0.29 AU to 4 AU and found that the shape of the radial IMF component\ndistribution strongly depends on a heliocentric distance and a heliolatitude.\nThe \"two-humped IMF\" effect is most brightly expressed at low heliolatitudes at\n0.7-2 AU, but it fully disappears at 3-4 AU. There is also dependence of the\nIMF distributions' view on a solar cycle due to active processes, such as solar\nflares and CMEs. We suppose that the in-ecliptic solar wind field at 1 AU is\ninfluenced by solar active regions in a high degree, and actually the\ndistribution is the three-humped: two humps correspond to the IMF from the\nmiddle and high heliolatitudes and the third one is the theoretically expected\ndistribution from the solar field nearby the heliomagnetic equator.

This Presentation Review is an\ninnovative scientific product to meet the request of information about the\nphenomenology of the DM mystery at galactic scale. This Review concerns the\nmass discrepancy phenomenon detected in galaxies, usually accounted by\npostulating the presence of a non luminous non baryonic component. In the\ntheoretical framework of Newtonian Gravity we recall the properties of Dark\nMatter halos as emerging from the state-of-the-art of numerical simulations\nperformed in the current $\\Lambda CDM$ scenario. Then, the simple but\nmuch-telling phenomenology of the distribution of dark and luminous matter in\nSpirals, Ellipticals, and dwarf Spheroidals is reported. We show that a\ncoherent observational framework emerges from reliable data of different large\nsamples of objects and it is obtained by different methods of investigation. We\nthen highlight the impressive evidence that the distribution of dark and\nluminous matter are closely correlated and that have universal features. Hints\non the cosmological role of this phenomenological scenario are then given.\nFinally, we discuss the constraints on the elusive nature of the dark particle\nthat the actual distribution of DM around galaxies pose on its direct and\nindirect searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2011 19:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-08"}

In this paper we re-prove the result by using solely\nthe Wasserstein gradient-flow structure of the system. In particular we make no\nuse of the linearity, nor of the fact that it is a second-order system. The\nfirst key step in this approach is a reformulation of the equation as the\nminimization of an action functional that captures the property of being a\ncurve of maximal slope in an integrated form. The second important step is a\nrescaling of space. Using only the Wasserstein gradient-flow structure, we\nprove that the sequence of rescaled solutions is pre-compact in an appropriate\ntopology. We then prove a Gamma-convergence result for the functional in this\ntopology, and we identify the limiting functional and the differential equation\nthat it represents. A consequence of these results is that solutions of the\n{\\epsilon}-problem converge to a solution of the limiting problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2011 21:04:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2011 03:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

We focus on threshold-based correlation screening methods for\nthree related applications: screening for variables with large correlations\nwithin a single treatment (autocorrelation screening); screening for variables\nwith large cross-correlations over two treatments (cross-correlation\nscreening); screening for variables that have persistently large\nauto-correlations over two treatments (persistent-correlation screening). The\nnovelty of correlation screening is that it identifies a smaller number of\nvariables which are highly correlated with others, as compared to identifying a\nnumber of correlation parameters. Correlation screening suffers from a phase\ntransition phenomenon: as the correlation threshold decreases the number of\ndiscoveries increases abruptly. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the mean\nnumber of discoveries and the phase transition thresholds as a function of the\nnumber of samples, the number of variables, and the joint sample distribution.\nWe also show that under a weak dependency condition the number of discoveries\nis dominated by a Poisson random variable giving an asymptotic expression for\nthe false positive rate. The correlation screening approach bears tremendous\ndividends in terms of the type and strength of the asymptotic results that can\nbe obtained. It also overcomes some of the major hurdles faced by existing\nmethods in the literature as correlation screening is naturally scalable to\nhigh dimension. Numerical results strongly validate the theory that is\npresented in this paper. We illustrate the application of the correlation\nscreening methodology on a large scale gene-expression dataset, revealing a few\ninfluential variables that exhibit a significant amount of correlation over\nmultiple treatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2011 21:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2011 23:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Unlike traditional Wi-Fi networks, with each access point\n(AP) connected to the wired network, in WMNs only a subset of the APs are\nrequired to be connected to the wired network. The APs that are connected to\nthe wired network are called the Internet gateways (IGWs), while the APs that\ndo not have wired connections are called the mesh routers (MRs). The MRs are\nconnected to the IGWs using multi-hop communication. The IGWs provide access to\nconventional clients and interconnect ad hoc, sensor, cellular, and other\nnetworks to the Internet. However, most of the existing routing protocols for\nWMNs are extensions of protocols originally designed for mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs) and thus they perform sub-optimally. Moreover, most routing protocols\nfor WMNs are designed without security issues in mind, where the nodes are all\nassumed to be honest. In practical deployment scenarios, this assumption does\nnot hold. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of security issues in\nWMNs and then particularly focuses on secure routing in these networks. First,\nit identifies security vulnerabilities in the medium access control (MAC) and\nthe network layers. Various possibilities of compromising data confidentiality,\ndata integrity, replay attacks and offline cryptanalysis are also discussed.\nThen various types of attacks in the MAC and the network layers are discussed.\nAfter enumerating the various types of attacks on the MAC and the network\nlayer, the chapter briefly discusses on some of the preventive mechanisms for\nthese attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 03:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-08"}

We define DS as a large layout of stochastically repetitive spatial\nconfigurations of dynamic objects (swarm elements) whose motions exhibit local\nspatiotemporal interdependency and stationarity, i.e., the motions are similar\nin any small spatiotemporal neighborhood. Examples of DS abound in nature,\ne.g., herds of animals and flocks of birds. To capture the local spatiotemporal\nproperties of the DS, we present a probabilistic model that learns both the\nspatial layout of swarm elements and their joint dynamics that are modeled as\nlinear transformations. To this end, a spatiotemporal neighborhood is\nassociated with each swarm element, in which local stationarity is enforced\nboth spatially and temporally. We assume that the prior on the swarm dynamics\nis distributed according to an MRF in both space and time. Embedding this model\nin a MAP framework, we iterate between learning the spatial layout of the swarm\nand its dynamics. We learn the swarm transformations using ICM, which iterates\nbetween estimating these transformations and updating their distribution in the\nspatiotemporal neighborhoods. We demonstrate the validity of our method by\nconducting experiments on real video sequences. Real sequences of birds, geese,\nrobot swarms, and pedestrians evaluate the applicability of our model to real\nworld data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 12:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-08"}

At\nlow magnetization, the large size of the shock precursor indeed provides enough\ntime for electromagnetic micro-instabilities to grow and such\nmicro-instabilities generate small scale turbulence that in turn provides the\nscattering required. The present paper extends our previous analysis on the\ndevelopment of these micro-instabilities to account for the finite angular\ndispersion of the beam of reflected and accelerated particles and to account\nfor the expected heating of the upstream electrons in the shock precursor. We\nshow that the oblique two stream instability may operate down to values of the\nshock Lorentz factor gamma_{sh}~10 as long as the electrons of the upstream\nplasma remain cold, while the filamentation instability is strongly inhibited\nin this limit; however, as electrons get heated to relativistic temperatures,\nthe situation becomes opposite and the two stream instability becomes inhibited\nwhile the filamentation mode becomes efficient, even at moderate values of the\nshock Lorentz factor. The peak wavelength of these instabilities migrates from\nthe inertial electron scale towards the proton inertial scale as the background\nelectrons get progressively heated during the crossing of the shock precursor.\nWe also discuss the role of current driven instabilities upstream of the shock.\nIn particular, we show that the returning/accelerated particles give rise to a\ntransverse current through their rotation in the background magnetic field. We\nfind that the compensating current in the background plasma can lead to a\nBuneman instability which provides an efficient source of electron heating.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 14:06:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 08:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

U and Th abundances of more than 50\nsamples representative of the main lithotypes belonging to the Mesozoic and\nCenozoic sedimentary cover were analyzed. Sedimentary rocks were grouped into\nfour main \"Reservoirs\" based on similar paleogeographic conditions and\nmineralogy. Basement rocks do not outcrop in the area. Thus U and Th in the\nUpper and Lower Crust of Valsugana and Ivrea-Verbano areas were analyzed. Based\non geological and geophysical properties, relative abundances of the various\nreservoirs were calculated and used to obtain the weighted U and Th abundances\nfor each of the three geological layers (Sedimentary Cover, Upper and Lower\nCrust). Using the available seismic profile as well as the stratigraphic\nrecords from a number of exploration wells, a 3D modelling was developed over\nan area of 2^{\\circ}x2^{\\circ} down to the Moho depth, for a total volume of\nabout 1.2x10^6 km^3. This model allowed us to determine the volume of the\nvarious geological layers and eventually integrate the Th and U contents of the\nwhole crust beneath LNGS. On this base the local contribution to the\ngeo-neutrino flux (S) was calculated and added to the contribution given by the\nrest of the world, yielding a Refined Reference Model prediction for the\ngeo-neutrino signal in the Borexino detector at LNGS: S(U) = (28.7 \\pm 3.9) TNU\nand S(Th) = (7.5 \\pm 1.0) TNU. An excess over the total flux of about 4 TNU was\npreviously obtained by Mantovani et al. (2004) who calculated, based on general\nworldwide assumptions, a signal of 40.5 TNU.

Our proposal is to make the core\nbounded by turning some of the inequalities defining the core into equalities\n(additional efficiency constraints). We address the following mathematical\nproblem: can we find a minimal set of inequalities in the core such that, if\nturned into equalities, the core becomes bounded? The new core obtained is\ncalled the restricted core. We completely solve the question when $\\cF$ is a\ndistributive lattice, introducing also the notion of restricted Weber set. We\nshow that the case of regular set systems amounts more or less to the case of\ndistributive lattices. We also study the case of weakly union-closed systems\nand give some results for the general case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 15:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-08"}

Therefore, the 1-additive core\ncoincides with the classical core. The advantages of the $k$-additive core is\nthat it is never empty once $k\\geq 2$, and that it preserves the idea of\ncoalitional rationality. However, it produces $k$-imputations, that is,\nimputations on individuals and coalitions of at most $k$ inidividuals, instead\nof a classical imputation. Therefore one needs to derive a classical imputation\nfrom a $k$-order imputation by a so-called sharing rule. The paper investigates\nwhat set of imputations the $k$-additive core can produce from a given sharing\nrule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 15:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-08"}
