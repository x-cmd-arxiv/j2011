Using temporal modulations of the confining force, we probe the\nmechanical properties of the configuration and we define and measure its\neffective compressibility.

In the optical range of spectrum we will consider two cases: first, the\nsource has not eigenfrequency, and second, the source has eigenfrequency. In\nthe first case, when the Cherenkov radiation occurs, the non-zero\neigenfrequency produces a paradox for Doppler effect. It is shown that the\nabsence of the eigenfrequency solves the paradox known in the literature. The\nquestion whether the process is normal (i.e. hard photons are being radiated\nunder the small angles) or anomalous depends on the law of the medium\ndispersion. When the source has an eigenfrequency the Doppler effects can be\neither normal or anomalous. In the X-ray range of the oscillator radiation\nspectrum we have two photons radiated under the same angle- soft and hard. In\nthis case the radiation obeys to so-called complicated Doppler effect, i.e. in\nthe soft photon region we have anomalous Doppler effect and in the hard photon\nregion we have normal Doppler effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2011 16:08:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2011 22:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 15:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2011 13:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

The\ntechnique uses sequences of magnetograms directly as lower boundary conditions\nto drive the evolution of coronal magnetic fields between successive force-free\nequilibria over long periods of time. It is illustrated by applying it to MDI\nobservations of a decaying active region, NOAA AR 8005. The active region is\nmodeled during a 4 day period around its central meridian passage. Over this\ntime, the dispersal of the active region is dominated by random motions due to\nsmall scale convective cells. Through studying the build up of magnetic energy\nin the model, it is found that such small scale motions may inject anywhere\nfrom $2.5-3 \\times 10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ of free magnetic energy into the\ncoronal field. Most of this energy is stored within the center of the active\nregion in the low corona, below 30 Mm. After 4 days the build-up of free energy\nis 10% that of the corresponding potential field. This energy buildup, is\nsufficient to explain the radiative losses at coronal temperatures within the\nactive region.

Our global luminosity function (down to\nM_r<= -16) does not show the presence of an upturn at faint magnitudes, while\nwe do observe a strong dependence of its shape on both richness and\ncluster-centric radius, with a brightening of M^* and an increase of the dwarf\nto giant ratio with richness, indicating that more massive systems are more\nefficient in creating/retaining a population of dwarf satellites.

The evolutionary history of each element is different\nowing to the effects of the initial progenitor mass and metallicity on element\nproduction. In the bulge and thick disk the star formation timescale is shorter\nthan in the solar neighbourhood, leading to higher [alpha/Fe] ratios. Likewise,\nthe smaller contribution from Type Ia supernovae in these regions leads to\nlower [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K,\nSc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity on element\nproduction from core-collapse supernovae.

These calculations were motivated by the recent detection of Se\nemission lines in a large number of planetary nebulae. Se is a potentially\nuseful tracer of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis, but accurate determinations\nof its abundance in photoionized nebulae have been hindered by the lack of\natomic data governing its ionization balance. Our calculations were carried out\nin intermediate coupling with semi-relativistic radial wavefunctions.

For DR, we allowed dn=0 core excitations, which are\nimportant at photoionized plasma temperatures. DR is the dominant recombination\nprocess for each of these Se ions at temperatures representative of\nphotoionized nebulae (~10^4 K).

The response of each detector in\nturn is also investigated. Results: We find that on 2004 November 6 the\nobserved oscillations correspond to the nutation period of the RHESSI\ninstrument.

This issue is particularly problematic for detector 5 due to\nits design characteristics. Dynamic correction of the RHESSI counts, accounting\nfor the livetime, data gaps, and the transmission of the bi-grid collimator of\neach detector, is required to overcome this issue.

The bit energy consumption and goodput expressions\nhave been derived as functions of transmission rate in a given AF or DF TWRN.\nNumerical results are used to identify the optimal transmission rates where the\nbit energy consumption is minimized or the goodput is maximized. The network\nperformances are compared in terms of energy and transmission efficiency in AF\nand DF modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2011 04:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-01"}

We\ninvestigated possible azimuthal variations in shock strength and shape, finding\nindications for a weak shock with a Mach number in the range ~1.2-1.3. We\nmeasured the temperature change across the shock front. However, the detection\nof a temperature rise in the regions immediately inside of the front is\ncomplicated by the underlying temperature profile of the cluster atmosphere. We\nmeasured the global temperature profile of the cluster up to 700 kpc, which\nrepresents the farthest measurement obtained with Chandra for this cluster. A\n\"plateau\" in the temperature profile in the range ~70-150 kpc indicates the\npresence of cool gas, which is likely the result of uplift of material by the\nAGN outburst. After masking the cool filaments visible in the hardness ratio\nmap, the plateau disappears and the temperature profile recovers a typical\nshape with a peak around 190 kpc, just inside the shock front. However, it is\nunlikely that such a temperature feature is produced by the shock as it is\nconsistent with the general shape of the temperature profiles observed for\nrelaxed galaxy clusters. We studied the spectral properties of the cool\nfilaments finding evidence that ~10^11 M_sun of low-entropy material has been\ndredged up by the rising lobes from the central 30 kpc to the observed current\nposition of 75-150 kpc. The energy required to lift the cool gas is >~2.2 x\n10^60 erg, which is comparable to the work required to inflate the cavities and\nis ~25% of the total energy of the large-scale shock. Our results show that the\nAGN feedback in Hydra A is acting not only by directly heating the gas, but\nalso by removing a substantial amount of potential fuel for the SMBH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2011 09:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

One of the critical\nchallenges for operating such radios in a network is how to efficiently\nallocate transmission powers and frequency resource among the secondary users\n(SUs) while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints of the primary\nusers (PUs). In this paper, we focus on the non-cooperative power allocation\nproblem in cognitive wireless mesh networks (CogMesh) formed by a number of\nclusters with the consideration of energy efficiency. Due to the SUs' selfish\nand spontaneous properties, the problem is modeled as a stochastic learning\nprocess.

An intelligent SU performs Q-function updates based on the\nconjecture over the other SUs' stochastic behaviors.

A strong extractor takes two inputs, a weakly-random x and a\nuniformly random seed y, and outputs a string which appears uniform, even given\ny. For a non-malleable extractor nmExt, the output nmExt(x,y) should appear\nuniform given y as well as nmExt(x,A(y)), where A is an arbitrary function with\nA(y) not equal to y.\n  We show that an extractor introduced by Chor and Goldreich is non-malleable\nwhen the entropy rate is above half. It outputs a linear number of bits when\nthe entropy rate is 1/2 + alpha, for any alpha>0. Previously, no nontrivial\nparameters were known for any non-malleable extractor. To achieve a polynomial\nrunning time when outputting many bits, we rely on a widely-believed conjecture\nabout the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. Our\nanalysis involves a character sum estimate, which may be of independent\ninterest.\n  Using our non-malleable extractor, we obtain protocols for \"privacy\namplification\": key agreement between two parties who share a weakly-random\nsecret. Our protocols work in the presence of an active adversary with\nunlimited computational power, and have asymptotically optimal entropy loss.\nWhen the secret has entropy rate greater than 1/2, the protocol follows from a\nresult of Dodis and Wichs, and takes two rounds. When the secret has entropy\nrate delta for any constant delta>0, our new protocol takes a constant\n(polynomial in 1/delta) number of rounds.
