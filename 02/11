Most of the current works\ndealing with spectrum management in the CRN focus on a single task of the\nproblem, e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing or\nspectrum mobility. In this work, we argue that for certain network\nconfigurations, jointly performing several tasks of the spectrum management\nimproves the spectrum efficiency. Specifically, we study the uplink resource\nmanagement problem in a CRN where there exist multiple cognitive users (CUs)\nand access points (APs), with each AP operates on a set of non-overlapping\nchannels. The CUs, in order to maximize their uplink transmission rates, have\nto associate to a suitable AP (spectrum decision), and to share the channels\nbelong to this AP with other CUs (spectrum sharing). These tasks are clearly\ninterdependent, and the problem of how they should be carried out efficiently\nand distributedly is still open in the literature.\n  In this work we formulate this joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing\nproblem into a non-cooperative game, in which the feasible strategy of a player\ncontains a discrete variable and a continuous vector. The structure of the game\nis hence very different from most non-cooperative spectrum management game\nproposed in the literature. We provide characterization of the Nash Equilibrium\n(NE) of this game, and present a set of novel algorithms that allow the CUs to\ndistributively and efficiently select the suitable AP and share the channels\nwith other CUs.

The viscosity is ascribed to those stable distorted\nstructures which do not jump back, but relax by the relaxation of the\nsurrounding viscoelastic matrix. It is shown that this mechanism implies a\ndescription in terms of the shear compliance, with a viscosity which can be\ncalculated from the cutoff of the retardation spectrum.

Mapping of 392 spots vs.\nlongitude indicates the presence of a region free of spots, close to the\nequator, reminiscent of the coronal holes observed on the Sun during periods of\nmaximum activity. With this interpretation, the stellar rotation period within\nthe transit latitudes of -14.\\circ 6 \\pm 10 \\circ is found to be 4.48 days.\nThis rotation period is shorter than the 4.54 days as derived from the\nout-of-transit light modulation. Since the transit data samples a region close\nto the stellar equator, while the period determined from out-of-transit data\nreflects the average rotation of the star, this is taken as an indication of a\nlatitudinal differential rotation of about 3% or 0.042 rad/d.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 18:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The 6 cm observations detect diffuse linearly-polarized emission\nthroughout the region with a brightness of roughly 1 mJy per 15\"x10\" beam. The\nFaraday rotation measure (RM) toward this polarized emission has structure on\ndegree size scales and ranges from roughly +330 rad/m2 east of the dynamical\ncenter (Sgr A) to -880 rad/m2 west of the dynamical center. This RM structure\nis also seen toward several nonthermal radio filaments, which implies that they\nhave a similar magnetic field orientation and constrains models for their\norigin. Modeling shows that the RM and its change with Galactic longitude are\nbest explained by the high electron density and strong magnetic field of the GC\nregion.

Our\nmigration simulations begin with Jupiter and Saturn on orbits already well\nseparated from their mutual 2:1 mean-motion resonance. Neptune and Uranus are\ndecoupled from each other and have orbital eccentricities damped to near their\ncurrent values. From this point we adopt a planet migration model in which the\nmigration speed decreases exponentially with a characteristic timescale tau\n(the e-folding time). We perform a series of numerical simulations, each\ninvolving the migrating giant planets plus test particle Trojans and\nquasi-satellites. We find that the libration frequencies of Trojans are similar\nto those of quasi-satellites. This similarity enables a dynamical exchange of\nobjects back and forth between the Trojan and quasi-satellite resonances during\nplanetary migration. Furthermore, under the influence of these secondary\nresonances quasi-satellites can have their libration amplitudes enlarged until\nthey undergo a close-encounter with their host planet and escape from the\nresonance. High-resolution simulations of this escape process reveal that ~80%\nof Jovian quasi-satellites experience one or more close-encounters within\nJupiter's Hill radius (R_H) as they are forced out of the quasi-satellite\nresonance. As many as ~20% come within R_H/4 and ~2.5% come within R_H/10.\nClose-encounters of escaping quasi-satellites occur near or even below the\n2-body escape velocity from the host planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 20:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We analytically substantiate this conjecture for a series of FQH\nstates defined as unique zero modes of pseudopotential Hamiltonians by finding\na one to one map between the thermodynamic limit counting of two different\nentanglement spectra: the particle entanglement spectrum, whose counting of\neigenvalues for each good quantum number is identical (up to accidental\ndegeneracies) to the counting of bulk quasiholes, and the orbital entanglement\nspectrum (the Li-Haldane spectrum).

By\nusing a set of clustering operators which have their origin in conformal field\ntheory (CFT) operator expansions, we show that the counting of the orbital\nentanglement spectrum eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit must be identical\nto the counting of quasiholes in the bulk.

To develop a physically unequivocal theory, we start from the\nslave-boson mean-field theory for the Hubbard model on a square lattice. Our\ncrucial step is to further take into account the charge dynamics and\nfluctuations. The extra charge fluctuations seriously modify low-energy\nsingle-particle spectra of doped Mott insulators near the Fermi level: An\nelectron added around an empty site (or a hole added around a doubly occupied\nsite) constitutes composite fermion (cofermion), called holo-electron (or\ndoublo-hole) at low energy in distinction from the normal quasiparticles. These\nunexplored composite fermions substantiate the extra charge fluctuation. We\nshow that the quasiparticles hybridize with the holo-electrons and\ndoublo-holes. The resultant hybridization gap is identified as the pseudogap\nobserved in the underdoped region of the high-T_c cuprates. Because the Fermi\nlevel crosses the top (bottom) of the low-energy band formed just below (above)\nthe hybridization gap in the hole-doped (electron-doped) case, it causes a\nFermi-surface reconstruction, namely, a topological change in the Fermi surface\nforced by the penetration of zeros of the quasiparticle Green function. This\nreconstruction signals the emergence of a non-Fermi-liquid phase. The\npseudogap, and the resultant formation of pocket or arc of the Fermi surface\nreproduce the experimental results for the cuprate superconductors in the\nunderdoped region.

Using the X-ray luminosity function\nand the local mass function of supermassive black holes, SMBHs we can reproduce\nthe individual radio luminosity functions of radio sources showing high- and\nlow-excitation narrow emission lines. The data favour spin distributions that\nare bimodal, with one component around spin zero and the other close to maximal\nspin. In the low-excitation galaxies, the two components have similar\namplitudes. For the high-excitation galaxies, the amplitude of the high-spin\npeak is typically much smaller than that of the low-spin peak. A bimodality\nshould be seen in the radio loudness of quasars.

Here we\npresent GMRT and WSRT observations of a new double relic in the galaxy cluster\nZwCl 0008.8+5215. Optical V, R, and I band images of the cluster were taken\nwith the INT. An optical spectrum, to determine the redshift of the cluster,\nwas taken with the WHT. Our observations show the presence of a double radio\nrelic in the galaxy cluster ZwCl 0008.8+5215, for which we find a spectroscopic\nredshift of z = 0.1032 \\pm 0.0018 from an optical spectrum of one of the cD\ngalaxies.

A ROSAT X-ray image displays an elongated ICM and the large-scale\ndistribution of galaxies reveals two cluster cores, all pointing towards a\nbinary cluster merger event. The radio relics are located symmetrically with\nrespect to the X-ray center of the cluster, along the proposed merger axis. The\nrelics have a linear extent of 1.4 Mpc and 290 kpc.

We apply the method to 48 world\nindices, one for each of 48 different countries. We find long-range power-law\ncross-correlations in the absolute values of returns that quantify risk, and\nfind that they decay much more slowly than cross-correlations between the\nreturns. The magnitude of the cross-correlations constitute \"bad news\" for\ninternational investment managers who may believe that risk is reduced by\ndiversifying across countries. We find that when a market shock is transmitted\naround the world, the risk decays very slowly. We explain these time lag\ncross-correlations by introducing a global factor model (GFM) in which all\nindex returns fluctuate in response to a single global factor. For each pair of\nindividual time series of returns, the cross-correlations between returns (or\nmagnitudes) can be modeled with the auto-correlations of the global factor\nreturns (or magnitudes). We estimate the global factor using principal\ncomponent analysis, which minimizes the variance of the residuals after\nremoving the global trend. Using random matrix theory, a significant fraction\nof the world index cross-correlations can be explained by the global factor,\nwhich supports the utility of the GFM. We demonstrate applications of the GFM\nin forecasting risks at the world level, and in finding uncorrelated individual\nindices. We find 10 indices are practically uncorrelated with the global factor\nand with the remainder of the world indices, which is relevant information for\nworld managers in reducing their portfolio risk. Finally, we argue that this\ngeneral method can be applied to a wide range of phenomena in which time series\nare measured, ranging from seismology and physiology to atmospheric geophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 21:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Conventional centroid estimation fits a template point\nspread function (PSF) to the image data. Because the PSF is typically not known\nto high accuracy due to wavefront aberrations and uncertainties in optical\nsystem, a simple Gaussian function is commonly used. PSF knowledge error leads\nto systematic errors in the conventional centroid estimation. In this paper, we\npresent an accurate centroid estimation algorithm by reconstructing the PSF\nfrom well sampled (above Nyquist frequency) pixelated images. In the limit of\nan ideal focal plane array whose pixels have identical response function (no\ninter-pixel variation), this method can estimate centroid displacement between\ntwo 32$\\times$32 images to sub-micropixel accuracy. Inter-pixel response\nvariations exist in real detectors, {\\it e.g.}~CCDs, which we can calibrate by\nmeasuring the pixel response of each pixel in Fourier space. The Fourier\ntransforms of the inter-pixel variations of pixel response functions can be\nconveniently expressed in terms of powers of spatial wave numbers using their\nTaylor series expansions. Calibrating up to the third order terms in this\nexpansion, we show that our centroid displacement estimation is accurate to a\nfew micro-pixels using simulated data. This algorithm is applicable to the new\nproposed mission concept Nearest Earth Astrometry Telescope (NEAT) to achieve\nmirco-arcsecond accuracy in relative astrometry for detecting terrestrial\nexoplanets.

Specifically, the LIA states that the\nvelocity field induced by a curved vortex filament is asymmetric in the\nbinormal direction. Up to a potential term, the induced incompressible field is\ngiven by the Biot-Savart integral, where we recall that there is a direct\nanalogy between hydrodynamics and magnetostatics.

The workshop took place in\nSaarbruecken, Germany, on April 2nd, 2011, as part of the fourteenth edition of\nthe European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2011).\nResearch in term and graph rewriting ranges from theoretical questions to\npractical issues. Computing with graphs handles the sharing of common\nsubexpressions in a natural and seamless way, and improves the efficiency of\ncomputations in space and time. Sharing is ubiquitous in several research\nareas, for instance : the modelling of first- and higher-order term rewriting\nby (acyclic or cyclic) graph rewriting, the modelling of biological or chemical\nabstract machines, the implementation techniques of programming languages. Term\ngraphs are also used in automated theorem proving and symbolic computation\nsystems working on shared structures. The aim of this workshop is to bring\ntogether researchers working in different domains on term and graph\ntransformation and to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for\npresenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn\nabout current activities in term graph rewriting. These proceedings contain six\naccepted papers and the abstracts of three invited talks. All submissions were\nsubject to careful refereeing. The topics of accepted papers range over a wide\nspectrum, including theoretical aspects of term graph rewriting, proof methods,\nsemantics as well as application issues of term graph transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2011 02:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-14"}

We also point out that there is a PTAS for games with\nsparse payoff matrices, which are known to be PPAD-complete to solve exactly.\nBoth algorithms are of a special kind that we call oblivious: The algorithm\njust samples a fixed distribution on pairs of mixed strategies, and the game is\nonly used to determine whether the sampled strategies comprise an eps-Nash\nequilibrium; the answer is yes with inverse polynomial probability.

Fifteen new\nLi-rich giants including four super Li-rich K giants (A(Li) >= 3.2) were\ndiscovered. A significant finding is that there is a concentration of Li-rich K\ngiants at the luminosity of the clump or red horizontal branch. This new\nfinding is partly a consequence of the fact that our low-resolution survey is\nthe first large survey to include giants well below and above the RGB bump and\nclump locations in the HR diagram. Origin of the lithium enrichment may be\nplausibly attributed to the conversion of 3He via 7Be to 7Li by the\nCameron-Fowler mechanism but the location for onset of the conversion is\nuncertain. Two possible opportunities to effect this conversion are discussed:\nthe bump in the first ascent of the red giant branch (RGB) and the He-core\nflash at the tip of the RGB. The finite luminosity spread of the Li-rich giants\nserves to reject the idea that Li enhancement is, in general, a consequence of\na giant swallowing a large planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2011 08:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In H-alpha observations of filaments,\nsome threads can be observed for only 5 - 20 minutes before they seem to fade\nand eventually disappear, suggesting that these threads may have very short\nlifetimes. The presence of an instability might be the cause of this quick\ndisappearance. Here, we study the thermal instability of prominence threads as\nan explanation of their sudden disappearance from H-alpha observations. We\nmodel a prominence thread as a magnetic tube with prominence conditions\nembedded in a coronal environment. We assume a variation of the physical\nproperties in the transverse direction, so that the temperature and density\ncontinuously change from internal to external values in an inhomogeneous\ntransitional layer representing the particular prominence-corona transition\nregion (PCTR) of the thread. We use the nonadiabatic and resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations, which include terms due to thermal conduction\nparallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, radiative losses, heating,\nand magnetic diffusion. We combine both analytical and numerical methods to\nstudy linear perturbations from the equilibrium state, focusing on unstable\nthermal solutions. We find that thermal modes are unstable in the PCTR for\ntemperatures higher than 80,000 K, approximately. These modes are related to\ntemperature disturbances that can lead to changes in the equilibrium due to\nrapid plasma heating or cooling. For typical prominence parameters, the\ninstability time scale is of the order of a few minutes and is independent of\nthe form of the temperature profile within the PCTR of the thread. This result\nindicates that thermal instability may play an important role for the short\nlifetimes of threads in the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2011 10:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The methodology\nwe use here is based on the automated variability classification pipeline which\nwas previously developed for and applied successfully to the CoRoT exofield\ndatabase and to the limited subset of a few thousand Kepler asteroseismology\nlight curves. We use a Fourier decomposition of the light curves to describe\ntheir variability behaviour and use the resulting parameters to perform a\nsupervised classification. Several improvements have been made, including a\nseparate extractor method to detect the presence of eclipses when other\nvariability is present in the light curves. We also included two new\nvariability classes compared to previous work: variables showing signs of\nrotational modulation and of activity. Statistics are given on the number of\nvariables and the number of good candidates per class. A comparison is made\nwith results obtained for the CoRoT exoplanet data. We present some special\ndiscoveries, including variable stars in eclipsing binary systems. Many new\ncandidate non-radial pulsators are found, mainly Delta Sct and Gamma Dor stars.\nWe have studied those samples in more detail by using 2MASS colours. The full\nclassification results are made available as an online catalogue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2011 10:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Thus, when qubits are measured,\nthere is a high probability of finding the target entity. However, the number\nof times quantum rotation transform is to be applied for reaching near the\nvicinity of the target is a function of the number of target entities present\nin the unsorted database, which is generally unknown. A wrong estimate of the\nnumber of target entities can lead to overshooting or undershooting the\ntargets, thus reducing the success probability. Some proposals have been made\nto overcome this limitation. These proposals either employ quantum counting to\nestimate the number of solutions or fixed point schemes. This paper proposes a\nnew scheme for stopping the application of quantum rotation transformation on\nreaching near the targets by measurement and subsequent processing to estimate\nthe distance of the state vector from the target states. It ensures a success\nprobability, which is at least greater than half for all the ratios of the\nnumber of target entities to the total number of entities in a database, which\nare less than half.

After the first observation from the rising phase reported\nin 2008, its observability at high redshift is attracting enormous attention.\nWe perform multigroup radiation hydrodynamics calculations of explosions for\nevolutionary presupernova models with various main-sequence masses $M_{\\rm\nMS}$, metallicities $Z$, and explosion energies $E$. We present multicolor\nlight curves of shock breakout in Type II plateau SNe, being the most frequent\ncore-collapse SNe, and predict apparent multicolor light curves of shock\nbreakout at various redshifts $z$. We derive the observable SN rate and\nreachable redshift as functions of filter $x$ and limiting magnitude $m_{x,{\\rm\nlim}}$ by taking into account an initial mass function, cosmic star formation\nhistory, intergalactic absorption, and host galaxy extinction. We propose a\nrealistic survey strategy optimized for shock breakout. For example, the\n$g'$-band observable SN rate for $m_{g',{\\rm lim}}=27.5$ mag is 3.3 SNe\ndegree$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$ and a half of them locates at $z\\geq1.2$. It is clear\nthat the shock breakout is a beneficial clue to probe high-$z$ core-collapse\nSNe. We also establish ways to identify shock breakout and constrain SN\nproperties from the observations of shock breakout, brightness, time scale, and\ncolor.
