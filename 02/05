Isotopic\nmeasurements by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) verified a presolar\ncircumstellar origin for the grains. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nexamination of the crystal structure and chemistry of the grains was enabled by\nin situ sectioning and lift-out with a focused-ion-beam scanning-electron\nmicroscope. Comparisons of isotopic compositions with models indicate that four\nof the five grains formed in low-mass stars that evolved through the\nred-giant/asymptotic-giant branches, whereas one grain formed in the ejecta of\na Type II supernova. Selected-area electron-diffraction patterns show that all\ngrains are single crystals of hibonite. Some grains contain stacking faults and\nsmall spreads in orientation that can be attributed to a combination of growth\ndefects and mechanical processing by grain-grain collisions. The similar\nstructure of the supernova grain to those from RGB/AGB stars indicates a\nsimilarity in the formation conditions. Radiation damage, if present, occurs\nbelow our detection limit. Of the five grains we studied, only one has the pure\nhibonite composition of CaAl12O19. All others contain minor amounts of Mg, Si,\nTi, and Fe. The microstructural data are generally consistent with theoretical\npredictions, which constrain the circumstellar condensation temperature to a\nrange of 1480 K to 1743 K, assuming a corresponding total gas pressure between\n1 x 10-3 and 1 x 10-6 atm. The TEM data were used to develop a calibration for\nSIMS determination of Ti contents in oxide grains. Grains with extreme 18O\ndepletions, indicating deep mixing has occurred in their parent AGB stars, are\nslightly Ti-enriched compared to grains from stars without deep mixing, most\nlikely reflecting differences in grain condensation conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 16:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Identical apertures are used for all\nquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. We show that galaxies with purely old\nstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated FUV-V and\nFUV-NUV colours with the integrated Mgb and Hbeta absorption linestrength\nindices, strongest for FUV-NUV. Correlations with the NUV-V colour, Fe5015\nindex and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. These correlations put\nstringent constraints on the origin of the UV-upturn phenomenon in early-type\ngalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. In particular,\ndespite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between FUV-V colour\nand Mg linestrength originally publicised by Burstein et al. (1988), which we\nrefer to as the \"Burstein relation\", suggesting a positive dependence of the\nUV-upturn on metallicity. We argue that the scatter in the correlations is\nreal, and present mild evidence that a strong UV excess is preferentially\npresent in slow-rotating galaxies. We also demonstrate that most outliers in\nthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some at\nvery low levels. We believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,\nafforded by the deep and varied data available for the SAURON sample, explains\nwhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallower\nsurveys. This is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sample\nof more distant early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),\nmore easily comparable with current and future large surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 16:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Cluster formation is governed by processes\nacting on galactic scales, and star cluster disruption is driven by the tidal\nfield. In this paper, we present a self-consistent model for the formation and\nevolution of star cluster populations, for which we combine an N-body/SPH\ngalaxy evolution code with semi-analytic models for star cluster evolution. The\nmodel includes star formation, feedback, stellar evolution, and star cluster\ndisruption by two-body relaxation and tidal shocks. We apply the model by\nsimulating a suite of 9 isolated disc galaxies and 24 galaxy mergers. The\nevolutionary histories of individual clusters in these simulations are\ndiscussed to illustrate how the environment of clusters changes in time and\nspace. The resulting variability of the disruption rate with time and space\naffects the properties of star cluster populations. The combined effect of\nclusters escaping their dense formation sites (`cluster migration') and the\npreferential disruption of clusters residing in dense environments (`natural\nselection') implies that the mean disruption rate of the population decreases\nwith cluster age. This affects the slope of the cluster age distribution, which\nbecomes a function of the star formation rate density. The evolutionary\nhistories of clusters in a galaxy merger vary widely and determine which\nclusters survive the merger. This impacts the age distributions and the\nlocations of the surviving clusters at all times during a merger. We conclude\nthat accounting for the interplay between the formation, disruption, and\norbital histories of clusters enables a more sophisticated interpretation of\nobserved properties of cluster populations, thereby extending the role of\ncluster populations as tracers of galaxy evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Compact binary mergers are prime sources of\nGW, targeted by current and next generation detectors. Numerical simulations\nhave demonstrated that these mergers eject energetic sub-relativistic (or even\nrelativistic) outflows. This is certainly the case if the mergers produce short\nGRBs, but even if not, significant outflows are expected. The interaction of\nsuch outflows with the surround matter inevitably leads to a long lasting radio\nsignal. We calculate the expected signal from these outflows (our calculations\nare also applicable to short GRB orphan afterglows) and we discuss their\ndetectability. We show that the optimal search for such signal should,\nconveniently, take place around 1.4 GHz. Realistic estimates of the outflow\nparameters yield signals of a few hundred $\\mu$Jy, lasting a few weeks, from\nsources at the detection horizon of advanced GW detectors. Followup radio\nobservations, triggered by GW detection, could reveal the radio remnant even\nunder unfavorable conditions.

The canonical explanation calls for the progenitor binary system to\nundergo two subsequent mass-transfer events, both of which are unstable and\nlead to a common envelope (CE). However, it has been shown that if both CE\nevents obey the standard alpha-prescription (parametrizing energy loss), it is\nnot possible to reproduce all of the observed systems. The gamma-prescription\nwas proposed as an alternative to this description, instead parametrizing the\nfraction of angular momentum carried away in dynamical-timescale mass loss. In\nthis paper, we analyze simultaneous energy and angular-momentum conservation,\nand show that the gamma-prescription cannot adequately describe a CE event for\nan arbitrary binary, nor can the first phase of mass loss always be understood\nin general as a dynamical-timescale event. We consider in detail the first\nepisode of mass transfer in binary systems with initially low companion masses,\nwith a primary mass in the range 1.0--1.3 solar masses and an initial mass\nratio between the secondary and primary stars of 0.83--0.92. In these systems,\nthe first episode of dramatic mass loss may be stable, non-conservative mass\ntransfer. This strips the donor's envelope and dramatically raises the mass\nratio; the considered progenitor binary systems can then evolve into DWDs after\npassing through a single CE during the second episode of mass loss. We find\nthat such a mechanism reproduces the properties of the observed DWD systems\nwhich have an older component with less than approximately 0.46 solar masses\nand mass ratios between the younger and older WDs greater than 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 00:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Gap-induced dot states\ncan coexist and couple with states introduced by an electrostatic potential.\nThis property allows the region in which the resulting states are localized to\nbe tuned with the potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 01:12:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 23:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

To this\nend, we performed numerical simulations of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for a H$_2^+$ model ion interacting with two time-delayed laser\npulses. The scenario considered corresponds to a pump-probe scheme, in which\nthe first (pump) pulse excites the molecular ion to the first excited\ndissociative state and the second (probe) pulse ionizes the electron as the ion\ndissociates. The results of our numerical simulations for the ionization yield\nas a function of the time delay between the two pulses exhibit characteristic\noscillations due to interferences between the partial electron waves emerging\nfrom the two protons in the dissociating hydrogen molecular ion. We show that\nthe photon energy of the pump pulse should be in resonance with the $\\sigma_g -\n\\sigma_u$ transition and the pump pulse duration should not exceed 5 fs in\norder to generate a well confined nuclear wavepacket. The spreading of the\nnuclear wavepacket during the dissociation is found to cause a decrease of the\namplitudes of the oscillations as the time delay increases. We develop an\nanalytical model to fit the oscillations and show how dynamic information about\nthe nuclear wavepacket, namely velocity, mean internuclear distance and\nspreading, can be retrieved from the oscillations. The predictions of the\nanalytical model are tested well against the results of our numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 01:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

As\none of the possible BSM physics which might be discovered early at the LHC,\nextra neutral gauge bosons $Z^\\prime$s are theoretical well motivated. Once\n$Z^\\prime$s are discovered at the LHC, it is crucial to discriminate different\n$Z^\\prime$s in various BSM. In principle such task can be accomplished by\nmeasuring the angular distribution of the final states which are produced via\n$Z^\\prime$-mediated processes. In the real data analysis, asymmetry is always\nadopted. In literature several asymmetries have been proposed at the LHC. Based\non these works, we stepped further on to study how to optimize the asymmetries\nin the left-right model and the sequential standard model, as the examples of\nBSM. In this paper, we examined four kinds of asymmetries, namely\nrapidity-dependent forward-backward asymmetry, one-side forward-backward\nasymmetry, central charge asymmetry and edge charge asymmetry (see text for\ndetails), with $\\ell^+\\ell^-$ ($\\ell=e,\\mu$), $b\\bar b$ and $t\\bar t$ as the\nfinal states. In the calculations with $b\\bar b$ and $t\\bar t$ final states,\nthe QCD-induced higher order contributions to the asymmetric cross section were\nalso included. For each kind of final states, we estimated the four kinds of\nasymmetries and especially the optimal cut usually associated with the\ndefinition of the asymmetry. Our numerical results indicated that the capacity\nto discriminate $Z^\\prime$ models can be improved by imposing the optimal cuts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 02:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Recent developments in loop quantum cosmology avoid the\nsingularity and the big bang is replaced by a big bounce. A classical theory of\ngravitation in flat space-time also avoids the singularity under natural\nconditions on the density parameters. The universe contracts to a positive\nminimum and then it expands during all times. It is not symmetric with regard\nto its minimum implying a finite age measured with proper time of the universe.\nThe space of the universe is flat and the total energy is conserved. Under the\nassumption that the sum of the density parameters is a little bit bigger than\none the universe is very hot in early times. Later on, the cosmological model\nagrees with the one of general relativity. A new interpretation of a\nnon-expanding universe may be given by virtue of flat space-time theory of\ngravitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 11:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-08"}
