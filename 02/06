Except for the confirmed peak (RC peak) of {\\Delta}{\\nu} of\nred-clump (RC) stars, i.e. core-helium burning stars, there are a gap and a\nmain sequence (MS) peak in the distributions of {\\nu}_max and {\\Delta}{\\nu} of\nyoung clusters. The gap corresponds mainly to the Hertzsprung gap phase of\nevolution. The RC peak is caused by the fact that the radius of many RC stars\nnear the zero-age horizontal branch concentrates in a certain range. The MS\npeak also results from the fact that many MS stars which are located in a\ncertain mass range have an approximate radius in the early phase of MS. The MS\npeak barely exists in the simulated clusters with age < 1.0 Gyr. The location\nof the MS peak moves to a lower frequency with increasing age or metallicity,\nwhich may be applied to constrain the age and metallicity of young clusters.\nFor the simulated clusters with Z = 0.02, the frequency of the location of the\ndominant RC peak increases with age when age < 1.2 Gyr, and then decreases with\nage when age > 1.2 Gyr; but it scarcely varies when age > 2.4 Gyr. This is\nrelative to the degeneracy of the hydrogen-exhausted core at the time of helium\nignition. In addition, the RC peak is not sensitive to the metallicity,\nespecially for the clusters with age > 2.4 Gyr. Asteroseismical observation for\nclusters with age < 2.4 Gyr may aid in testing the theory of the degeneracy of\nthe hydrogen-exhausted core. Moreover, for the clusters with 1.1 M{\\odot} <\nM_hook < 1.3 M{\\odot}, there are a MS gap and a peak on the left of the MS gap\nin the distributions of{\\nu}_max and {\\Delta}{\\nu}, which may be applied to\nconstrain the central hydrogen abundance of stars in the MS gap and the peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 16:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 14:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The angular\nmomentum is transported outward by the magnetic stress of the turbulent flow\nwith a rate corresponding to a Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter alpha\\approx\n0.01-0.04. The result of the disk-magnetosphere interaction depends on the\norientation of the poloidal field in the disk relative to that of the star at\nthe disk-magnetosphere boundary. If fields have the same polarity, then the\nmagnetic flux is accumulated at the boundary and blocks the accretion which\nleads to the accumulation of matter at the boundary. Subsequently, this matter\naccretes to the star in outburst before accumulating again. Hence, the cycling,\n`bursty' accretion is observed. If the disc and stellar fields have opposite\npolarity, then the field reconnection enhances the penetration of the disk\nmatter towards the deeper field lines of the magnetosphere. However, the\nmagnetic stress at the boundary is lower due to the field reconnection. This\ndecreases the accretion rate and leads to smoother accretion at a lower rate.\nTest simulations show that in the case of higher accretion rate corresponding\nto alpha=0.05-0.1, accretion is bursty in cases of both polarities. On the\nother hand, at much lower accretion rates corresponding to alpha < 0.01,\naccretion is not bursty in any of these cases. We conclude that the episodic,\nbursty accretion is expected during periods of higher accretion rates in the\ndisc, and in some cases it may alternate between bursty and smooth accretion,\nif the disk brings the poloidal field of alternating polarity. We find that a\nrotating, magnetically-dominated corona forms above and below the disk, and\nthat it slowly expands outward, driven by the magnetic force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 18:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Functional MRI (fMRI) data, that provide an indirect measure of\ntask-related or spontaneous neuronal activity, are classically analyzed in a\nmass-univariate procedure yielding statistical parametric maps. This analysis\nframework disregards some important principles of brain organization:\npopulation coding, distributed and overlapping representations. Multivariate\npattern analysis, i.e., the prediction of behavioural variables from brain\nactivation patterns better captures this structure. To cope with the high\ndimensionality of the data, the learning method has to be regularized. However,\nthe spatial structure of the image is not taken into account in standard\nregularization methods, so that the extracted features are often hard to\ninterpret.

Specifically, the\nchannel or its distribution are not known but the latter is known to belong to\na class of distributions where each member is within a certain distance\n(uncertainty) from a nominal distribution. Relative entropy is used as a\nmeasure of distance between distributions. Compound outage probability defined\nas min (over the transmit signal distribution) -max (over the channel\ndistribution class) outage probability is introduced and investigated. This\ngeneralizes the standard outage probability to the case of partial channel\ndistribution information. Compound outage probability characterization (via\none-dimensional convex optimization), its properties and approximations are\ngiven. It is shown to have two-regime behavior: when the nominal outage\nprobability decreases (e.g. by increasing the SNR), the compound outage first\ndecreases linearly down to a certain threshold (related to relative entropy\ndistance) and then only logarithmically (i.e. very slowly), so that no\nsignificant further decrease is possible. The compound outage depends on the\nrelative entropy distance and the nominal outage only, all other details\n(nominal fading and noise distributions) being irrelevant. The transmit signal\ndistribution optimized for the nominal channel distribution is shown to be also\noptimal for the whole class of distributions. The effect of swapping the\ndistributions in relative entropy is investigated and an error floor effect is\nestablished. The compound outage probability under Lp distance constraint is\nalso investigated. The obtained results hold for a generic channel model\n(arbitrary nominal fading and noise distributions).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 21:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

A dynamical flow network is modeled as a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations derived from mass conservation laws on a directed\nacyclic graph with a single origin-destination pair and a constant inflow at\nthe origin. Routing policies regulate the way the inflow at a non-destination\nnode gets split among its outgoing links as a function of the current particle\ndensity, while the outflow of a link is modeled to depend on the current\nparticle density on that link through a flow function. The dynamical flow\nnetwork is called partially transferring if the total inflow at the destination\nnode is asymptotically bounded away from zero, and its weak resilience is\nmeasured as the minimum sum of the link-wise magnitude of all disturbances that\nmake it not partially transferring. The weak resilience of a dynamical flow\nnetwork with arbitrary routing policy is shown to be upper-bounded by the\nnetwork's min-cut capacity, independently of the initial flow conditions.\nMoreover, a class of distributed routing policies that rely exclusively on\nlocal information on the particle densities, and are locally responsive to\nthat, is shown to yield such maximal weak resilience. These results imply that\nlocality constraints on the information available to the routing policies do\nnot cause loss of weak resilience. Some fundamental properties of dynamical\nflow networks driven by locally responsive distributed policies are analyzed in\ndetail, including global convergence to a unique limit flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 23:12:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 01:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-30"}

This supports the idea that Evershed\nflow is a result of thermal convection in the inclined field lines.

However, the dark-cored bright filament survives at least for\n10-20 minutes after the disappearance of the Evershed flow.

This is confirmed by\ncomparison with the master equation approach for an equivalent quantum dot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2011 11:48:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2011 17:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Such health-care pervasive\napplications in smart home should focus on the inhabitant's goal or task in\ndiverse situations, rather than the various complex devices and services. The\ncore challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess\noccurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according\nto the user's intent. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive\ncomputing environment, it is difficult for an average user to obtain right\ninformation and service and in right place at right time. This paper proposes a\ncontext-driven task-oriented middleware (CDTOM) to meet the challenge. The most\nimportant component is its task model that provides an adequate high-level\ndescription of user-oriented tasks and their related contexts. Leveraging the\nmodel multiple entities can easily exchange, share and reuse their knowledge.\nBased on the hierarchy of task ontology, a novel task recognition approach\nusing CBR (case-based reasoning) is presented and the performance of task\nrecognition is evaluated by task number, context size and time costing.\nMoreover, a dynamic mechanism for mapping the recognized task and services is\nalso discussed. Finally, we present the design and implementation of our task\nsupporting system (TSS) to aid an inhabitant's tasks in light of his lifestyle\nand environment conditions in pervasive homecare environment, and the results\nof the prototype system show that our middleware approach achieves good\nefficiency of context management and good accuracy of user's activity\ninference, and can improve efficiently quality of user's life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2011 14:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-08"}
