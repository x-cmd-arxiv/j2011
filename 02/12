We start with\noutlining a general troublesome feature of the main quantum theory instrument,\nthe perturbation expansion method. The striking issue is that perturbation\nseries in powers of $\\alpha \\ll 1$ is not a convergent series. The formal\nreason is an essential singularity of quantum amplitude (matrix element)\n$C(\\alpha)$ at the origin $\\alpha=0$. In many physically important cases one\nneeds some alternative means of theoretical analysis. In particular, this\nrefers to perturbative QCD (pQCD) in the low-energy domain. In the second\nsection-lecture, we discuss the approach of Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT).\nWe start with a short historic preamble and then discuss how combining the\nDispersion Relation with the Renormalization Group (RG) techniques yields the\nAPT with \\myMath{\\displaystyle e^{-1/\\alpha}} nonanalyticity. Next we consider\nthe results of APT applications to low-energy QCD processes and show that in\nthis approach the fourth-loop contributions, which appear to be on the\nasymptotic border in the pQCD approach, are of the order of a few per mil. Then\nwe note that using the RG in QCD dictates the need to use the Fractional APT\n(FAPT) and describe its basic ingredients. As an example of the FAPT\napplication in QCD we consider the pion form factor $F_\\pi(Q^2)$ calculation.\nAt the end, we discuss the resummation of nonpower series in {(F)APT} with\napplication to the estimation of the Higgs-boson-decay width\n$\\Gamma_{H\\to\\bar{b}b}(m_H^2)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2011 16:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-05"}

Based on our adopted Zeeman splitting\nfactor of z = 1.0 Hz/mG, we detect a line of sight magnetic field of 18.4 +/-\n1.1 mG toward this source. Since such 44 GHz methanol masers arise from shocks\nin the outflows of star forming regions, we can relate our measurement of the\npost-shock magnetic field to field strengths indicated by species tracing\npre-shock regions, and thus characterize the large scale magnetic field.\nMoreover, since Class I masers trace regions more remote from the star forming\ncore than Class II masers, and possibly earlier phases, magnetic fields\ndetected in 6.7 GHz Class II and 36 GHz and 44 GHz Class I methanol maser lines\ntogether offer the potential of providing a more complete picture of the\nmagnetic field.

We use the strength of the [O IV], 25.9um emission\nline as tracer for the intrinsic AGN strength. After normalization by [O IV]\nthe observed X-ray flux provides information about X-ray absorption. The\ndistribution of X-ray / [O IV] flux ratios is significantly different for\nmasers and non-masers: The maser detected Seyfert-2s (Sy 1.8-2.0) populate a\ndistinct X-ray / [O IV] range which is, on average, about a factor four lower\nthan the range of Seyfert-2 non-masers and about a factor of ten lower than the\nrange of Seyfert-1s (Sy 1.0-1.5). Non-masers are almost equally distributed\nover the entire X-ray / [O IV] range. This provides evidence that high nuclear\nobscuration plays a crucial role for the probability of maser detection.\nFurthermore, after normalization with [O IV], we find a similar but weaker\ntrend for the distribution of the maser detection rate with the absorption of\nthe 7um dust continuum. This suggests that the obscuration of the 7 um\ncontinuum occurs on larger spatial scales than that of the X-rays. Hence, in\nthe AGN unified model, at moderate deviation from edge-on, the 7um dust\nabsorption may occur without proportionate X-ray absorption. The absorption of\n[O III] appears unrelated to maser detections. The failure to detect masers in\nobscured AGN is most likely due to insufficient observational sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2011 19:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The overwhelming focus in\nthe search for catalysing agents has been on compounds containing titanium, but\nthe precise mechanism of their actions remains somewhat obscure. A recent\nexperiment has now shown that fullerenes (C$_{60}$) can also act as catalyst\nfor both hydrogen uptake and release in lithium borohydride (LiBH$_4$).

If the properties of boxy\nbulges can be entirely explained by assuming they are bars, then this may imply\nthat their hosts are pure disc galaxies with no classical bulge. A handful of\nthese bulges, including that of the Milky Way, have been observed to rotate\ncylindrically, i.e. with a mean stellar velocity independent of height above\nthe disc. In order to assess whether such behaviour is ubiquitous in boxy\nbulges, and whether a pure disc interpretation is consistent with their stellar\npopulations, we have analysed the stellar kinematics and populations of the\nboxy or peanut-shaped bulges in a sample of five edge-on galaxies. We placed\nslits along the major axis of each galaxy and at three offset but parallel\npositions to build up spatial coverage. The boxy bulge of NGC3390 rotates\nperfectly cylindrically within the spatial extent and uncertainties of the\ndata.

We then study\nthe operator of right-multiplication within the group algebra of W by the\nelement whose coefficients are given by this statistic.\n  We reinterpret the operators geometrically in terms of the arrangement of\nreflecting hyperplanes for W. We show that they are self-adjoint and positive\nsemidefinite. via two explicit factorizations into a symmetrized form A^t A. In\none such factorization, A is a generalization of the projection of a simplex\nonto the linear ordering polytope.

It has\nfour identical channels that simultaneously process the CCD signals.\nDistinctive capability of analog-to-digital conversion enables us to construct\na CCD camera body that outputs only digital signals. As the result of the\nfront-end electronics test, it works properly with low input noise of =<30 uV\nat the pixel rate below 100 kHz. The power consumption is sufficiently low of\nabout 150 mW/chip. The input signal range of 720 mV covers the effective energy\nrange of the typical X-ray photon counting CCD (up to 20 keV). The integrated\nnon-linearity is 0.2% that is similar as those of the conventional CCDs in\norbit. We also performed a radiation tolerance test against the total ionizing\ndose (TID) effect and the single event effect. The irradiation test using 60Co\nand proton beam showed that the ASIC has the sufficient tolerance against TID\nup to 200 krad, which absolutely exceeds the expected amount of dose during the\nperiod of operating in a low-inclination low-earth orbit. The irradiation of Fe\nions with the fluence of 5.2x10^8 Ion/cm2 resulted in no single event latchup\n(SEL), although there were some possible single event upsets. The threshold\nagainst SEL is higher than 1.68 MeV cm^2/mg, which is sufficiently high enough\nthat the SEL event should not be one of major causes of instrument downtime in\norbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2011 02:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-15"}

On\nthe receiver side, iterative interference cancellation combined with decoding\nof the local code is performed to recover from collisions. The new scheme\ngeneralizes the previously proposed irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA)\ntechnique, based on a simple repetition of the users' bursts. An interpretation\nof the CSA interference cancellation process as an iterative erasure decoding\nprocess over a sparse bipartite graph is identified, and the corresponding\ndensity evolution equations derived. Based on these equations, asymptotically\noptimal CSA schemes are designed for several rates and their performance for a\nfinite number of users investigated through simulation and compared to IRSA\ncompetitors.
