How the brain mediates perceptions, creates thoughts,\nstores memories and initiates actions remains one of the most profound puzzles\nin biology, if not all of science. A key to a mechanistic understanding of how\nthe nervous system works is the ability to analyze the dynamics of neuronal\nnetworks in the living organism in the context of sensory stimulation and\nbehaviour. Dynamic brain properties have been fairly well characterized on the\nmicroscopic level of individual neurons and on the macroscopic level of whole\nbrain areas largely with the help of various electrophysiological techniques.\nHowever, our understanding of the mesoscopic level comprising local populations\nof hundreds to thousands of neurons (so called 'microcircuits') remains\ncomparably poor. In large parts, this has been due to the technical\ndifficulties involved in recording from large networks of neurons with\nsingle-cell spatial resolution and near- millisecond temporal resolution in the\nbrain of living animals. In recent years, two-photon microscopy has emerged as\na technique which meets many of these requirements and thus has become the\nmethod of choice for the interrogation of local neural circuits. Here, we\nreview the state-of-research in the field of two-photon imaging of neuronal\npopulations, covering the topics of microscope technology, suitable fluorescent\nindicator dyes, staining techniques, and in particular analysis techniques for\nextracting relevant information from the fluorescence data. We expect that\nfunctional analysis of neural networks using two-photon imaging will help to\ndecipher fundamental operational principles of neural microcircuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2011 17:48:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2011 21:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-28"}

The\ndifference with the model of Buhrman, Miltersen, Radhakrishnan, and Venkatesh\nis that we consider a bit-probe scheme with an auxiliary word.

For some reasonable values of parameters our space bound is better\nthan what can be achieved by any scheme without cached data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2011 19:24:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 20:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 08:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 10:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-16"}

The fundamental time irreversibility problem\nconsists in the following: how to reconcile the time-reversible microscopic\ndynamics and the irreversible macroscopic one. The recently proposed functional\nformulation of mechanics is aimed to solve this problem. The basic concept of\nthis formulation is not a material point and a trajectory, like in the\ntraditional formulation of mechanics, but a probability density function. Even\nif we deal with a single particle (not with an ensemble of particles), we\ndescribe its state as a probability density function. We justify this approach\nusing measurement theory. A particular problem in the framework of the\nirreversibility problem is the derivation of the Boltzmann kinetic equation\nfrom the equations of microscopic dynamics. We propose a procedure for\nobtaining the Boltzmann equation from the Liouville equation based on the BBGKY\nhierarchy, the recently proposed functional formulation of classical mechanics,\nand the distinguishing between two scales of space-time, i.e., macro- and\nmicroscale. The notion of a space-time structure is introduced. It takes into\naccount not only the space-time itself (i.e., a pseudo-Riemannian manifold),\nbut also a characteristic length and time. The space-time structures form a\nhierarchy in sense that the initial values for the processes on the microscopic\nspace-time structure (interactions of the particles) are assigned from the\nprocesses on the macroscopic one (kinetic phenomena).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2011 22:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-03"}

It has been\ntheorized that soft matter quasicrystals and approximants are largely\nentropically stabilized, but the thermodynamic mechanism underlying their\nformation remains elusive. Here, we use computer simulation and free energy\ncalculations to demonstrate a simple design heuristic for assembling\nquasicrystals and approximants in soft matter systems. Our study builds on\nprevious simulation studies of the self-assembly of dodecagonal quasicrystals\nand approximants in minimal systems of spherical particles with complex,\nhighly-specific interaction potentials. We demonstrate an alternative\nentropy-based approach for assembling dodecagonal quasicrystals and\napproximants based solely on particle functionalization and shape, thereby\nrecasting the interaction-potential-based assembly strategy in terms of\nsimpler-to-achieve bonded and excluded-volume interactions. Here, spherical\nbuilding blocks are functionalized with mobile surface entities to encourage\nthe formation of structures with low surface contact area, including\nnon-close-packed and polytetrahedral structures. The building blocks also\npossess shape polydispersity, where a subset of the building blocks deviate\nfrom the ideal spherical shape, discouraging the formation of close-packed\ncrystals. We show that three different model systems with both of these\nfeatures -- mobile surface entities and shape polydispersity -- consistently\nassemble quasicrystals and/or approximants. We argue that this design strategy\ncan be widely exploited to assemble quasicrystals and approximants on the nano-\nand micro- scales.

This change in the\nfluctuations could be a way of detecting catastrophic events before they\nhappen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 10:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-10"}

These\nexperiments have been performed over a wide range of conditions, with\ntemperatures and trap depths spanning over three decades. Different groups have\ncome up with different explanations, among them the emergence of Stoner\nferromagnetism. Here, we show that this maximum is a consequence of two major\nsteps. The first is the establishment of a population of shallow dimers, which\nis the combined effect of dimer formation through three-body recombination, and\nthe dissociation of shallow dimers back to atoms through collisions. The\ndissociation process will be temperature dependent, and is affected by Pauli\nblocking at low temperatures. The second is the relaxation of shallow dimers\ninto tightly bound dimers through atom-dimer and dimer-dimer collisions.\n  We have constructed a simple set of rate equations describing these\nprocesses. Remarkably, even with only a few parameters, these equations\nreproduce the loss rate observed in all recent experiments, despite their\nwidely different experimental conditions. Our studies show that the location of\nthe maximum loss rate depends crucially on experimental parameters such as trap\ndepth and temperature.

Super-resolution\nis the process of combining multiple aliased low-quality images to produce a\nhigh resolution, high-quality image. The problem of recovering a high\nresolution image progressively from a sequence of low resolution compressed\nimages is considered. In this paper we propose a novel DCT based progressive\nimage display algorithm by stressing on the encoding and decoding process. At\nthe encoder we consider a set of low resolution images which are corrupted by\nadditive white Gaussian noise and motion blur. The low resolution images are\ncompressed using 8 by 8 blocks DCT and noise is filtered using our proposed\nnovel zonal filter. Multiframe fusion is performed in order to obtain a single\nnoise free image.

The corresponding, complex fitness\nlandscape generates rich evolutionary dynamics as a function of parameters such\nas the population size, search space size, mutation rate, and method of\nrecombination. Furthermore, these systems are simple enough that in some cases\nthe associated model genome space can be completely characterised, shedding\nlight on how the evolutionary dynamics depends on the detailed structure of the\nfitness landscape. Finally, we apply the model to study the emergence of the\npreference for dihedral over cyclic symmetry observed for homomeric protein\ntetramers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 15:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-03"}
