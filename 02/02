In this review, the structural characterization by dynamic light\nscattering, cryo-TEM, and small angle neutron scattering is presented. Small\nangle neutron scattering results have been analyzed using numerical simulations\n- Monte Carlo or reverse Monte Carlo (RMC). Such simulations are useful to show\nthe compatibility between different models of colloidal superstructures, and\nexperiment. Our results have allowed us to propose a generic structure of\ncomplex colloids, made of a dense core of interacting colloids, bridged by\npolyelectrolyte blocks, and a hydrated corona.

Charm and beauty quarks are a\npowerful tool to investigate this high density and strongly interacting state\nof matter as they are produced in initial hard scatterings, and due to their\nlong life time, they probe all the stages of the system evolution. The detector\ndesign was optimized for heavy ions but is also well suited for pp studies.\nALICE recorded pp data at s= 7 TeV since march 2010 and the first run with\nheavy ion collisions took place in November 2010. The measurement of charm\nproduction cross section in pp collisions provides interesting insight into QCD\nprocesses and is important as a reference for heavy ion studies. The\nmeasurement of the D- meson yield in pp collisions can be used to extract the\ncharm cross section.

Such a method is only valid based on\ndense sample points. The manifold usually needs to be triangulated into meshes\n(or patches) and each node on the mesh will have an initial value. While the\nmesh is refined the algorithm will provide a smooth function on the redefined\nmanifolds. However, when data points are not dense and the original mesh is not\nallowed to be changed, how is the \"continuous and/or smooth\" reconstruction\npossible? This paper will present a new method using harmonic functions to\nsolve the problem. Our method contains the following steps: (1) Partition the\nboundary surfaces of the 3D manifold based on sample points so that each sample\npoint is on the edge of the partition. (2) Use gradually varied interpolation\non the edges so that each point on edge will be assigned a value. In addition,\nall values on the edge are gradually varied. (3) Use discrete harmonic function\nto fit the unknown points, i.e. the points inside each partition patch.\n  The fitted function will be a harmonic or a local harmonic function in each\npartitioned area. The function on edge will be \"near\" continuous (or \"near\"\ngradually varied). If we need a smoothed surface on the manifold, we can apply\nsubdivision algorithms. This paper has also a philosophical advantage over\ntriangulation meshes. People usually use triangulation for data reconstruction.\nThis paper employs harmonic functions, a generalization of triangulation\nbecause linearity is a form of harmonic. Therefore, local harmonic\ninitialization is more sophisticated then triangulation. This paper is a\nconceptual and methodological paper. This paper does not focus on detailed\nmathematical analysis nor fine algorithm design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 16:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 15:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 02:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-30"}

The present-day models of the\ndissipative phenomena occurring in the interiors of both the Earth and the Moon\nare not able to explain it. We examine several dynamical effects, not modeled\nin the data analysis, in the framework of long-range modified models of gravity\nand of the standard Newtonian/Einsteinian paradigm. It turns out that none of\nthem can accommodate de/dt_meas. Many of them do not even induce long-term\nchanges in e; other models do, instead, yield such an effect, but the resulting\nmagnitudes are in disagreement with de/dt_meas. In particular, the general\nrelativistic gravitomagnetic acceleration of the Moon due to the Earth's\nangular momentum has the right order of magnitude, but the resulting\nLense-Thirring secular effect for the eccentricity vanishes. A potentially\nviable Newtonian candidate would be a trans-Plutonian massive object (Planet\nX/Nemesis/Tyche) since it, actually, would affect e with a non-vanishing\nlong-term variation. On the other hand, the values for the physical and orbital\nparameters of such a hypothetical body required to obtain the right order of\nmagnitude for de/dt are completely unrealistic. Moreover, they are in neat\ndisagreement with both the most recent theoretical scenarios envisaging the\nexistence of a distant, planetary-sized body and with the model-independent\nconstraints on them dynamically inferred from planetary motions.

As the number of\ncall prices increases, these bounds become tighter, and we give two examples\nwhere the densities converge to the Buchen-Kelly density in the sense of\nrelative entropy when we use centered call spreads as proxies for digital\nprices.

Solar physicists have typically\nattempted to understand these complex events using a combination of theoretical\nmodels and observational data. From a statistical perspective, there are many\nchallenges associated with making accurate and statistically significant\ncomparisons between theory and observations, due primarily to the large number\nof free parameters associated with physical models. This class of ill-posed\nstatistical problem is ideally suited to Bayesian methods. In this paper, the\nsolar flare studied by Raftery et al. (2009) is reanalysed using a Bayesian\nframework. This enables us to study the evolution of the flare's temperature,\nemission measure and energy loss in a statistically self-consistent manner.

It suggests that the AGN precessing jets play a role in the\nformation of the misaligned bubbles. Also, X-ray spectra reveal that typically\nthese systems are also able to supress cooling flows, predicted theoretically.\nThe absence of cooling flows in galaxy clusters has been a mistery for many\nyears since numerical simulations and analytical studies suggest that AGN jets\nare highly energetic, but are unable to redistribute it at all directions. We\nperformed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a precessing\nAGN jet and the warm intracluster medium plasma, which dynamics is coupled to a\nNFW dark matter gravitational potential. Radiative cooling has been taken into\naccount and the cooling flow problem was studied. We found that precession is\nresponsible for multiple pairs of bubbles, as observed.

The processes by which gravitational\nenergy is converted into turbulent and magnetic energies, however, remain\npoorly understood. Here, we show with high-resolution, adaptive-mesh\nsimulations that MHD turbulence is efficiently driven by extracting energy from\nthe gravitational potential during the collapse of a dense gas cloud.\nCompressible motions generated during the contraction are converted into\nsolenoidal, turbulent motions, leading to a natural energy ratio of E_sol/E_tot\nof approximately 2/3. We find that the energy injection scale of gravity-driven\nturbulence is close to the local Jeans scale. If small seeds of the magnetic\nfield are present, they are amplified exponentially fast via the small-scale\ndynamo process. The magnetic field grows most efficiently on the smallest\nscales, for which the stretching, twisting, and folding of field lines, and the\nturbulent vortices are sufficiently resolved. We find that this scale\ncorresponds to about 30 grid cells in the simulations. We thus suggest a new\nminimum resolution criterion of 30 cells per Jeans length in\n(magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating gas, in order to\nresolve turbulence on the Jeans scale, and to capture minimum dynamo\namplification of the magnetic field. Due to numerical diffusion, however, any\nexisting simulation today can at best provide lower limits on the physical\ngrowth rates.

Here we report Kepler spacecraft observations of\na single Sun-like star that reveal six transiting planets, five with orbital\nperiods between 10 and 47 days plus a sixth one with a longer period. The five\ninner planets are among the smallest whose masses and sizes have both been\nmeasured, and these measurements imply substantial envelopes of light gases.\nThe degree of coplanarity and proximity of the planetary orbits imply energy\ndissipation near the end of planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 21:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

However, the drizzle algorithm was developed with small, faint,\npartially resolved sources in mind, and is not the best possible algorithm for\nhigh signal-to-noise unresolved objects. Here, a new method for creating\nband-limited images from undersampled data is presented. The method uses a\ndrizzled image as a first order approximation and then rapidly converges toward\na band-limited image which fits the data given the statistical weighting\nprovided by the drizzled image. The method, named iDrizzle, for iterative\nDrizzle, effectively eliminates both the small high-frequency artifacts and\nconvolution with an interpolant kernel that can be introduced by drizzling. The\nmethod works well in the presence of geometric distortion, and can easily\nhandle cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other missing data. It can combine images\ntaken with random dithers, though the number of dithers required to obtain a\ngood final image depends in part on the quality of the dither placements.\niDrizzle may prove most beneficial for producing high-fidelity point spread\nfunctions from undersampled images, and could be particularly valuable for\nfuture Dark Energy missions such as WFIRST and EUCLID, which will likely\nattempt to do high precision supernova photometry and lensing experiments with\nundersampled detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 21:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 20:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In biology, $X$ corresponds to a set\nof taxa (e.g. extant species), the tree $T$ describes their phylogenetic\nrelationships, the edges correspond to earlier species evolving for a time\nuntil splitting in two or more species by some speciation/bifurcation event,\nand their length corresponds to the genetic change accumulating over that time\nin such a species.

We also predict that\nhundreds of < 10^5 Msun black holes fail to merge, and instead populate the\nMilky Way halo, with the most massive of them at roughly the virial radius. In\naddition, we find that there may be hundreds of massive black holes ejected\nfrom their hosts into the nearby intergalactic medium due to gravitational wave\nrecoil. We discuss how the black hole population in the Local Group field\ndwarfs may help to constrain the growth mechanism for Sgr A*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 00:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The range of applications includes communication-systems to\nDNA-sequencing. If there is interference present on a transmitted signal, it\ncould be due to a natural cause or superimposed forcefully. In the latter case,\nits early detection and analysis becomes important. In such situations having a\nsmall observation window, a quick look at power-spectrum can reveal a great\ndeal of information, including frequency and source of interference. In this\npaper, we present our design of a FPGA based reconfigurable platform for high\nperformance power-spectrum analysis.

The main\ncontributions are summarized below.\n  Firstly, we consider QTMs in the unbounded error setting: (i) in some cases\nof sublogarithmic space bounds, the class of languages recognized by QTMs is\nshown to be strictly larger than that of classical ones; (ii) in constant space\nbounds, the same result can still be obtained for restricted QTMs; (iii) the\ncomplete characterization of the class of languages recognized by realtime\nconstant space nondeterministic QTMs is given.\n  Secondly, we consider constant space-bounded QTMs in the bounded error\nsetting: (i) we introduce a new type of quantum and probabilistic finite\nautomata (QFAs and PFAs, respectively,) with a special two-way input head which\nis not allowed to be stationary or move to the left but has the capability to\nreset itself to its starting position; (ii) the computational power of this\ntype of quantum machine is shown to be superior to that of the probabilistic\nmachine; (iii) based on these models, two-way PFAs and two-way classical-head\nQFAs are shown to be more succinct than two-way nondeterministic finite\nautomata and their one-way variants; (iv) we also introduce PFAs and QFAs with\npostselection with their bounded error language classes, and give many\ncharacterizations of them.\n  Thirdly, the computational power of realtime QFAs augmented with a write-only\nmemory is investigated by showing many simulation results for different kinds\nof counter automata.\n  Finally, some lower bounds of realtime classical Turing machines in order to\nrecognize a nonregular language are shown to be tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 08:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-03"}

The general concept of a locally resonant sonic crystal is\nproposed, which utilises acoustic resonances to form additional band gaps that\nare decoupled from Bragg gaps. An existence of a separate attenuation mechanism\nassociated with the resonant elements, which increases performance in the lower\nfrequency regime has been identified.

The normal-state phase diagram as a function of interaction strength\n$U$, temperature $T$, and filling $n$ shows that, upon increasing $n$ towards\nthe Mott insulator, there is a surface of first-order transition between two\nmetals at nonzero doping. That surface ends at a finite temperature critical\nline originating at the half-filled Mott critical point. Associated with this\ntransition, there is a maximum in scattering rate as well as thermodynamic\nsignatures. These findings suggest a new scenario for the normal-state phase\ndiagram of the high temperature superconductors. The criticality surmised in\nthese systems can originate not from a T=0 quantum critical point, nor from the\nproximity of a long-range ordered phase, but from a low temperature transition\nbetween two types of metals at finite doping.

AIMS. In this\ncontribution we highlight the importance to account for the orbital\neccentricity and longitude of periastron of the planetary orbit to accurately\ninterpret the measured planetary radial velocity during the transit. Methods:\nWe calculate the radial velocity of a transiting planet in an eccentric orbit.\nGiven the larger orbital speed of planets with respect to their stellar\ncompanions even small eccentricities can result in detectable blue or redshift\nradial velocity offsets during the transit with respect to the systemic\nvelocity, the exact value depending also on the longitude of the periastron of\nthe planetary orbit. For an hot-jupiter planet, an eccentricity of only e=0.01\ncan produce a radial velocity offset of the order of the km/s. Conclusions: We\npropose an alternative interpretation of the recently claimed radial velocity\nblueshift (~2 km/s) of the planetary spectral lines of HD209458b which implies\nthat the orbit of this system is not exactly circular. In this case, the\nlongitude of the periastron of the stellar orbit is most likely confined in the\nfirst quadrant (and that one of the planet in the third quadrant).

In this paper, we focus on rendezvous\nin trees, and, analogously to the efforts that have been made for solving the\nexploration problem with compact automata, we study the size of memory of\nmobile agents that permits to solve the rendezvous problem deterministically.\nWe assume that the agents are identical, and move in synchronous rounds.\n  We first show that if the delay between the starting times of the agents is\narbitrary, then the lower bound on memory required for rendezvous is Omega(log\nn) bits, even for the line of length n. This lower bound meets a previously\nknown upper bound of O(log n) bits for rendezvous in arbitrary graphs of size\nat most n. Our main result is a proof that the amount of memory needed for\nrendezvous with simultaneous start depends essentially on the number L of\nleaves of the tree, and is exponentially less impacted by the number n of\nnodes. Indeed, we present two identical agents with O(log L + loglog n) bits of\nmemory that solve the rendezvous problem in all trees with at most n nodes and\nat most L leaves. Hence, for the class of trees with polylogarithmically many\nleaves, there is an exponential gap in minimum memory size needed for\nrendezvous between the scenario with arbitrary delay and the scenario with\ndelay zero. Moreover, we show that our upper bound is optimal by proving that\nOmega(log L + loglog n)$ bits of memory are required for rendezvous, even in\nthe class of trees with degrees bounded by 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 15:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}
