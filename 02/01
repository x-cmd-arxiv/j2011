Our results indicate that a large velocity\ndispersion leads to a clump-clump collision-dominated flow which disrupts the\njet beam. Finally, we present synthetic emission images of H-$\\alpha$ and [SII]\nand note an excess of [SII] emission along the jet length as compared to\nobservations. This suggests that observed beams undergo earlier processing, if\nthey are present at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 16:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Quantum light pulses feature an inherent, rich spectral\nbroadband-mode structure. In recent years, exploring the use of integrated\noptics as well as source-engineering has led to a deep understanding of the\npulse-mode structure of guided quantum states of light. In addition, several\ngroups have started to investigate the manipulation of quantum states by means\nof single-photon frequency conversion. In this paper we explore new routes\ntowards complete control of the inherent pulse-modes of ultrafast pulsed\nquantum states by employing specifically designed nonlinear waveguides with\nadapted dispersion properties. Starting from our recently proposed quantum\npulse gate (QPG) we further generalize the concept of spatio-spectral\nengineering for arbitrary $\\chitwo$-based quantum processes. We analyse the\nsum-frequency generation based QPG and introduce the difference-frequency\ngeneration based quantum pulse shaper (QPS). Together, these versatile and\nrobust integrated optics devices allow for arbitrary manipulations of the\npulse-mode structure of ultrafast pulsed quantum states. The QPG can be\nutilized to select an arbitrary pulse mode from a multimode input state,\nwhereas the QPS enables the generation of specific pulse modes from an input\nwavepacket with Gaussian-shaped spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 19:55:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 09:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-29"}

We describe UCDs of\nthis type as giant GCs (GGCs). In contrast, the UCD we have found associated\nwith the isolated S0 NGC4546 is clearly the result of the stripping of a\nnucleated companion galaxy. The young age (~3.4 Gyr) of the UCD, the lack of a\ncorrespondingly young GC population, the apparently short dynamical friction\ndecay timescale (~0.5 Gyr) of the UCD, and the presence of a counterrotating\ngas disc in the host galaxy (co-rotating with the UCD) together suggest that\nthis UCD is the liberated nucleus remaining after the recent stripping of a\ncompanion by NGC4546. We suggest a general scheme that unifies the formation of\nGCs, UCDs, and galaxy nuclei.

We present the\nresults of a SN survey in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). Over a period of 3\nyears, we have observed the SDF on 4 independent epochs with Suprime-Cam on the\nSubaru 8.2-m telescope, with 2 nights of exposure per epoch, in the R, i', and\nz' bands.

We investigate this issue\nby computing spectra of numerically calculated models of thin accretion discs\naround black holes, obtained via three-dimensional general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. We apply the continuum fitting method\nto these computed spectra to estimate the black hole spins and check how\nclosely the values match the actual spin used in the GRMHD simulations. We find\nthat the error in the dimensionless spin parameter is up to about 0.2 for a\nnon-spinning black hole, depending on the inclination. For black holes with\nspins of 0.7, 0.9 and 0.98, the errors are up to about 0.1, 0.03 and 0.01\nrespectively. These errors are comparable to or smaller than those arising from\ncurrent levels of observational uncertainty. Furthermore, we estimate that the\nGRMHD simulated discs from which these error estimates are obtained correspond\nto effective disc luminosities of about 0.4-0.7 Eddington, and that the errors\nwill be smaller for discs with luminosities of 0.3 Eddington or less, which are\nused in the continuum-fitting method. We thus conclude that use of the\nNovikov-Thorne thin-disc model does not presently limit the accuracy of the\ncontinuum-fitting method of measuring black hole spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 21:07:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 21:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In the squashed Kaluza-Klein G\\\"{o}del black hole spacetime, the\nphoton sphere radius, the minimum impact parameter, the coefficient $\\bar{a}$,\n$\\bar{b}$ and the deflection angle $\\alpha(\\theta)$ in the $\\phi$ direction are\nindependent of whether the photon goes with or against the global rotation of\nthe G\\\"{o}del Universe. While in the Kerr black hole, the values of these\nquantities for the prograde photons are different from those for the retrograde\nphotons. Moreover, the coefficient of $\\bar{b}$ increases with $j$ in the\nsquashed Kaluza-Klein G\\\"{o}del black hole, but decreases with $a$ in the Kerr\ncase. We also probe the influence of the squashed effect on the strong\ngravitational lensing in this black hole and find that in the extremely\nsquashed case $\\rho_0=0$, the coefficient $\\bar{a}$ is a constant 1 and is\nindependent of the global rotation of the G\\\"{o}del Universe. Furthermore, we\nassume that the gravitational field of the supermassive central object of the\nGalaxy can be described by this metric and estimate the numerical values of the\ncoefficients and the main observables in the strong gravitational lensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 06:50:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 05:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

The need for such a\nsystem arose in the context of an ongoing program for reconfiguring the Ooty\nRadio Telescope (ORT) as a programmable 264-element array, which will enable\nseveral new observing capabilities for large scale surveys on this mature\ntelescope. For this application, it is necessary to manage, route and combine\nlarge volumes of data whose real-time collation requires large I/O bandwidths\nto be sustained. Since these are general requirements of many multi-sensor\nfusion applications, we first describe the basic architecture of the NSPS in\nterms of a Fusion Tree before elaborating on its application for the ORT. The\npaper addresses issues relating to high speed distributed data acquisition,\nField Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based peer-to-peer networks supporting\nsignificant on-the fly processing while routing, and providing a last mile\ninterface to a typical commodity network like Gigabit Ethernet. The system is\nfundamentally a pair of two co-operative networks, among which one is part of a\ncommodity high performance computer cluster and the other is based on\nCommercial-Off The-Shelf (COTS) technology with support from software/firmware\ncomponents in the public domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 12:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-02"}

Since period doubling\nwas observed only in Blazhko-modulated stars so far, the phenomenon can help in\nthe understanding of the modulation as well. Utilising the Florida-Budapest\nturbulent convective hydrodynamical code, we identified the phenomenon in\nradiative and convective models as well. A period-doubling cascade was also\nfollowed up to an eight-period solution confirming that the destabilisation of\nthe limit cycle is indeed the underlying phenomenon. Floquet stability roots\nwere calculated to investigate the possible causes and occurrences of the\nphenomenon. A two-dimensional diagnostic diagram was constructed to display the\nvarious resonances between the fundamental mode and the different overtones.\nCombining the two tools, we confirmed that the period-doubling instability is\ncaused by a 9:2 resonance between the 9th overtone and the fundamental mode.\nDestabilisation of the limit cycle by a resonance of a high-order mode is\npossible because the overtone is a strange mode. The resonance is found to be\nsufficiently strong enough to shift the period of overtone with up to 10\npercent. Our investigations suggest that a more complex interplay of radial\n(and presumably non-radial) modes could happen in RR Lyrae stars that might\nhave connections with the Blazhko effect as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 13:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The equilibria reflect the correlation structure of the\ninputs, a global object extracted through local recurrent interactions only.\nSecond, we use numerical methods to illustrate how learning extracts the hidden\ngeometrical structure of the inputs.

The plasma is taken to be\naxisymmetric and subject to the action of slowly time-varying gravitational and\nelectromagnetic fields. The magnetic field is assumed to be characterized by a\nfamily of locally nested but open magnetic surfaces. The slow collisionless\ndynamics of these plasmas is investigated, yielding a reduced gyrokinetic\nVlasov equation for the kinetic distribution function.

When a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the kagome\nplane, magnetizations in the ordered state show a sudden increase at a critical\nfield H_c, indicative of the transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic\nstates. This sudden increase arises as the spins on alternate kagome planes\nrotate 180 degrees to ferromagnetically align the canted moments along the\nfield direction. The canted moment on a single kagome plane is a result of the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. For H < H_c, the weak ferromagnetic\ninterlayer coupling forces the spins to align in such an arrangement that the\ncanted components on any two adjacent layers are equal and opposite, yielding a\nzero net magnetic moment. For H > H_c, the Zeeman energy overcomes the\ninterlayer coupling causing the spins on the alternate layers to rotate,\naligning the canted moments along the field direction. Neutron scattering\nmeasurements provide the first direct evidence of this 180-degree spin rotation\nat the transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 15:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-24"}
