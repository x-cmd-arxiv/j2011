In a recent\npublication, the lift force has been suggested to be a source to disk tilt, a\nsource that is likely relevant to all accretion disk systems. Lift is generated\nby slightly different supersonic gas stream speeds flowing over and under the\ndisk at the bright spot. In this conference proceeding, we focus on whether a\nbrown dwarf donor star accreting onto a white dwarf primary has enough mass to\ncontribute to disk tilt. We also would like to obtain whether a white dwarf -\nbrown dwarf close binary system has enough mass to induce and maintain a disk\ntilt of four degrees. We adopt SDSS 103533.03+055158.4 as our model system\nwhich has a mass transfer rate of (10 \\pm 2) x 10-12 M* yr-1. We find that the\nbrown dwarf in SDSS 1035 does not have enough mass to contribute to disk tilt.\nWe find a gross magnitude of the minimum mass transfer rate to be - 10-10 M*\nyr-1 . We conclude that SDSS 1035 does not seem to have a high enough mass\ntransfer rate to induce and maintain an observable disk tilt. Hence one reason\nwhy brown dwarf donor systems may be so difficult to find could be due to their\nlow mass transfer rates which do not induce observable dynamical effects that\nis typical in white dwarf-red dwarf CVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 17:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

In each\nof the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing\nradiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In\nthe near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force\nthat prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background\nspacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because\nof its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But\nit is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no\nforce on the particle. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is\nfully responsible for the self-force. The mathematical tools required to derive\nthe equations of motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and\na point mass in a specified background spacetime are developed here from\nscratch.

A straightforward Monte-Carlo routine would enclose the\nenergy constrained manifold within a larger manifold, which is easy to sample,\nfor example, a hypercube. The efficiency of such a sampling routine decreases\nexponentially with the increase of the dimension of the Hilbert space, because\nthe volume of the enclosing manifold becomes exponentially larger than the\nvolume of the manifold of interest. The present paper explores the ways to\noptimise the above routine by varying the shapes of the manifolds enclosing the\nenergy-constrained manifold. The resulting improvement in the sampling\nefficiency is about a factor of five for a 14-dimensional Hilbert space. The\nadvantage of the above algorithm is that it does not compromise on the rigorous\nstatistical nature of the sampling outcome and hence can be used to test other\nmore sophisticated Monte-Carlo routines. The present attempts to optimise the\nenclosing manifolds also bring insights into the geometrical properties of the\nenergy constrained manifold itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 18:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

For the present study we select a homogeneous\nsample covering about 675 square degrees in the direction of the NGP. It\ncontains nearly 670,000 MS stars with apparent magnitudes between 15 and 20.5\nmag and spectral classes later than G5. The data were taken from the SDSS. We\nconstruct the two-point correlation function (2PCF) for angular separations\nbetween 2 and 30 arcsecs. The resulting clustering signal is modeled by means\nof the Wasserman-Weinberg technique. We show that the distribution of\nsemi-major axis is consistent with the canonical Oepik law and infer that about\n10% of all stars in the solar neighbourhood belong to a WB system. To reduce\nthe noise from optical pairs and to increase the sensitivity of the analysis at\nlarger separations, we include distance information from photometric\nparallaxes. Introducing a novel weighting procedure based on the binding\nprobability of a double star, we infer the distribution of colours and mass\nratios, which were carefully corrected for observational selection effects.\nAbout 4,000 WBs were taken into account statistically, whose components have\nmasses between 0.2 and 0.85 solar masses. We find that the WB colour\ndistribution is in accord with the colour distribution of single field stars.\nHowever, pairs with a mass difference exceeding 0.5 solar masses seem to be\nsystematically underrepresented as compared to a random pairing of field stars.\nOur results are broadly in agreement with prior studies but a direct comparison\nis difficult and often impossible. The novel procedure presented in this thesis\ncan be regarded as complementary to common proper motion studies, and\nconstitutes a viable approach to study the statistical properties of WBs in the\nGalactic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 19:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-03"}

NASA's Kepler mission has identified\n1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011). The method of transit\ntiming variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary\nsystems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a). We perform a transit\ntiming analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of\nplanet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive\nof TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span\nof observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet\nmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple\ntransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We\nfind that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does\nnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per\nstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a\nsingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We\nanticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with\nmultiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a\npowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital\ndynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least\nsix years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the\ndynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive\nto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 20:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 18:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

The discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by NASA's Kepler\nmission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution of\nsmall exoplanets. Measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is only\npractical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques\n(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).\nYet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to study\nthe distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transit\ndurations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). We\nanalyze the transit duration distribution of Kepler planet candidates. We find\nthat for host stars with T_eff > 5100 K we cannot invert this to infer the\neccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possible\nsystematics in the host star densities. With this limitation in mind, we\ncompare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule out\nextreme distributions. If we assume a Rayleigh eccentricity distribution for\nKepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of\n0.1-0.25 for host stars with T_eff < 5100 K. We compare the transit duration\ndistribution for different subsets of Kepler planet candidates and discuss\ntentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. High-precision\nspectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will be\nrequired to confirm which trends are real and which are the results of\nsystematic errors in stellar radii. Finally, we identify planet candidates that\nmust be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 20:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The conventional matching procedure\ncoupled with the integral Lippmann-Schwinger equations technique are used in\nthe formal theoretical basis of this approach. The reformulated scattering\nproblem is suitable for application in the exterior complex scaling technique:\nthe practical advantage is that after the complex scaling the problem is\nreduced to a boundary problem with zero boundary conditions. The Coulomb wave\nfunctions are used only at a single point: if this point is chosen to be at a\nsufficiently large distance, on using the asymptotic expansion of Coulomb\nfunctions, one may completely avoid the Coulomb functions in the calculations.\nThe theoretical results are illustrated with numerical calculations for two\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 20:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}

To avoid using\na jet veto, one can consider inclusive observables, in which every particle is\nin a jet. We demonstrate that calculating the mass of the hardest jet in\nmultijet events can be problematic, and we give an example of an inclusive\nobservable, asymmetric thrust, which can be resummed to next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy. Exclusive observables with out-of-jet regions are more\ncomplicated. Even for e+e- dijet events at energy Q, to calculate the mass m of\njets of size R, one must impose a veto on the energy omega of extra jets to\nforce dijet kinematics; then there are both log m/Q and log m/omega\nsingularities. To proceed, we suggest a refactorization of the soft function in\nthe small R limit. To justify this refactorization, we show that the expansion\nof the resummed distribution is in excellent agreement with fixed order. This\nmotivates considering the expansion around small R as a useful handle on\nproducing phenomenologically useful resummed jet mass distributions. The strong\nevidence we give for refactorization at small R is independent of non-global\nlogarithms, which are not the subject of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 21:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 18:46:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 20:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

We\nnumerically calculate the density of states, optical conductivity, and inverse\nparticipation ratio for the models on the pyrochlore, checkerboard, and kagome\nlattices, and discuss the nature of metal-insulator transitions at commensurate\nfillings. As a result, we show that the ice-rule local constraint leads to\nseveral universal features in the electronic structure; a charge gap opens at a\nconsiderably small U compared to the bandwidth, and the energy spectrum\napproaches a characteristic form in the large U limit, that is, the\nnoninteracting tight-binding form in one dimension or the $\\delta$-functional\npeak. In the large U region, the itinerant fermions are confined in the\nmacroscopically-degenerate ice-rule configurations, which consist of a bunch of\none-dimensional loops: We call this insulating state the charge ice.

When the density\ndistribution \\psi_{n}(t) for the occurrence of the n-th event at time t is\nconsidered to be a partition function, of a 'microcanonical' type for n\n'degrees of freedom' at fixed 'energy' t, one obtains a set of four partition\nfunctions of which that for the generating function variable z and Laplace\ntransform variable \\epsilon, conjugate to n and t, respectively, plays a\ncentral role. These partition functions relate to each other in the customary\nway and in accordance to the precepts of large deviations theory, while the\nentropy, or Massieu potential, derived from \\psi_{n}(t) satisfies an Euler\nrelation. We illustrate this scheme first for an ordinary renewal process of\nevents generated by a simple exponential waiting time distribution \\psi (t).\nThen we examine a process modelled after the so-called Hamiltonian Mean Field\n(HMF) model that is representative of agents that perform a repeated task with\nan associated outcome, such as an opinion poll. When a sequence of (many)\nevents takes place in a sufficiently short time the process exhibits clustering\nof the outcome, but for larger times the process resembles that of independent\nevents. The two regimes are separated by a sharp transition, technically of the\nsecond order. Finally we point out the existence of a similar scheme for random\nwalk processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 01:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In particular, for accessing\ninformation within a scale comparable to the cell size where interactions\nbetween cell membrane and other organelle structures occur, micron size spatial\nresolution is required. Due to the large wavelength, however, the joint\ncapability of THz near-field imaging with real-time acquisition, which is a\nhighly desirable ability for observing real-time changes of in vivo sample,\nremains undone.

However, there is intrinsic tension between shortcuts generating\nsmall-worlds and the persistence of modularity; a global property unrelated to\nlocal clustering. Here, we present a possible solution to this puzzle. We first\nshow that a modified percolation theory can define a set of hierarchically\norganized modules made of strong links in functional brain networks. These\nmodules are \"large-world\" self-similar structures and, therefore, are far from\nbeing small-world. However, incorporating weaker ties to the network converts\nit into a small-world preserving an underlying backbone of well-defined\nmodules. Remarkably, weak ties are precisely organized as predicted by theory\nmaximizing information transfer with minimal wiring cost. This trade-off\narchitecture is reminiscent of the \"strength of weak ties\" crucial concept of\nsocial networks.

We use a Lagrangian framework to decompose\nthe bispectrum into \"3-halo\", \"2-halo\", and \"1-halo\" contributions, related to\n\"perturbative\" and \"non-perturbative\" terms. We describe a simple\nimplementation of this approach and present a detailed comparison with\nnumerical simulations. We show that the 1-halo and 2-halo contributions contain\ncounterterms that ensure their decay at low $k$, as required by physical\nconstraints, and allow a better match to simulations. Contrary to the power\nspectrum, the standard 1-loop perturbation theory can be used for the\nperturbative 3-halo contribution because it does not grow too fast at high $k$.\nMoreover, it is much simpler and more accurate than two resummation schemes\ninvestigated in this paper. We obtain a good agreement with numerical\nsimulations on both large and small scales, but the transition scales are\npoorly described by the simplest implementation. This cannot be amended by\nsimple modifications to the halo parameters, but we show how it can be\ncorrected for the power spectrum and the bispectrum through a simple\ninterpolation scheme that is restricted to this intermediate regime.

We show a model\nbased on canonical physics and astrophysics for SGRs and AXPs powered by\nmassive highly magnetized rotating white dwarfs (WDs), in total analogy with\npulsars powered by rotating neutron stars (NSs). We predict for SGR 0418+5729 a\nlower limit for its spin-down rate, $\\dot{P} \\geq L_X P^3/(4\\pi^2 I)=1.18\\times\n10^{-16}$ where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the WD. We show for SGRs and\nAXPs that, the occurrence of the glitch and the gain of rotational energy, is\ndue to the release of gravitational energy associated to the contraction and\ndecrease of the moment of inertia of the WDs. The steady emission and the\noutburst following the glitch are explained by the loss of rotational energy of\nthe Wds, in view of the much larger moment of inertia of the WDs, as compared\nto the one of NSs and/or quark stars. There is no need here to invoke the\nunorthodox concept of magnetic energy release due to decay of overcritical\nmagnetic fields, as assumed in the magnetar model. A new astrophysical scenario\nfor the SGRs and AXPs associated to Supernova remnants is presented. The\nobservational campaigns of the X-ray Japanese satellite Suzaku on AE Aquarii\nand the corresponding theoretical works by Japanese groups and recent results\nof the Hubble Space Telescope, give crucial information for our theoretical\nmodel. Follow-on missions of Hubble Telescope and VLT are highly recommended to\ngive further observational evidence of this most fundamental issue of\nrelativistic astrophysics: the identification of the true SGRs/AXPs energy\nsource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 11:48:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 09:30:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 14:59:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 15:56:38 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 10:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 17:53:58 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 21:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We compare the different models both by looking at the\nbehaviour of integrated quantities such as the mean CO fraction or the\ncloud-averaged CO-to-H2 conversion factor, and also by studying the detailed\ndistribution of CO as a function of gas density and visual extinction. In\naddition, we examine the extent to which the density and temperature\ndistributions depend on our choice of chemical model.\n  We find that all of the models predict the same density PDF and also agree\nvery well on the form of the temperature PDF for temperatures T > 30 K,\nalthough at lower temperatures, some differences become apparent. All of the\nmodels also predict the same CO-to-H2 conversion factor, to within a factor of\na few. However, when we look more closely at the details of the CO\ndistribution, we find larger differences. The more complex models tend to\nproduce less CO and more atomic carbon than the simpler models, suggesting that\nthe C/CO ratio may be a useful observational tool for determining which model\nbest fits the observational data. Nevertheless, the fact that these chemical\ndifferences do not appear to have a strong effect on the density or temperature\ndistributions of the gas suggests that the dynamical behaviour of the molecular\nclouds on large scales is not particularly sensitive to how accurately the\nsmall-scale chemistry is modelled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 12:56:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2011 14:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Such a\nflow could account for the presence of crystalline silicates, including\ncalcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), at large distances from the sun.\nThis paper aims at examining whether such large-scale flows exist in turbulent\nprotoplanetary disks. High-resolution global hydrodynamical and\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations of turbulent protoplanetary\ndisks were used to infer the properties of the flow in such disks. By\nperforming hydrodynamic simulations using explicit viscosity, we demonstrate\nthat our numerical setup does not suffer from any numerical artifact. The\naforementioned meridional circulation is easily recovered in viscous and\nlaminar disks and is quickly established. In MHD simulations, the\nmagnetorotational instability drives turbulence in the disks. Averaging out the\nturbulent fluctuations on a long timescale, the results fail to show any\nlarge-scale meridional circulation. A detailed analysis of the simulations show\nthat this lack of meridional circulation is due to the turbulent stress tensor\nhaving a vertical profile different from the viscous stress tensor. A simple\nmodel is provided that successfully accounts for the structure of the flow in\nthe bulk of the disk. In addition to those results, possible deviations from\nstandard vertically averaged alpha disk models are suggested by the simulations\nand should be the focus of future work. Global MHD numerical simulations of\nfully ionized and turbulent protoplanetary disks are not consistent with the\nexistence of a large-scale meridional flow. As a consequence, the presence of\ncrystalline silicates at large distance for the central star cannot be\naccounted for by that process as suggested by recent models based on viscous\ndisk theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 13:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 13:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We point out an apparent paradox between two (in principle\nequivalent) pictures of black hole evaporation through Hawking radiation. In\nthe picture in which the evaporation is due to the emission of positive-energy\nmodes, one immediately obtains a threshold for the emission of massive\nparticles. In the picture in which the evaporation is due to the absorption of\nnegative-energy modes, such a threshold apparently does not exist. We resolve\nthis paradox by tracing the evolution of the positive-energy massive modes with\nan energy below the threshold.

Reconnection is\nassumed to happen in a small patch across a Syrovatski\\'i (non-uniform) current\nsheet (CS) with skewed magnetic fields. The background magnetic pressure has\nits maximum at the center of the CS plane, and decreases toward the edges of\nthe plane. The reconnection patch creates two V-shaped reconnected tubes that\nshorten as they retract in opposite directions, due to magnetic tension. One of\nthem moves upward toward the top edge of the CS, and the other one moves\ndownward toward the top of the underlying arcade. Rotational discontinuities\n(RDs) propagate along the legs of the tubes and generate parallel super-sonic\nflows that collide at the center of the tube. There, gas dynamics shocks that\ncompress and heat the plasma are launched outwardly. The descending tube moves\nthrough the bottom part of the CS where it expands laterally in response to the\nbackground magnetic pressure. This effect may decrease plasma density by 30 %\nto 50 % of background levels. This tube will arrive at the top of the arcade\nthat will slow it down to a stop. Here, the perpendicular dynamics is halted,\nbut the parallel dynamics continues along its legs; the RDs are shut down, and\nthe gas is rarified to even lower densities.

The focus of this paper is on\ndetermining the input behavior, and specifically, a prior distribution which is\nused to randomly generate the codebook. We pose the problem of setting the\nprior as a sequential universal prediction problem, that attempts to approach a\ngiven target rate, which depends on the unknown channel sequence. The main\nresult is that, for a channel comprised of an unknown, arbitrary sequence of\nmemoryless channels, there is a system using feedback and common randomness\nthat asymptotically attains, with high probability, the capacity of the\ntime-averaged channel, universally for every sequence of channels. While no\nprior knowledge of the channel sequence is assumed, the rate achieved meets or\nexceeds the traditional arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) capacity for every\nmemoryless AVC defined over the same alphabets, and therefore the system\nuniversally attains the random code AVC capacity, without knowledge of the AVC\nparameters. The system we present combines rateless coding with a universal\nprediction scheme for the prior. We present rough upper bounds on the rates\nthat can be achieved in this setting and lower bounds for the redundancies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 15:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 14:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 12:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-03"}

We provide a characterization of the\nlimiting parameter via a local recursion defined directly on the limit of the\ngraph sequence. Interestingly, the recursion may admit multiple solutions,\nimplying non-trivial long-range dependencies between the covered vertices. We\novercome this lack of correlation decay by introducing a perturbative parameter\n(temperature), which we let progressively go to zero. This allows us to\nuniquely identify the correct solution. In the important case where the graph\nlimit is a unimodular Galton-Watson tree, the recursion simplifies into a\ndistributional equation that can be solved explicitly, leading to a new\nasymptotic formula that considerably extends the well-known one by Karp and\nSipser for Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi random graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 15:53:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 16:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-12"}

Final Project Thesis","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.AI","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  One of the main research areas in Artificial Intelligence is the coding of\nagents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This\nmeans that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were\ncreated for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer\nto the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide\nwhether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its\nintelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way.\nThe purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the\nexecution of several environments, including those which are generated\nrandomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once\nthe interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter\nwill measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and\nrewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a\nresult we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible\nenvironment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to\ndetermine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests,\nthe interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really\nuseful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated\nenvironment will serve that purpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 15:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-04"}
