The challenge comes\nfrom the fact that the services provided by an institutional electronic library\ndepend upon the contents requested by the users and the contents housed by the\nlibrary. Different types of users might be interested in different types of\ncontents. In this paper, we propose a technique for evaluating the service\nquality of an institutional electronic library. Our scheme is based on the\nservice profiles of contents requested by the users at the server side which is\nhosted at the library. Further, we propose models to analyze the service\nquality of an electronic library. For analyzing the service quality, we present\ntwo analytical models. The first one is based on the number of days by which\nthe item to be served by the library is delayed and the penalty points per day\nfor the duration for which the item is delayed. The second model is based on\nthe credits earned by the library if the item is served in a timely fashion,\nand the penalties, thereof, if the item is delayed. These models may help in\nevaluating the service quality of an electronic library and taking the\ncorrective measures to improve it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2011 16:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 15:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Here, we analyze\nthe self-gravity of the forming circumstellar disk as the potential major\ndriver of the angular momentum transport in such massive disks responsible for\nthe high accretion rates needed for the formation of massive stars. For this\npurpose, we perform self-gravity radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the\ncollapse of massive pre-stellar cores. The formation and evolution of the\nresulting circumstellar disk is investigated in 1.) axially symmetric\nsimulations using an alpha-shear-viscosity prescription and 2.) a\nthree-dimensional simulation, in which the angular momentum transport is\nprovided self-consistently by developing gravitational torques in the\nself-gravitating accretion disk. The simulation series of different strength of\nthe alpha-viscosity shows that the accretion history of the forming star is\nmostly independent of the alpha-viscosity-parameter. The accretion history of\nthe three-dimensional run driven by self-gravity is more time-dependent than\nthe viscous disk evolution in axial symmetry. The mean accretion rate, i.e. the\nstellar mass growth, is nearly identical to the alpha-viscosity models. We\nconclude that the development of gravitational torques in self-gravitating\ndisks around forming massive stars provides a self-consistent mechanism to\nefficiently transport the angular momentum to outer disk radii.

The results on the existence of\ncapacity achieving linear codes in the literature are limited to the random\nbinary codes with equal probability generating matrix elements and sparse\nparity-check matrices. Moreover, the codes with sparse generating matrices\nreported in the literature are not proved to be capacity achieving.\n  As opposed to the existing results in the literature, which are based on\noptimal maximum a posteriori decoders, the proposed approach is based on a\ndifferent decoder and consequently is suboptimal. We also demonstrate an\ninteresting trade-off between the sparsity of the generating matrix and the\nerror exponent (a constant which determines how exponentially fast the\nprobability of error decays as block length tends to infinity). An interesting\nobservation is that for small block sizes, less sparse generating matrices have\nbetter performances while for large blok sizes, the performance of the random\ngenerating matrices become independent of the sparsity. Moreover, we prove the\nexistence of capacity achieving linear codes with a given (arbitrarily low)\ndensity of ones on rows of the generating matrix. In addition to proving the\nexistence of capacity achieving sparse codes, an important conclusion of our\npaper is that for a sufficiently large code length, no search is necessary in\npractice to find a deterministic matrix by proving that any arbitrarily\nselected sequence of sparse generating matrices is capacity achieving with high\nprobability. The focus in this paper is on the binary symmetric and binary\nerasure channels.her discrete memory-less symmetric channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2011 19:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 14:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 02:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

According\nto this mechanism, rotational transition of the flake from commensurate to\nincommensurate states takes place with subsequent simultaneous rotation and\ntranslational motion until the commensurate state is reached again, and so on.\nThe molecular dynamics simulations and analytic estimates based on ab initio\nand semi-empirical calculations demonstrate that the proposed diffusion\nmechanism is dominant at temperatures T ~ Tcom, where Tcom corresponds to the\nbarrier for transitions of the flake between adjacent energy minima in the\ncommensurate states. For example, for the flake consisting of ~ 40, 200 and 700\natoms the contribution of the proposed diffusion mechanism through rotation of\nthe flake to the incommensurate states exceeds that for diffusion of the flake\nin the commensurate states by one-two orders of magnitude at temperatures 50 -\n150 K, 200 - 600 K and 800 - 2400 K, respectively. The possibility to\nexperimentally measure the barriers to relative motion of graphene layers based\non the study of diffusion of a graphene flake is considered.

Such patterns have\ndemonstrated considerable value for classification and subgroup discovery, but\na detailed understanding of the types of interactions among items in a\ndiscriminative pattern is lacking. To address this issue, we propose to\ncategorize discriminative patterns according to four types of item interaction:\n(i) driver-passenger, (ii) coherent, (iii) independent additive and (iv)\nsynergistic beyond independent additive. Either of the last three is of\npractical importance, with the latter two representing a gain in the\ndiscriminative power of a pattern over its subsets. Synergistic patterns are\nmost restrictive, but perhaps the most interesting since they capture a\ncooperative effect. For domains such as genetic research, differentiating among\nthese types of patterns is critical since each yields very different biological\ninterpretations. For general domains, the characterization provides a novel\nview of the nature of the discriminative patterns in a dataset, which yields\ninsights beyond those provided by current approaches that focus mostly on\npattern-based classification and subgroup discovery. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive discussion that defines these four pattern types and investigates\ntheir properties and their relationship to one another. In addition, these\nideas are explored for a variety of datasets (ten UCI datasets, one gene\nexpression dataset and two genetic-variation datasets). The results demonstrate\nthe existence, characteristics and statistical significance of the different\ntypes of patterns. They also illustrate how pattern characterization can\nprovide novel insights into discriminative pattern mining and the\ndiscriminative structure of different datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2011 21:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-22"}

Most of the\nnewly discovered objects lie in regions surveyed previously, indicating both\nthe improved sensitivity of the HTRU survey observing system and the dynamic\nnature of the radio sky.

A desired preference relation can be expressed with (i) a\nquantitative language, which is a function assigning a value to every possible\nbehavior of a system, and (ii) an environment model defining the desired\noptimization criteria of the system, e.g., worst-case or average-case optimal.\n  In this paper, we show how to synthesize a system that is optimal for (i) a\nquantitative language given by an automaton with a ratio cost function, and\n(ii) an environment model given by a labeled Markov decision process. The\nobjective of the system is to minimize the expected (ratio) costs. The solution\nis based on a reduction to Markov Decision Processes with ratio cost functions\nwhich do not require that the costs in the denominator are strictly positive.\nWe find an optimal strategy for these using a fractional linear program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 02:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-22"}

We consider the\nhomogeneous spaces with positive Euler characteristic. It is well known that\nsuch spaces carry many stable complex structures equivariant under the\ncanonical action of the maximal torus $T^k$. As the torus action in this case\nhas only isolated fixed points it is possible to effectively apply localization\nformula for the universal toric genus. Using this we prove that the famous\ntopological results related to rigidity and multiplicativity of a Hirzebruch\ngenus can be obtained on homogeneous spaces just using representation theory.\nIn that context for homogeneous $SU$-spaces we prove the well known result\nabout rigidity of the Krichever genus.

Cooperative spectrum sharing is one effective way to achieve\nthis goal. In cooperative spectrum sharing, secondary users (SUs) relay\ntraffics for primary users (PUs), in exchange for dedicated transmission time\nfor the SUs' own communication needs. In this paper, we study the cooperative\nspectrum sharing under incomplete information, where SUs' types (capturing\ntheir heterogeneity in relay channel gains and evaluations of power\nconsumptions) are private information and not known by PUs. Inspired by the\ncontract theory, we model the network as a labor market. The single PU is the\nemployer who offers a contract to the SUs. The contract consists of a set of\ncontract items representing combinations of spectrum accessing time (i.e.,\nreward) and relaying power (i.e., contribution). The SUs are employees, and\neach of them selects the best contract item to maximize his payoff. We study\nthe optimal contract design for both weak and strong incomplete information\nscenarios. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for feasible\ncontracts in both scenarios. In the weak incomplete information scenario, we\nfurther derive the optimal contract that achieves the same maximum PU's utility\nas in the complete information benchmark. In the strong incomplete information\nscenario, we propose a Decompose-and-Compare algorithm that achieves a\nclose-to-optimal contract. We future show that the PU's average utility loss\ndue to the suboptimal algorithm and the strong incomplete information are both\nrelatively small (less than 2% and 1:3%, respectively, in our numerical results\nwith two SU types).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 10:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Diversity results in users having different preferences for the\nquality requirements of a system. Diversity also makes possible alternative\nimplementations for functional requirements, called variants, each of them\nproviding different quality. The quality provided by the system may vary due to\ndifferent variant components and changes in the environment. The challenge is\nto dynamically adapt to quality variations and to find the variant that best\nfulfills the multi-criteria quality requirements driven by user preferences and\ncurrent runtime conditions. For service-oriented systems this challenge is\naugmented by their distributed nature and lack of control over the constituent\nservices and their provided quality of service (QoS). We propose a novel\napproach to runtime adaptability that detects QoS changes, updates the system\nmodel with runtime information, and uses the model to select the variant to\nexecute at runtime. We introduce negotiable maintenance goals to express user\nquality preferences in the requirements model and automatically interpret them\nquantitatively for system execution.

From a cosmochemical and\nastrobiological perspective the study of the H, C, N, and O isotopes on Earth\nand Titan could be the key to decipher the processes occurred in the early\nstages of formation of both planetary bodies. The main goal of this paper is to\nquantify the presumable ways of chemical evolution of both planetary bodies, in\nparticular the abundance of CO and N2 in their early atmospheres.

It generates a direct current in the absence of an applied voltage\nexploiting the time-dependence of some properties of a nano-scale conductor.\nThe idea of pumping in nanostructures was discussed theoretically a few decades\nago [1-4]. So far, nano-scale pumps have been realised only in system\nexhibiting strong Coulombic effects [5-12], whereas evidence for pumping in the\nabsence of Coulomb-blockade has been elusive. A pioneering experiment by\nSwitkes et al.

The model incorporates physical knowledge\nabout the underlying processes that determine rainfall, such as advection,\ndiffusion and convection.

In the\napplication, the statistical model combines forecasts of three other\nmeteorological variables obtained from a numerical weather prediction model\nwith past precipitation observations. The model is then used to predict\nthree-hourly precipitation over 24 hours.

Lowering the temperature the approach exhibits two\ncrossover temperatures: at the higher crossover a finite density of incoherent\nholon pairs are formed leading to a reduction of the hole spectral weight, at\nthe lower crossover also a finite density of incoherent spinon RVB pairs are\nformed, giving rise to a gas of incoherent preformed hole pairs, and magnetic\nvortices appear in the plasma phase.
