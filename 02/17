Fermion masses arise at a large energy\nscale through an unknown mechanism, and the standard model at the electroweak\nscale is regarded as an effective field theory. In this scenario, Higgs boson\ndecays into photons and electroweak gauge-boson pairs are considerably enhanced\nfor a light Higgs boson, which makes a signal observation at the LHC\nstraightforward. On the other hand, the clean environment of a linear collider\nis required to directly probe the radiative fermionic sector of the Higgs boson\ncouplings. Also, we show that the flavor-changing Higgs-boson decays are\ndramatically enhanced with respect to the standard model. In particular, we\nfind a measurable branching ratio in the range (10^{-4}-10^{-3}) for the decay\nH\\to bs for a Higgs boson lighter than 140 GeV, depending on the high-energy\nscale where Yukawa couplings vanish.

To overcome this problem, Vontobel et al.\ndeveloped an iterative Low-Complexity LP (LCLP) decoding algorithm for binary\nLDPC codes. The variable and check node calculations of binary LCLP decoding\nalgorithm are related to those of binary Belief Propagation (BP).

At low redshift we compiled a\nsubsample of 2,656 elliptical galaxies from SDSS, whereas at higher redshift\n(up to z~1) we extracted a sample of 228 object from the HST/ACS images of the\nGOODS. All the galaxies in our study have spectroscopic data, allowing us to\ndetermine the age and mass of the stellar component. Using the fossil record\ninformation contained in the stellar populations of our local sample, we do not\nfind any evidence for an age segregation at a given stellar mass depending on\nthe size of the galaxies. At a fixed dynamical mass there is only a <9% size\ndifference in the two extreme age quartiles of our sample. Consequently, the\nlocal evidence does not support a scenario whereby the present-day mass-size\nrelation has been progressively established via a bottom-up sequence, where\nolder galaxies occupy the lower part this relation, remaining in place since\ntheir formation. We find a trend in size that is insensitive to the age of the\nstellar populations, at least since z~1. This result supports the idea that the\nstellar mass-size relation is formed at z~1, with all galaxies populating a\nregion which roughly corresponds to 1/2 of the present size distribution. The\nfact that the evolution in size is independent of stellar age, together with\nthe absence of an increase in the scatter of the relationship with redshift\ndoes not support the puffing up mechanism. The observational evidence, however,\ncan not reject at this stage the minor merging hypothesis. We have made an\nestimation of the number of minor merger events necessary to bring the high-z\ngalaxies into the local relation compatible with the observed size evolution.\nSince z=0.8, if the merger mass ratio is 1:3 we estimate ~3+-1 minor mergers\nand if the ratio is 1:10 we obtain ~8+-2 events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 18:39:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2011 16:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The liquid drop impacts the granular layer with a low speed (~ m/s). The\ndrop deformation and penetration are captured by a high speed camera. From the\nvideo data, characteristic time scales are measured. Using a laser profilometry\nsystem, resultant crater morphology and its characteristic length scales are\nmeasured. Static strength of the granular layer is also measured by the slow\npillar penetration experiment to quantify the cohesive force effect.

Recently, this\napproach has been generalized in \\cite{LHN} by arranging individuals on the\nnodes of a network. Undirected networks seem to have a smoother behavior than\ndirected ones, and thus it is more challenging to find suppressors/amplifiers\nof selection. In this paper we present the first class of undirected graphs\nwhich act as suppressors of selection, by achieving a fixation probability that\nis at most one half of that of the complete graph, as the number of vertices\nincreases. Moreover, we provide some generic upper and lower bounds for the\nfixation probability of general undirected graphs. As our main contribution, we\nintroduce the natural alternative of the model proposed in \\cite{LHN}, where\nall individuals interact simultaneously and the result is a compromise between\naggressive and non-aggressive individuals. That is, the behavior of the\nindividuals in our new model and in the model of \\cite{LHN} can be interpreted\nas an \"aggregation\" vs. an \"all-or-nothing\" strategy, respectively. We prove\nthat our new model of mutual influences admits a \\emph{potential function},\nwhich guarantees the convergence of the system for any graph topology and any\ninitial fitness vector of the individuals. Furthermore, we prove fast\nconvergence to the stable state for the case of the complete graph, as well as\nwe provide almost tight bounds on the limit fitness of the individuals. Apart\nfrom being important on its own, this new evolutionary model appears to be\nuseful also in the abstract modeling of control mechanisms over invading\npopulations in networks. We demonstrate this by introducing and analyzing two\nalternative control approaches, for which we bound the time needed to stabilize\nto the \"healthy\" state of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 20:54:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 19:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 17:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}

We show that\nproperties of dark matter subhaloes can be inferred from the profile and\namplitude of the modal energy of the disc.

To construct our non-interactive quantum\nbit commitment scheme from any quantum one-way function, we follow the\nprocedure below: (i) from Dumais-Mayers-Salvail scheme to a weakly-hiding and\n1-out-of-2 binding commitment (of a parallel variant); (ii) from the\nweakly-hiding and 1-out-of-2 binding commitment to a strongly-hiding and\n1-out-of-2 binding commitment; (iii) from the strongly-hiding and 1-out-of-2\nbinding commitment to a normal statistically-hiding commitment.

A\ncouple of decades ago, it was observed experimentally that the penetration\ndepth versus time curve (say $s(t)$ vs. $t$) behaves like $s(t)=C\\sqrt{t}$ for\nsufficiently large times $t > 0$ (with $C$ a positive constant). Consequently,\nmany fitting arguments solely based on this experimental law were used to\npredict the large-time behavior of carbonation fronts in real structures, a\ntheoretical justification of the $\\sqrt{t}$-law being lacking until now. %This\nis the place where our paper contributes:\n  The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by justifying rigorously the\nexperimentally guessed asymptotic behavior. We have previously proven the upper\nbound $s(t)\\leq C'\\sqrt{t}$ for some constant $C'$; now we show the optimality\nof the rate by proving the right nontrivial lower estimate, i.e. there exists\n$C\">0$ such that $s(t)\\geq C\"\\sqrt{t}$. Additionally, we obtain weak solutions\nto the free-boundary problem for the case when the measure of the initial\ndomain vanishes. In this way, our mathematical model is now allowing for the\nappearance of a moving carbonation front -- a scenario that until was hard to\nhandle from the analysis point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 23:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-18"}

We assume that the process of rewiring\nand node state change occur with probabilities Pr and Pc respectively,\nindependent of each other. The collective behavior of a coevolutionary system\ncan be characterized on the space of parameters (Pr, Pc). As an application,\nfor a voterlike node dynamics we find that reconnections between nodes with\nsimilar states lead to network fragmentation.

With this decomposition we show\nthat the Einstein's theory can be decomposed into the restricted part made of\nthe restricted connection which has the full Lorentz gauge invariance and the\nvalence part made of the valence connection which plays the role of\ngravitational source of the restricted gravity. We show that there are two\ndifferent Abelian decomposition of Einstein's theory, the light-like (or null)\ndecomposition and the non light-like (or non-null) decomposition, because\nLorentz group has two maximal Abelian subgroups. In this decomposition the role\nof the metric $g_\\mn$ is replaced by a four-index metric tensor $\\vg_\\mn$ which\ntransforms covariantly under the Lorentz group, and the metric-compatibility\ncondition $\\nabla_\\alpha g_\\mn=0$ of the connection is replaced by the gauge\nand generally covariant condition ${\\mathscr D}_\\mu \\vg^\\mn=0$.

The main result of this\npaper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about three\ntimes the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. The probability that\nthe variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.\nAs a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the same\nlocation in stars with metallicity higher than the stream, [Fe/H]=[0, -0.5] and\nfind no variations above the expected shot noise.

The\ninfluence of weak electric field on the process in a magnetic field is\nconsidered. In particular, in the presence of electric field the root\ndivergence in the probability of pair creation on the Landau energy levels is\nvanished. For smaller photon energies the low energy approximation is used. The\nfound probability describes the absorption of soft photon by particles created\nby field. At low photon energy the electric field action dominates and the\ninfluence of magnetic field on the process is connected with the interaction of\nit and the magnetic moment of creating particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 07:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

During gravitational\ncollapse, such magnetic fields can be amplified by compression and by\nturbulence, giving rise to the small-scale dynamo. On scales below the Jeans\nlength, the eddy turnover timescale is much shorter than the free-fall\ntimescale, so that saturation can be reached during collapse.

In PNC, in contrast\nto the classical memoryless setting, nodes store received information in memory\nto later produce coded packets that reflect this information. PNC is known to\nachieve order optimal stopping times for the many-to-all multicast problem in\nmany settings.\n  We give a reduction that captures exactly how PNC and other network coding\nprotocols use the memory of the nodes. More precisely, we show that any such\nprotocol implementation induces a transformation which maps an execution of the\nprotocol to an instance of the classical memoryless setting. This allows us to\nprove that, for any (non-adaptive dynamic) network, PNC converges with high\nprobability in optimal time. In other words, it stops at exactly the first time\nin which in hindsight it was possible to route information from the sources to\neach receiver individually.\n  Our technique also applies to variants of PNC, in which each node uses only a\nfinite buffer. We show that, even in this setting, PNC stops exactly within the\ntime in which in hindsight it was possible to route packets given the memory\nconstraint, i.e., that the memory used at each node never exceeds its buffer\nsize. This shows that PNC, even without any feedback or explicit memory\nmanagement, allows to keep minimal buffer sizes while maintaining its capacity\nachieving performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 12:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-18"}

A frequency analysis of the eclipse-subtracted light curve reveals\nat least 68 frequencies of which 55 or more can be attributed to pulsation\nmodes. The main limitation on this analysis is the frequency resolution within\nthe 27-day short-cadence light curve. Most of the variability signal lies in\nthe frequency range 18 to 31 c/d, with amplitudes between 0.1 and 4 mmag. One\nharmonic term (2.f) and a few combination frequencies (f_i+f_j) have been\ndetected. From a plot of the residuals versus orbital phase we assign the\npulsations to the primary star in the system. The pulsations were removed from\nthe short-cadence data and the light curve was modelled using the\nWilson-Devinney code. We are unable to get a perfect fit due to the residual\neffects of pulsations and also to the treatment of reflection and reprocessing\nin the light curve model.

This scenario includes the three pairs fairness\nproblem, and allows to study some fairness issues of the IEEE 802.11 medium\naccess mechanism. We show by simulation that interesting phenomena appear,\ndepending on the number n of pairs in the chain and of its parity. We also\npoint out a notable asymptotic behavior. We introduce a powerful modeling, by\nsimply considering the probability for a transmitter to send data while its\nneighbors are waiting. This model leads to a non-linear system of equations,\nwhich matches very well the simulations, and which allows to study both small\nand very large chains. We then analyze the fairness issue in the chain\nregarding some parameters, as well as the asymptotic behavior.

As an application, we show how to increase the fairness in a\nchain of three pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 15:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-18"}

In this paper\nwe identify and characterize a phenomenon that has not been previously\nobserved: homogeneous peers (with respect to their upload capacities)\nexperience heterogeneous download rates. The consequences of this phenomenon\nhave direct impact on peer and system performance, such as high variability of\ndownload times, unfairness with respect to peer arrival order, bursty\ndepartures and content synchronization. Detailed packet-level simulations and\nprototype-based experiments on the Internet were performed to characterize this\nphenomenon. We also develop a mathematical model that accurately predicts the\nheterogeneous download rates of the homogeneous peers as a function of their\ncontent. Although this phenomenon is more prevalent in unpopular swarms (very\nfew peers), these by far represent the most common type of swarm in BT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 15:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 15:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-21"}

There are various theoretical approaches to\nsuch a quantum-gravity theory. Nevertheless, experimental progress is hampered\nin this research field because many models predict deviations from established\nphysics that are suppressed by some power of the Planck scale, which currently\nappears to be immeasurably small. However, tests of relativity theory provide\none promising avenue to overcome this phenomenological obstacle: many models\nfor underlying physics can accommodate a small breakdown of Lorentz symmetry,\nand numerous feasible Lorentz-symmetry tests have Planck reach. Such mild\nviolations of Einstein's relativity have therefore become a focus of recent\nresearch efforts. This presentation provides a brief survey of the key ideas in\nthis research field and is geared at both experimentalists and theorists. In\nparticular, several theoretical mechanisms leading to deviations from\nrelativity theory are presented; the standard theoretical framework for\nrelativity violations at currently accessible energy scales (i.e., the SME) is\nreviewed, and various present and near-future experimental efforts within this\nfield are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 15:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}
