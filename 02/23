A\ndomain-specific language (DSL) is a programming language dedicated to a\nparticular problem domain that offers specific notations and abstractions that\nincrease programmer productivity within that domain. Models offer a high-level\nway for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at the right\nlevel of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for\nprogramming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a\nseparate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a\nholistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,\nuncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional\ngeneral-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language\nfeatures and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,\nsystematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and\nprecisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the\nrobotics domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 17:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-23"}

With a total exposure time of 1.4 Ms, ChASeM33 covers ~70% of\nthe D25 isophote (R\\approx4kpc) of M33 and provides the deepest, most complete,\nand detailed look at a spiral galaxy in X-rays. The source catalog includes 662\nsources, reaches a limiting unabsorbed luminosity of ~2.4x10^(34) erg/s in the\n0.35-8.0keV energy band, and contains source positions, source net counts,\nfluxes and significances in several energy bands, and information on source\nvariability. The analysis challenges posed by ChASeM33 and the techniques\nadopted to address these challenges are discussed. To constrain the nature of\nthe detected X-ray source, hardness ratios were constructed and spectra were\nfit for 254 sources, followup MMT spectra of 116 sources were acquired, and\ncross-correlations with previous X-ray catalogs and other multi-wavelength data\nwere generated. Based on this effort, 183 of the 662 ChASeM33 sources could be\nidentified. Finally, the luminosity function for the detected point sources as\nwell as the one for the X-ray binaries in M33 is presented. The luminosity\nfunctions in the soft band (0.5-2.0 keV) and the hard band (2.0-8.0 keV) have a\nlimiting luminosity at the 90% completeness limit of 4.0x10^(34) erg/s and\n1.6x10^(35) erg/s (for D=817kpc), respectively, which is significantly lower\nthan what was reported by previous X-ray binary population studies in galaxies\nmore distant than M33. The resulting distribution is consistent with a dominant\npopulation of high mass X-ray binaries as would be expected for M33.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 17:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

While network reciprocity promotes collaborative\nefforts, chances of averting the impending social decline are slim if the\ntemptation to defect is strong. It is therefore of interest to identify viable\nmechanisms that provide additional support for the evolution of cooperation.\nInspired by the fact that the environment may be just as important as\ninheritance for individual development, we introduce a simple switch that\nallows a player to either keep its original payoff or use the average payoff of\nall its neighbors. Depending on which payoff is higher, the influence of either\noption can be tuned by means of a single parameter. We show that, in general,\ntaking into account the environment promotes cooperation. Yet coveting the\nfitness of one's neighbors too strongly is not optimal. In fact, cooperation\nthrives best only if the influence of payoffs obtained in the traditional way\nis equal to that of the average payoff of the neighborhood. We present results\nfor the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game, for different levels of\nuncertainty governing the strategy adoption process, and for different\nneighborhood sizes.

During the hydrodynamic stage,\nthe production of lepton pairs is described by radiation rates for a strongly\ninteracting medium in thermal equilibrium. In the low mass region, hadronic\nthermal emission is evaluated assuming vector meson dominance including\nin-medium modifications of the rho meson spectral function through scattering\nfrom nucleons and pions in the heat bath. In the intermediate mass region, the\nhadronic rate is essentially determined by multi-pion annihilation processes.\nEmission from quark-antiquark annihilation in the quark gluon plasma is taken\ninto account as well. When the system is sufficiently dilute, the hydrodynamic\ndescription breaks down and a transition to a final cascade stage is performed.\nIn this stage dimuon emission is evaluated as commonly done in transport\nmodels. Focusing on the enhancement with respect to the contribution from\nlong-lived hadron decays after freezout observed at the SPS in the low mass\nregion of the dilepton spectra, the relative importance of the different\nthermal contributions and of the two dynamical stages is investigated.

Such variability in protein\nlevels can arise from infrequent synthesis of mRNAs which in turn give rise to\nbursts of protein expression. Protein expression occurring in bursts has indeed\nbeen observed experimentally and recent studies have also found evidence for\ntranscriptional bursting, i.e. production of mRNAs in bursts. Given that there\nare distinct experimental techniques for quantifying the noise at different\nstages of gene expression, it is of interest to derive analytical results\nconnecting experimental observations at different levels. In this work, we\nconsider stochastic models of gene expression for which mRNA and protein\nproduction occurs in independent bursts. For such models, we derive analytical\nexpressions connecting protein and mRNA burst distributions which show how the\nfunctional form of the mRNA burst distribution can be inferred from the protein\nburst distribution. Additionally, if gene expression is repressed such that\nobserved protein bursts arise only from single mRNAs, we show how observations\nof protein burst distributions (repressed and unrepressed) can be used to\ncompletely determine the mRNA burst distribution. Assuming independent\ncontributions from individual bursts, we derive analytical expressions\nconnecting means and variances for burst and steady-state protein\ndistributions. Finally, we validate our general analytical results by\nconsidering a specific reaction scheme involving regulation of protein bursts\nby small RNAs. For a range of parameters, we derive analytical expressions for\nregulated protein distributions that are validated using stochastic\nsimulations. The analytical results obtained in this work can thus serve as\nuseful inputs for a broad range of studies focusing on stochasticity in gene\nexpression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 18:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Its main advantage over random walks and other\nexploration techniques is that a BFS sample is a plausible graph on its own,\nand therefore we can study its topological characteristics. However, it has\nbeen empirically observed that incomplete BFS is biased toward high-degree\nnodes, which may strongly affect the measurements. In this paper, we first\nanalytically quantify the degree bias of BFS sampling. In particular, we\ncalculate the node degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a\nfunction of the fraction f of covered nodes, in a random graph RG(pk) with an\narbitrary degree distribution pk. We also show that, for RG(pk), all commonly\nused graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, Forest Fire, Snowball Sampling, RDS)\nsuffer from exactly the same bias. Next, based on our theoretical analysis, we\npropose a practical BFS-bias correction procedure. It takes as input a\ncollected BFS sample together with its fraction f. Even though RG(pk) does not\ncapture many graph properties common in real-life graphs (such as\nassortativity), our RG(pk)-based correction technique performs well on a broad\nrange of Internet topologies and on two large BFS samples of Facebook and Orkut\nnetworks. Finally, we consider and evaluate a family of alternative correction\nprocedures, and demonstrate that, although they are unbiased for an arbitrary\ntopology, their large variance makes them far less effective than the\nRG(pk)-based technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 20:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-23"}

This can be crucial to a proper interpretation of\nanalysis results because instrumental calibration uncertainty is a form of\nsystematic uncertainty. Ignoring it can underestimate error bars and introduce\nbias into the fitted values of model parameters. Accounting for such\nuncertainties currently requires extensive case-specific simulations if using\nexisting analysis packages. Here we present general statistical methods that\nincorporate calibration uncertainties into spectral analysis of high-energy\ndata. We first present a method based on multiple imputation that can be\napplied with any fitting method, but is necessarily approximate. We then\ndescribe a more exact Bayesian approach that works in conjunction with a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo based fitting. We explore methods for improving computational\nefficiency, and in particular detail a method of summarizing calibration\nuncertainties with a principal component analysis of samples of plausible\ncalibration files. This method is implemented using recently codified Chandra\neffective area uncertainties for low-resolution spectral analysis and is\nverified using both simulated and actual Chandra data. Our procedure for\nincorporating effective area uncertainty is easily generalized to other types\nof calibration uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 20:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}

We find that the stellar\nmass BHs segregate rapidly into the cluster core to form a central dense\nsub-cluster of BHs in which BH-BH binaries form via 3-body encounters. While\nmost of the BH binaries finally escape from the cluster by recoils due to\nsuper-elastic encounters with the single BHs, we find that for clusters with\nN(0) >= 5 X 10^4, typically a few of them dynamically harden to the extent that\nthey can merge via GW emission within the cluster.

Starting from the assumption that\nnon-spherical PN cannot be formed by single stars, he linked PN morphologies to\nthe binary mechanisms that may have formed them, basing these connections\nalmost entirely on observational arguments. In light of the last decade of\ndiscovery in the field of PN, we revise this framework, which, although\nsimplistic, can still serve as a benchmark against which to test theories of PN\norigin and shaping. Within the framework, we revisit the role of planets in\nshaping PN. Soker invoked a planetary role in shaping PN because there are not\nenough close binaries to shape the large fraction of non-spherical PN. In this\npaper we adopt a model whereby only ~20% of all 1-8 solar mass stars make a PN.\nThis reduces the need for planetary shaping. Through a propagation of\npercentages argument, and starting from the assumption that planets can only\nshape mildly elliptical PN, we conclude, like in Soker, that ~20% of all PN\nwere shaped via planetary and other substellar interactions but we add that\nthis corresponds to only ~5% of all 1-8 solar mass stars. This may be in line\nwith findings of planets around main sequence stars. PN shaping by planets is\nmade plausible by the recent discovery of planets that have survived\ninteractions with red giant branch (RGB) stars. Finally, we conclude that of\nthe ~80% of 1-8 solar mass stars that do not make a PN, about one quarter do\nnot even ascend the AGB due to interactions with stellar and substellar\ncompanions, while three quarters ascend the AGB but do not make a PN. Once\nthese stars leave the AGB they evolve normally and can be confused with\npost-RGB, extreme horizontal branch stars. We propose tests to identify them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 02:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Traditionally, they have been\nregarded as identical (equivalent, in fact, for pure two qubit states, that is,\n{\\it Gisin's Theorem}), yet they constitute different resources. Describing\nnonlocality by means of the violation of several Bell inequalities, we obtain\nby direct optimization those states of two qubits that maximally violate a Bell\ninequality, in terms of their degree of mixture as measured by either their\nparticipation ratio $R=1/Tr(\\rho^2)$ or their maximum eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_{max}$. This optimum value is obtained as well, which coincides with\nprevious results. Comparison with entanglement is performed too. An example of\nan application is given in the XY model. In this novel approximation, we also\nconcentrate on the nonlocality for linear combinations of pure states of two\nqubits, providing a closed form for their maximal nonlocality measure. The case\nof Bell diagonal mixed states of two qubits is also extensively studied.\nSpecial attention concerning the connection between nonlocality and\nentanglement for mixed states of two qubits is paid to the so called maximally\nentangled mixed states. Additional aspects for the case of two qubits are also\ndescribed in detail. Since we deal with qubit systems, we will perform an\nanalogous study for three qubits, employing similar tools. Relation between\ndistillability and nonlocality is explored quantitatively for the whole space\nof states of three qubits. We finally extend our analysis to four qubit\nsystems, where nonlocality for generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states\nof arbitrary number of parties is computed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 02:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We also relate Jones' basic construction to the\nStinespring dilation associated to the conditional expectation onto a\nfinite-index inclusion (by invoking the uniqueness assertion regarding the\nlatter).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 05:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-25"}

Based on\nour model predictions we conclude that for polymeric particles the surface\npressure cannot be modelled directly by inert particles that interact via some\neffective potential. Internal degrees of freedom within gel particles are\nall-important. Consequently, the surface pressure of a fully packed layer is\nnot proportional to kT/d^2, where d is the particle diameter; but proportional\nto kT/dm^2, where dm is the size of the molecular units that make up the\nparticle. This increases the surface pressure and modulus by some four orders\nof magnitude. For short range interaction we study the dynamic behaviour, and\nfind fractal-like structures at low concentrations. At intermediate coverage an\nirregular structure is formed that resembles a spinodal system. This system\nfreezes, which arrests the spinodal structure. At high surface coverage the\nsimulations show poly-crystalline domains. For dilute systems, the strength of\nthe surface layers is determined by simulated compression and expansion.

Previous computations of photon emission have been\ncarried out using a hydrodynamical medium description with smooth, averaged\ninitial conditions. Recently, more sophisticated hydrodynamical models which\ncalculate observables by averaging over many evolutions with event-by-event\nfluctuating initial conditions (IC) have been developed. Given their direct\nconnection to the early time dynamics, thermal photon emission appears an ideal\nobservable to probe fluctuations in the medium initial state. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that including fluctuations in the IC may lead to an enhancement of\nthe thermal photon yield of about a factor of 2 in the region $2 < p_T < 4$\nGeV/$c$ (where thermal photon production dominates the direct photon yield)\ncompared to a scenario using smooth, averaged IC. Consequently, a much better\nagreement with PHENIX data is found. This can be understood in terms of the\nstrong temperature dependence of thermal photon production, translating into a\nsensitivity to the presence of 'hotspots' in an event and thus establishing\nthermal photons as a suitable probe to characterize IC fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 10:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 13:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

Here we\naddress issues specific to the perception of categories (e.g. vowels, familiar\nfaces, ...), making a clear distinction between identifying a category (an\nelement of a discrete set) and estimating a continuous parameter (such as a\ndirection). We exhibit a link between optimal Bayesian decoding and coding\nefficiency, the latter being measured by the mutual information between the\ndiscrete category set and the neural activity. We characterize the properties\nof the best estimator of the likelihood of the category, when this estimator\ntakes its inputs from a large population of stimulus-specific coding cells.\nAdopting the diffusion-to-bound approach to model the decisional process, this\nallows to relate analytically the bias and variance of the diffusion process\nunderlying decision making to macroscopic quantities that are behaviorally\nmeasurable. A major consequence is the existence of a quantitative link between\nreaction times and discrimination accuracy. The resulting analytical expression\nof mean reaction times during an identification task accounts for empirical\nfacts, both qualitatively (e.g. more time is needed to identify a category from\na stimulus at the boundary compared to a stimulus lying within a category), and\nquantitatively (working on published experimental data on phoneme\nidentification tasks).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 14:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-01"}

Evidence for this\nunderstanding is that the terrestrial climate correlates positively with solar\nactivity. During the past 10,000 years, the Sun has experienced substantial\nvariations in activity and there have been numerous attempts to reconstruct\nsolar irradiance. While there is general agreement on how solar forcing varied\nduring the last several hundred years --- all reconstructions are proportional\nto the solar activity --- there is scientific controversy on the magnitude of\nsolar forcing. We present a reconstruction of the Total and Spectral Solar\nIrradiance covering 130 nm--10 $\\mu$m from 1610 to the present with annual\nresolution and for the Holocene with 22-year resolution. We assume that the\nminimum state of the quiet Sun in time corresponds to the observed quietest\narea on the present Sun. Then we use available long-term proxies of the solar\nactivity, which are $^{10}$Be isotope concentrations in ice cores and 22-year\nsmoothed neutron monitor data, to interpolate between the present quiet Sun and\nthe minimum state of the quiet Sun. This determines the long-term trend in the\nsolar variability which is then superposed with the 11-year activity cycle\ncalculated from the sunspot number. The time-dependent solar spectral\nirradiance from about 7000 BC to the present is then derived using a\nstate-of-the-art radiation code. We derive a total and spectral solar\nirradiance that was substantially lower during the Maunder minimum than\nobserved today. The difference is remarkably larger than other estimations\npublished in the recent literature. The magnitude of the solar UV variability,\nwhich indirectly affects climate is also found to exceed previous estimates. We\ndiscuss in details the assumptions which leaded us to this conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 15:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

But the\nempirical databases for quantitative calibration are still insufficient, e.g.\nthe fundamental diagram as one of the most important relationships displays\nnon-negligible differences among various studies. To improve this situation,\nexperiments in straight corridors and T-junction are performed. Four different\nmeasurement methods are defined to study their effects on the fundamental\ndiagram. It is shown that they have minor influences for {\\rho} <3.5 m-2 but\nonly the Voronoi method is able to resolve the fine-structure of the\nfundamental diagram. This enhanced measurement method permits to observe the\noccurrence of boundary-induced phase transition. For corridors of different\nwidths we found that the specific flow concept works well for {\\rho} <3.5 m-2.\nMoreover, we illustrate the discrepancies between the fundamental diagrams of a\nT-junction and a straight corridor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 15:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 17:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}
