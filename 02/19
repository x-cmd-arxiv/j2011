In this setting, players occupy the vertices\nof a graph and play the game only with their immediate neighbours. Various\nevolutionary dynamics have been studied in this setting for different games.\nDue to the complexity of the analysis, however, most of the work in this area\nis experimental. This paper aims to contribute to a more complete\nunderstanding, by providing rigorous analysis. We study the imitation dynamics\non two classes of graph: cycles and complete graphs. We focus on three well\nknown social dilemmas, namely the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Stag Hunt and the\nSnowdrift Game. We also consider, for completeness, the so-called Harmony Game.\nOur analysis shows that, on the cycle, all four games converge fast, either to\ntotal cooperation or total defection. On the complete graph, all but the\nSnowdrift game converge fast, either to cooperation or defection. The Snowdrift\ngame reaches a metastable state fast, where cooperators and defectors coexist.\nIt will converge to cooperation or defection only after spending time in this\nstate which is exponential in the size, n, of the graph.

The fast forward shock\nof the supernova remnant (SNR) can accelerate particles by diffusive shock\nacceleration (DSA) in a cavern blown by a strong, pre-supernova stellar wind.\nAs a fundamental part of nonlinear DSA, some fraction of the accelerated\nparticles escape the shock and interact with a surrounding massive dense shell\nproducing hard photon emission. To calculate this emission, we have developed a\nnew Monte Carlo technique for propagating the cosmic rays (CRs) produced by the\nforward shock of the SNR, into the dense, external material. This technique is\nincorporated in a hydrodynamic model of an evolving SNR which includes the\nnonlinear feedback of CRs on the SNR evolution, the production of escaping CRs\nalong with those that remain trapped within the remnant, and the broad-band\nemission of radiation from trapped and escaping CRs. While our combined\nCR-hydro-escape model is quite general and applies to both core collapse and\nthermonuclear supernovae, the parameters we choose for our discussion here are\nmore typical of SNRs from very massive stars whose emission spectra differ\nsomewhat from those produced by lower mass progenitors directly interacting\nwith a molecular cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 18:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

First, we show that if the intracluster\nsimilarities exceed intercluster similarities, then it is possible to correctly\ndetermine the hierarchical clustering from as few as 3N log N similarities. We\ndemonstrate this order of magnitude savings in the number of pairwise\nsimilarities necessitates sequentially selecting which similarities to obtain\nin an adaptive fashion, rather than picking them at random.

An efficient algorithm coupling ridge regression with label\npropagation, and two variants are introduced to find the optimal solution of\nthe framework.

Using the\n3D SPH code GADGET-3, we perform simulations of gas accretion onto a central\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass 10^8 M_sun within the radial range of\n0.1 - 200 pc. We carry out simulations without and with radiative heating by a\ncentral X-ray corona and radiative cooling. For an adiabatic case, the radial\nprofiles of hydrodynamical properties match the Bondi solution, except near the\ninner and outer radius of the computational domain. We find that adiabatic\nBondi accretion can be reproduced for durations of a few dynamical times at the\nBondi radius, and for longer times if the outer radius is increased. With\nradiative heating and cooling included, the spherically accreting gas takes a\nlonger time to reach a steady-state than the adiabatic Bondi accretion runs,\nand in some cases does not reach a steady-state even within several hundred\ndynamical times. We find that artificial viscosity in the GADGET code causes\nexcessive heating near the inner radius, making the thermal properties of the\ngas inconsistent with a physical solution. This overheating occurs typically\nonly in the supersonic part of the flow, so that it does not affect the mass\naccretion rate. We see that increasing the X-ray luminosity produces a lower\ncentral mass inflow rate, implying that feedback due to radiative heating is\noperational in our simulations. With a sufficiently high X-ray luminosity, the\ninflowing gas is radiatively heated up, and an outflow develops. We conclude\nthat the SPH simulations can capture the gas dynamics needed to study radiative\nfeedback provided artificial viscosity alters only highly supersonic part of\nthe inflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 21:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 04:15:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 23:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-13"}

The mass of the planet,\nknown as Gl 581g, has been estimated to be between 3.1 and 4.3 Earth masses. In\nthis study, we investigate the habitability of Gl 581g based on a previously\nused concept that explores its long-term possibility of photosynthetic biomass\nproduction, which has already been used to gauge the principal possibility of\nlife regarding the super-Earths Gl 581c and Gl 581d. Methods: A thermal\nevolution model for super-Earths is used to calculate the sources and sinks of\natmospheric carbon dioxide. The habitable zone is determined by the limits of\nphotosynthetic biological productivity on the planetary surface. Models with\ndifferent ratios of land / ocean coverage are pursued. Results: The maximum\ntime span for habitable conditions is attained for water worlds at a position\nof about 0.14+/-0.015 AU, which deviates by just a few percent (depending on\nthe adopted stellar luminosity) from the actual position of Gl 581g, an\nestimate that does however not reflect systematic uncertainties inherent in our\nmodel. Therefore, in the framework of our model an almost perfect Goldilock\nposition is realized. The existence of habitability is found to critically\ndepend on the relative planetary continental area, lending a considerable\nadvantage to the possibility of life if Gl 581g's ocean coverage is relatively\nhigh.

In stark contrast to transport\nexperiments, absorption of a single photon leads to an abrupt change in the\nsystem Hamiltonian and a quantum quench of Kondo correlations. By inferring the\ncharacteristic power law exponents from the experimental absorption\nline-shapes, we find a unique signature of the quench in the form of an\nAnderson orthogonality catastrophe, originating from a vanishing overlap\nbetween the initial and final many-body wave-functions.

We find that the tuning fork resonator\nquality factor changes even for the case of a purely elastic sensor-sample\ninteraction. This is due to the effective mechanical imbalance of the tuning\nfork prongs induced by the sensor-sample force gradient which in turn has an\nimpact on the dissipation through the attachment of the resonator base. This\neffect may yield a measured dissipation signal that can be different to the one\nexclusively related to the dissipation between the sensor and the sample. We\nalso find that there is a second order term in addition to the linear\nrelationship between the sensor-sample force gradient and the resonance\nfrequency shift of the tuning fork that is significant even for force gradients\nusually present in atomic force microscopy which are in the range of tens of\nN/m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 16:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-22"}
