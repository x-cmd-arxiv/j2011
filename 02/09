In this theory\nthe motion of an electron is considered to occur along a trajectory the\npresence of which is a reflection of the existence of a particle, as well as it\nis assumed that any motion is defined by a wave V(x,t). It is assumed that\nthere is an explicit relationship between the trajectory and wave equations of\nthe electron, which are established on the basis of the local variational\nprinciple. In this approach, an electron wave propagating in free space takes\nalong the electron trajectory. We used this theory to describe the electron\nmotion in a hydrogen-like atom and found its stationary states. The energies of\nthese states coincide with the known quantum mechanics solutions for the\nstationary energies of the hydrogen-like atom, however, in our approach the\nspatial trajectories of the electron have the form of the surfaces, which are\nformed in the region of nodes of the standing electron wave. These surfaces\nhave the form of spheres for the spherical symmetrical electron states and the\nradii of these spheres coincide with the radii of the Bohr orbits of these\nstates. Thus, in this approach the trajectory and wave measurements of the\nelectron get a consistent spatial description that is inherent to the picture\nof the corpuscular-wave monism. We discuss the considerable correspondence of\nthe proposed theory with the quantum mechanics results describing the\nstationary and non-stationary motions of the electron in the atom and their\ndifference. We believe that measuring of the spatial configuration of the\nobserved electron trajectory surfaces in an atom could be a deep examination of\nthe standard quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 16:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-09"}

If this deconfinement phase\ntransition is of the first order then it will be triggered by the nucleation of\na critical size drop of the stable quark phase in the metastable hadronic\nphase. Within these circumstances it has been shown that cold pure hadronic\ncompact stars above a threshold value of their gravitational mass are\nmetastable with respect to the \"decay\" to quark stars (compact stars made at\nleast in part of quark matter). This stellar conversion process liberates a\nhuge amount of energy, and it could be the energy source of some of the long\nGRBs. The main goal of the present work is to establish whether a newborn\nhadronic star (proto-hadronic star) could survive the early stages of its\nevolution without \"decaying\" to a quark star. To this aim, we study the\nnucleation process of quark matter in hot beta-stable hadronic matter, with and\nwithout trapped neutrinos. We calculate and compare the nucleation rate and the\nnucleation time due to thermal and quantum nucleation mechanisms. We compute\nthe crossover temperature above which thermal nucleation dominates the finite\ntemperature quantum nucleation mechanism. We next discuss the consequences of\nquark matter nucleation for the physics and the evolution of proto-neutron\nstars.

Quantum information allows for bit commitment schemes in the\ninformation theoretic setting where no dishonest party can perfectly cheat. The\npreviously best-known quantum protocol by Ambainis achieved a cheating\nprobability of at most 3/4[Amb01]. On the other hand, Kitaev showed that no\nquantum protocol can have cheating probability less than 1/sqrt{2} [Kit03] (his\nlower bound on coin flipping can be easily extended to bit commitment). Closing\nthis gap has since been an important and open question.\n  In this paper, we provide the optimal bound for quantum bit commitment. We\nfirst show a lower bound of approximately 0.739, improving Kitaev's lower\nbound. We then present an optimal quantum bit commitment protocol which has\ncheating probability arbitrarily close to 0.739. More precisely, we show how to\nuse any weak coin flipping protocol with cheating probability 1/2 + eps in\norder to achieve a quantum bit commitment protocol with cheating probability\n0.739 + O(eps). We then use the optimal quantum weak coin flipping protocol\ndescribed by Mochon[Moc07]. To stress the fact that our protocol uses quantum\neffects beyond the weak coin flip, we show that any classical bit commitment\nprotocol with access to perfect weak (or strong) coin flipping has cheating\nprobability at least 3/4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 18:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-09"}

We search for binaries of period P<200 days among a\nsample of blue horizontal branch stars (Teff=12000-22000 K) in NGC2808, a\ncluster known to host three distinct stellar populations and a multimodal\nhorizontal branch. The final sample consists of 64 targets. The radial velocity\nof the targets was measured in fourteen epochs, spanning a temporal interval of\nabout 75 days. We detect no RV variable object among stars cooler than the\nphotometric G1 gap at 17000 K, while two close (P<10 days) and two\nintermediate-period (P=10-50 days) systems are found among hotter targets. The\nclose and intermediate-period binary fraction for stars cooler than the gap are\nfc<5% and fip<10%, respectively, with 95% confidence. The most probable values\namong hotter stars are fc~20% and fip~30%, but the 90%- confidence level\nintervals are large (6-42% and 11-72%, respectively). The G1 gap appears as a\ndiscontinuity in the binary faction, with a higher incidence of binaries among\nhotter stars, but a constant increase in f with temperature rather than a\ndiscontinuity cannot be excluded from our observations. We find that\nintermediate-period binaries, never investigated before among cluster HB stars,\ncould play an important role, being more than ~15-20% of the hottest stars of\nour sample. Our results indicate that fc among hot HB stars is most probably\nhigher for younger clusters, confirming the recently proposed age-fc relation.\nHowever, the large observed difference in binary fraction between clusters\n(e.g. NGC2808 and NGC6752) is still not reproduced by binary population\nsynthesis models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 19:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Deep JHKs\ncolour-colour and ZAMS relations derived from ~700 unreddened stars featuring\n2MASS photometry and precise HIP parallaxes (d<~25 pc) are applied to establish\ndistances to several benchmark open clusters that host delta Scutis: Hyades,\nPleiades, Praesepe, alpha Per, and M67 (d=47+-2,138+-6,183+-8,171+-8,815+-40\npc). That analysis provided constraints on the delta Sct sample's absolute\nWesenheit magnitudes (W_VI,0), evolutionary status, and pulsation modes (order,\nn). The reliability of JHKs established cluster parameters is demonstrated via\na comparison with van Leeuwen 2009 revised HIP results.

Spectroscopic observations revealed\nthat this is a binary star with a highly eccentric orbit, e=0.83. We are able\nto match the Kepler light curve and radial velocities with a nearly face-on\n(i=5.5 degree) binary star model in which the brightening events are caused by\ntidal distortion and irradiation of nearly identical A stars during their close\nperiastron passage. The two dominant oscillations in the light curve,\nresponsible for the beating pattern, have frequencies that are the 91st and\n90th harmonic of the orbital frequency. The power spectrum of the light curve,\nafter removing the binary star brightening component, reveals a large number of\npulsations, 30 of which have a signal-to-noise ratio > 7. Nearly all of these\npulsations have frequencies that are either integer multiples of the orbital\nfrequency or are tidally-split multiples of the orbital frequency. This pattern\nof frequencies unambiguously establishes the pulsations as resonances between\nthe dynamic tides at periastron and the free oscillation modes of one of the\nstars. KOI-54 is only the 4th star to show such a phenomenon, and is by far the\nrichest in terms of excited modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 21:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 23:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The broken-symmetry states that dominate\nin the weakly frustrated region near the rectangular lattice limit are the well\nknown antiferromagnetic state with in-phase lattice dimerization along one\ndirection, and the Wigner crystal state with the checkerboard charge order. For\nmoderate to strong frustration, however, the dominant phase is a novel\nspin-singlet paired-electron crystal (PEC), consisting of pairs of charge-rich\nsites separated by pairs of charge-poor sites. The PEC, with coexisting\ncharge-order and spin-gap in two dimension, is the quarter-filled band\nequivalent of the valence bond solid (VBS) that can appear in the frustrated\nhalf-filled band within antiferromagnetic spin Hamiltonians. We discuss the\nphase diagram as a function of on-site and intersite Coulomb interactions as\nwell as electron-phonon coupling strength. We speculate that the spin-bonded\npairs of the PEC can become mobile for even stronger frustration, giving rise\nto a paired-electron liquid. We discuss the implications of the PEC concept for\nunderstanding several classes of quarter-filled band materials that display\nunconventional superconductivity, focusing in particular on organic charge\ntransfer solids.

The database was used to study the\nglitch activity among the pulsar population, finding that it peaks for pulsars\nwith a characteristic age tau_c ~ 10kyr and decreases for longer values of\ntau_c, disappearing for objects with tau_c > 20Myr. The glitch activity is also\nsmaller in the very young pulsars (tau_c <~ 1kyr). The cumulative effect of\nglitches, a collection of instantaneous spin up events, acts to reduce the\nregular long term spindown rate |nudot| of the star. The percentage of |nudot|\nreversed by glitch activity was found to vary between 0.5% and 1.6% for pulsars\nwith spindown rates |nudot| between 10^(-14) and 3.2*10^(-11) Hz/s, decreasing\nto less than 0.01% at both higher and lower spindown rates. These ratios are\ninterpreted in terms of the amount of superfluid involved in the generation of\nglitches. In this context the activity of the youngest pulsar studied, the Crab\npulsar, may be explained by quake-like activity within the crust. Pulsars with\nlow spindown rates seem to exhibit mostly small glitches, matching well the\ndecrease of their crustal superfluid.\n  Through the analysis of glitch sizes it was found that the particular\nglitching behaviour of PSR J0537-6910 and the Vela pulsar may be shared by most\nVela-like pulsars.

The most\nprominent of these problems include (a) the existence of network codes that\nachieve maximum rate of transmission, (b) efficient network code constructions,\nand (c) field size issues. In practice, however, networks have transmission\ndelays. In network coding theory, such networks with transmission delays are\ngenerally abstracted by assuming that their edges have integer delays. Note\nthat using enough memory at the nodes of an acyclic network with integer delays\ncan effectively simulate instantaneous behavior, which is probably why only\nacyclic instantaneous networks have been primarily focused on thus far. In this\nwork, we elaborate on issues ((a), (b) and (c) above) related to network coding\nfor acyclic networks with integer delays, which have till now mostly been\noverlooked. We show that the delays associated with the edges of the network\ncannot be ignored, and in fact turn out to be advantageous, disadvantageous or\nimmaterial, depending on the topology of the network and the problem considered\ni.e., (a), (b) or (c). In the process, we also show that for a single source\nmulticast problem in acyclic networks (instantaneous and with delays), the\nnetwork coding operations at each node can simply be limited to storing old\nsymbols and coding them over a binary field. Therefore, operations over\nelements of larger fields are unnecessary in the network, the trade-off being\nthat enough memory exists at the nodes and at the sinks, and that the sinks\nhave more processing power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 05:07:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 07:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2013 11:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

One of the conditions for the SOC is the slow driving noise, which\nunambiguously suggests Stratonovich interpretation of the corresponding\nstochastic differential equation (SDE). This, in turn, necessitates the use of\nParisi-Sourlas-Wu stochastic quantization procedure, which straightforwardly\nleads to a model with BRST-exact action, i.e., to a W-TFT. In the parameter\nspace of the SDE, there must exist full-dimensional regions where the\nBRST-symmetry is spontaneously broken by instantons, which in the context of\nSOC are essentially avalanches. In these regions, the avalanche-type SOC\ndynamics is liberated from overwise a rightful dynamics-less W-TFT, and a\nGoldstone mode of Fadeev-Popov ghosts exists. Goldstinos represent modulii of\ninstantons (avalanches) and being gapless are responsible for the critical\navalanche distribution in the low-energy, long-wavelength limit. The above\narguments are robust against moderate variations of the SDE's parameters and\nthe criticality is \"self-tuned\". The proposition of this paper suggests that\nthe machinery of W-TFTs may find its applications in many different areas of\nmodern science studying various physical realizations of SOC. It also suggests\nthat there may in principle exist a connection between some of SOC's and the\nconcept of topological quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 06:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 19:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-03"}

Two distinct classes of electronic states are\nobserved in both the d-wave superconducting (dSC) and the pseudogap (PG)\nphases. The first class consists of the dispersive Bogoliubov quasiparticle\nexcitations of a homogeneous d-wave superconductor, existing below a lower\nenergy scale E=Delta0. We find that the Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference\nsignatures of delocalized Cooper pairing are restricted to a k-space arc which\nterminates near the lines connecting k=\\pm(pi/a0,0) to k=\\pm(pi/a0). This arc\nshrinks continuously with decreasing hole density such that Luttinger's theorem\ncould be satisfied if it represents the front side of a hole-pocket which is\nbounded behind by the lines between k=\\pm(pi/a0,0) and k=\\pm(0,pi/a0). In both\nphases the only broken symmetries detected for the |E|<Delta0 states are those\nof a d-wave superconductor. The second class of states occurs proximate to the\npseudogap energy scale E=Delta1. Here the non-dispersive electronic structure\nbreaks the expected 90o-rotational symmetry of electronic structure within each\nunit cell, at least down to 180o-rotational symmetry. This Q=0 electronic\nsymmetry breaking was first detected as an electronic inequivalence at the two\noxygen sites within each unit cell by using a measure of nematic (C2) symmetry.\nIncommensurate non-dispersive conductance modulations, locally breaking both\nrotational and translational symmetries, coexist with this intra-unit-cell\nelectronic symmetry breaking at E=Delta1. Their characteristic wavevector Q is\ndetermined by the k-space points where Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference\nterminates and therefore changes continuously with doping. The distinct broken\nelectronic symmetry states (Q=0 and finite Q) coexisting at E~Delta1 are found\nto be indistinguishable in the dSC and PG phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 08:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

It is difficult to conceive an\nexpanding universe with a strictly constant vacuum energy density, namely one\nthat has remained immutable since the origin of time. A smoothly evolving\nvacuum energy density that inherits its time-dependence from cosmological\nfunctions, such as the Hubble rate or the scale factor, is not only a\nqualitatively more plausible and intuitive idea, but is also suggested by\nfundamental physics, in particular by quantum field theory (QFT) in curved\nspace-time. To implement this notion, is not strictly necessary to resort to ad\nhoc scalar fields, as usually done in the literature (e.g. in quintessence\nformulations and the like). A \"running\" Lambda term can be expected on very\nsimilar grounds as one expects (and observes) the running of couplings and\nmasses with a physical energy scale in QFT. Furthermore, the experimental\nevidence that the equation of state of the dark energy could be evolving with\ntime/redshift (including the possibility that it might currently behave\nphantom-like) suggests that a time-variable Lambda term (possibly accompanied\nby a variable Newton's gravitational coupling G=G(t)) could account in a\nnatural way for all these features. Remarkably enough, a class of these models\n(the \"new cosmon\") could even be the clue for solving the old cosmological\nconstant problem, including the coincidence problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 09:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

About half of this\nbackground, called the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) is emitted in the\n8-1000 microns range, and peaks around 150 microns. It is due to the dust\nreemission from star formation processes and AGN emission. The CIB spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) constraints the models of star formation in the\nUniverse. It is also useful to compute the opacity of the Universe to the TeV\nphotons.\n  We present the different types of measurements of the CIB and discuss their\nstrengths and weaknesses.\n  1. The absolute SED was measured by COBE, and by other experiments. These\nmeasurements are limited by the accuracy of the component separation, i.e. the\nforeground subtraction.\n  2. Robust lower limits are determined from the extragalactic number counts of\ninfrared galaxies. These lower limits are very stringent up to 100 microns. At\nlarger wavelengths, the rather low angular resolution of the instruments limits\nstrongly the depth of the number counts. The \"stacking\" method determines the\nflux emitted at a given wavelength by a population detected at another\nwavelength, and provides stringent lower limits in the sub-mm range. It is\ncomplementary with other methods based on the statistical analysis of the map\nproperties like the P(D) analysis.\n  3. Finally, upper limits can be derived from the high energy spectra of\nextragalactic sources. These upper limits give currently good constraints in\nthe near- and mid-IR.\n  Progress have been amazing since the CIB discovery about 15 years ago: the\nSED is much better known, and most of it can be accounted for by galaxies\n(directly or indirectly).

The platelets are assumed to\ninteract like hard objects, but additional soft attractive and repulsive\ninteractions, meant to represent the effect of depletion interactions are also\nconsidered. The aspect (diameter to thickness) ratio is taken to be very high,\nin order to model solutions of mineral platelets recently explored\nexperimentally. In this regime a high degree of orientational ordering occurs;\ntherefore the model platelets can be taken as completely parallel and are\namenable to analysis via a fundamental-measure theory. Our focus is on the\nnematic vs. smectic phase interplay, since a high degree of polydispersity in\ndiameter suppresses the formation of the columnar phase. When interactions are\npurely hard, the theory predicts a continuous nematic-to-smectic transition,\nregardless of the degree of diameter polydispersity. However, polydispersity\nenhances the stability of the smectic phase against the nematic phase.\nPredictions for the case where an additional soft interaction is added are\nobtained using mean-field perturbation theory. In the case of the one-component\nfluid, the transition remains continuous for repulsive forces, and the smectic\nphase becomes more stable as the range of the interaction is decreased. The\nopposite behaviour with respect to the range is observed for attractive forces,\nand in fact the transition becomes of first order below a tricritical point.\nAlso, for attractive interactions, nematic demixing appears, with an associated\ncritical point.

We show that the\nvertical surface density profile of the post-merger thick disk follows a sech\nfunction and has an excess in the regions far from the disk mid-plane (z>2kpc).\nThis stellar excess also follows a sech function with a larger scale height\nthan the main thick disk component, and it is usually dominated by stars from\nthe primary galaxy. Stars in the excess have a rotational velocity lower than\nthat of stars in the thick disk, and they may thus be confused with stars in\nthe inner galactic halo. The thick disk scale height increases with radius and\nthe rate of its increase is smaller for more gas rich primary galaxies. On the\ncontrary, the scale height of the stellar excess is independent of both radius\nand gas fraction. We also find that the post-merger thick disk has a radial\nscale length which is 10-50% larger than that of the thin disk. Two consecutive\nmergers have basically the same effect on heating the stellar disk as a single\nmerger of the same total mass. To investigate how thick disks produced through\nsecular processes may differ from those produced by minor mergers, we also\nsimulated gravitationally unstable gas-rich disks. These disks do not produce\neither a stellar excess or a ratio of thick to thin disk scale lengths greater\nthan one. Our simulation results are consistent with observations of the ratio\nof thick to thin disk scale lengths of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, and\nwith the Toomre diagram of the Milky Way.

An olog is similar to a relational database\nschema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike\ndatabase schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are\ndesigned to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is\na matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to\nauthor ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language,\ndespite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many\nexamples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can\nbe described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected\ntogether into a larger network using functors.

Whether this phase\ntransformation was fully driven and completed by photoionization by young hot\nstars is a question of topical interest in cosmology. AIMS. We propose here\nthat besides the ultraviolet radiation from massive stars, feedback from\naccreting black holes in high-mass X-ray binaries (BH-HMXBs) was an additional,\nimportant source of heating and reionization of the IGM in regions of low gas\ndensity at large distances from star-forming galaxies. METHODS. We use current\ntheoretical models on the formation and evolution of primitive massive stars of\nlow metallicity, and the observations of compact stellar remnants in the near\nand distant universe, to infer that a significant fraction of the first\ngenerations of massive stars end up as BH-HMXBs. The total number of energetic\nionizing photons from an accreting stellar black hole in an HMXB is comparable\nto the total number of ionizing photons of its progenitor star. However, the\nX-ray photons emitted by the accreting black hole are capable of producing\nseveral secondary ionizations and the ionizing power of the resulting black\nhole could be greater than that of its progenitor. Feedback by the large\npopulations of BH-HMXBs heats the IGM to temperatures of ~10^4 K and maintains\nit ionized on large distance scales. BH-HMXBs determine the early thermal\nhistory of the universe and mantain it as ionized over large volumes of space\nin regions of low density. This has a direct impact on the properties of the\nfaintest galaxies at high redshifts, the smallest dwarf galaxies in the local\nuniverse, and on the existing and future surveys at radio wavelengths of atomic\nhydrogen in the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 15:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
