But it is ruled out on many counts: inappropriately low\nquark and lepton masses (or excessive FCNC), bad electroweak data fits, light\nscalar and vector states, etc. However, nature may not choose the minimal model\nand then we are stuck: except possibly through lattice simulations, we are\nunable to compute and test the models.

Here we report on a basic theoretical\ninvestigation of the linear polarization produced by scattering processes and\nthe Hanle effect in Ly-a, Ly-b and H-a taking into account multilevel radiative\ntransfer effects in an isothermal stellar atmosphere model, the fine-structure\nof the hydrogen levels, as well as the impact of collisions with electrons and\nprotons. The main aim of this first paper is to elucidate the physical\nmechanisms that control the linear polarization in the three lines, as well as\nits sensitivity to the perturbers density and to the strength and structure of\nmicro-structured and deterministic magnetic fields. To this end, we apply an\nefficient radiative transfer code we have developed for performing numerical\nsimulations of the Hanle effect in multilevel systems with overlapping line\ntransitions. For low density plasmas such as that of the upper solar\nchromosphere collisional depolarization is caused mainly by collisional\ntransitions between the fine-structure levels of n=3, so that it is virtually\ninsignificant for Ly-a but important for Ly-b and H-a. We show the impact of\nthe Hanle effect on the three lines taking into account the radiative transfer\ncoupling between the different hydrogen line transitions. For example, we\ndemonstrate that the linear polarization profile of the H-a line is sensitive\nto the presence of magnetic field gradients in the line core formation region\nand that in solar-like chromospheres selective absorption of polarization\ncomponents does not play any significant role on the emergent scattering\npolarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2011 18:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-22"}

Especially de novo sequencing, the identification of a peptide from\nits spectrum alone, is still a challenge even for state-of-the-art algorithmic\napproaches. In this paper we present Antilope, a new fast and flexible approach\nbased on mathematical programming. It builds on the spectrum graph model and\nworks with a variety of scoring schemes. Antilope combines Lagrangian\nrelaxation for solving an integer linear programming formulation with an\nadaptation of Yen's k shortest paths algorithm. It shows a significant\nimprovement in running time compared to mixed integer optimization and performs\nat the same speed like other state-of-the-art tools. We also implemented a\ngeneric probabilistic scoring scheme that can be trained automatically for a\ndataset of annotated spectra and is independent of the mass spectrometer type.\nEvaluations on benchmark data show that Antilope is competitive to the popular\nstate-of-the-art programs PepNovo and NovoHMM both in terms of run time and\naccuracy. Furthermore, it offers increased flexibility in the number of\nconsidered ion types. Antilope will be freely available as part of the open\nsource proteomics library OpenMS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2011 19:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-29"}

Some processes, such as the transport of\ncargoes is achieved mainly by the action of individual motors. Other, such as\ncell motility and division, require the cooperative work of many motors.\nCollective motor dynamics can be quite complex and unexpected. One beautiful\nexample is the bidirectional (\"back and forth\") motion of filaments which is\ninduced when the motors within a group exert forces in opposite directions.\nThis review tackles the puzzle emerging from a recent experimental work in\nwhich it has been shown that the characteristic reversal times of the\nbidirectional motion are practically independent of the number of motors. This\nresult is in a striking contradiction with existing theoretical models that\npredict an exponential growth of the reversal times with the size of the\nsystem. We argue that the solution to this puzzle may be the crosstalk between\nthe motors which is mediated by the elastic tensile stress that develops in the\ncytoskeleton track. The crosstalk does not directly correlate the attachment\nand detachment of the motors, which work independently of each other. However,\nit highly accelerates their detachments by making the detachment rates system\nsize dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2011 10:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-25"}

In particular, we investigate the nature of the large eigenvalue\nbulks which are observed empirically, and which have often been regarded as a\nconsequence of the supposedly large amount of noise contained in financial\ndata. We challenge this common knowledge by acting on the empirical correlation\nmatrices of two data sets with a filtering procedure which highlights some of\nthe cluster structure they contain, and we analyze the consequences of such\nfiltering on eigenvalue spectra. We show that empirically observed eigenvalue\nbulks emerge as superpositions of smaller structures, which in turn emerge as a\nconsequence of cross-correlations between stocks. We interpret and corroborate\nthese findings in terms of factor models, and and we compare empirical spectra\nto those predicted by Random Matrix Theory for such models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2011 15:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Methods-We represent the heart as an anisotropic cylinder. This simple\ngeometry allows us to obtain analytical solutions for the potential, current\ndensity, charge, stress, and strain. Results-Charge induced on the heart\nsurface in the presence of the electric field results in forces that deform the\nheart. In addition, the anisotropy of cardiac tissue creates a charge density\nthroughout the tissue volume, leading to body forces. These two forces cause\nthe tissue to deform in a complicated manner, with the anisotropy suppressing\nradial displacements in favor of tangential ones. Quantitatively, the\ndeformation of the tissue is small, although it may be significant when using\nsome imaging techniques that require the measurement of small displacements.\nConclusions-The anisotropy of cardiac tissue produces qualitatively new\nmechanical behavior during a strong, defibrillation-strength electric shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2011 15:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-22"}

In the present study, the geometry of the tunnel roof is assumed\nsemi-circular which is covered with a UV (200\\mu) stabilized polyethylene film.\nThe simulated SGTD reduces moisture of copra from 52.2% to 8% in 55 h under\nfull load conditions. A system of partial differential equations describing\nheat and moisture transfer during drying copra in the solar greenhouse dryer\nwas developed and this system of non-linear partial differential equations was\nsolved numerically using the finite difference method (FDM). The numerical\nsolution was programmed in Compaq Visual FORTRAN version 6.5. The simulated\nresults reasonably agreed with the experimental data for solar drying copra.\nThis model can be used to provide the design data and is also essential for\noptimal design of the dryer. For instance the user is able to change the\nradiation properties of the roof cover for different materials of roof cover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2011 16:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-23"}
