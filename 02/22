This decomposition is non-local\nand depends on unknowable boundary conditions. The non-locality is particularly\nimportant at second- and higher-order because perturbative modes are sourced by\nproducts of lower-oder modes, which must be integrated over all space in order\nto isolate each mode. However, given a trace-free rank-2 tensor, a locally\ndefined scalar mode may be trivially derived by taking two divergences, which\nknocks out the vector and tensor degrees of freedom. A similar local\ndifferential operation will return a pure vector mode. This means that scalar\nand vector degrees of freedom have local descriptions. The corresponding local\nextraction of the tensor mode is unknown however. We give it here. The\noperators we define are useful for defining gauge-invariant quantities at\nsecond-order. We perform much of our analysis using an index-free\n`vector-calculus' approach which makes manipulating tensor equations\nconsiderably simpler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 16:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 13:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 12:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The survey\nhas a high degree of uniformity thanks to the stable point spread function and\nsmall vignetting correction factors of the XRT, moreover is completely random\non the sky as GRBs explode in totally unrelated parts of the sky. In this paper\nwe present the sample and the X-ray number counts of the high Galactic-latitude\nsample, estimated with high statistics over a wide flux range (i.e., 7.2e-16 to\n~5e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5-2 keV band and 3.4e-15 to ~6e-13 erg cm^-2\ns^-1 in the 2-10 keV band). We detect 9387 point-like sources, while 7071\npoint-like sources are found at high Galactic-latitudes (i.e. >=20 deg). The\nlarge number of detected sources resulting from the combination of large area\nand deep flux limits make this survey a new important tool for investigating\nthe evolution of AGN. In particular, the large area permits finding rare\nhigh-luminosity objects like QSO2, which are poorly sampled by other surveys,\nadding precious information for the luminosity function bright end. The high\nGalactic-latitude logN-logS relation is well determined over all the flux\ncoverage, and it is nicely consistent with previous results at 1 sigma\nconfidence level. By the hard X-ray color analysis, we find that the Swift\nSerendipitous Survey in deep XRT GRB fields samples relatively unobscured and\nmildly obscured AGN, with a fraction of obscured sources of ~37% (~15%) in the\n2-10 (0.3-3 keV) band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 16:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The collapse forms much\ndenser fluid configurations, closely resembling isolated proto-giant planets on\nthe Hayashi track before they enter the degenerate \"main sequence\" phase.

The disruption is likely to leave solid cores behind, which\nwe identify with the hot Super-Earths observed by Kepler.

The principal\npulsation mode is an oblique dipole mode that shows a rotationally split\nfrequency septuplet that provides information on the geometry of the mode. The\nsecondary mode also appears to be a dipole mode with a rotationally split\ntriplet, but we are able to show within the improved oblique pulsator model\nthat these two modes cannot have the same axis of pulsation. This is the first\ntime for any pulsating star that evidence has been found for separate pulsation\naxes for different modes. The two modes are separated in frequency by 55\nmicroHz, which we model as the large separation. The star is an alpha^2 CVn\nspotted magnetic variable that shows a complex rotational light variation with\na period of Prot = 5.68459 d.

The aim of this investigation is to study the\ntime-dependent response of a star's surface as it is perturbed by a binary\ncompanion. We derive expressions for the rate of dissipation, $\\dot{E}$, of the\nkinetic energy by the viscous flows driven by tidal interactions on the surface\nlayer. The method is tested by comparing the results from a grid of model\ncalculations with the analytical predictions of Hut (1981) and the\nsynchronization timescales of Zahn (1977, 2008). Our results for the orbital\ncycle averaged energy dissipation on orbital separation are consistent with\nthose of Hut for model binaries with orbital separations at periastron >8\nstellar radii. The model also reproduces the predicted pseudo-synchronization\nangular velocity for moderate eccentricities and the same scaling of\nsynchronization timescales for circular orbits with separation as given by\nZahn. The computations gives the distribution of $\\dot{E}$ over the stellar\nsurface, and show that it is generally concentrated at the equatorial latitude,\nwith maxima generally located around four clearly defined longitudes,\ncorresponding to the fastest azimuthal velocity perturbations. Maximum\namplitudes occur around periastron passage or slightly thereafter for\nsupersynchronously rotating stars. In very eccentric binaries, the distribution\nof $\\dot{E}$ over the surface changes significantly as a function of orbital\nphase, with small spatial structures appearing after periastron. An exploratory\ncalculation for the highly eccentric binary system delta Sco suggests that the\nsudden and large amplitude variations in surface properties around periastron\nmay contribute toward the activity observed around this orbital phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 18:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

For this purpose we make use of elementary quantum field\ntheory and Glaubers theory for photon detection in order to calculate the\nexpected interference pattern in the MMI. If a thermal reference source is used\nin the MMI local oscillator port in combination with a thermal source in the\nsignal port, the interference pattern revealed by such an intensity measurement\nshows a distinctive dependence on the differences in the temperature of the two\nsources. The MMI can therefore be used in order to perform temperature\nmeasurements. A related method was actually used to carry out high precision\nmeasurements of the cosmic micro-wave background radiation on board of the COBE\nsatellite. The theoretical framework allows us to consider any initial quantum\nstate. The interference of single photons as a tool to determine the angular\npeak-frequency of a one-photon pulse interfering with a single-photon reference\npulse is, e.g., considered. A similar consideration for coherent laser pulses\nleads to a different response in the detector.

This is the largest dataset ever used for such an analysis\nand it allows us to explore the outskirts of massive red galaxies at\nunprecedented physical scales. Our image stacks extend farther than 400 kpc,\nwhere the r-band profile surface brightness reaches 30 mag arcsec-2. This\nanalysis confirms that the stellar bodies of luminous red galaxies follow a\nsimple Sersic profile out to 100 kpc. At larger radii the profiles deviate from\nthe best-fit Sersic models and exhibit extra light in the g, r, i and z-band\nstacks. This excess light can probably be attributed to unresolved intragroup\nor intracluster light or a change in the light profile itself. We further show\nthat standard analyses of SDSS-depth images typically miss 20% of the total\nstellar light and underestimate the size of LRGs by 10% compared to our best\nfit r-band Sersic model of n=5.5 and r_e=13.1 kpc. If the excess light at r>100\nkpc is considered to be part of the galaxy, the best fit r-band Sersic\nparameters are n=5.8 and r_e=13.6 kpc. In addition we study the radially\ndependent stack ellipticity and find an increase with radius from e=0.25 at\nr=10 kpc to e=0.3 at r=100 kpc. This provides support that the stellar light\nthat we trace out to at least 100 kpc is physically associated with the\ngalaxies themselves and may confirm that the halos of individual LRGs have\nhigher ellipticities than their central parts. Lastly we show that the\nbroadband color gradients of the stacked images are flat beyond roughly 40 kpc,\nsuggesting that the stellar populations do not vary significantly with radius\nin the outer parts of massive ellipticals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Finding the origin of this variability would constrain the still\nlargely unknown properties of this extraordinary object. Since it exhibits an\nintensity-hardness behavior characteristic of black-hole X-ray transients, we\nhave analyzed the variability of HLX-1 in the framework of the disk instability\nmodel that explains outbursts of such systems. We find that the long-term\nvariability of HLX-1 is unlikely to be explained by a model in which outbursts\nare triggered by thermal-viscous instabilities in an accretion disc. Possible\nalternatives include the instability in a radiation-pressure dominated disk but\nwe argue that a more likely explanation is a modulated mass-transfer due to\ntidal stripping of a star on an eccentric orbit around the intermediate-mass\nblack hole. We consider an evolutionary scenario leading to the creation of\nsuch a system and estimate the probability of its observation. We conclude,\nusing a simplified dynamical model of the post-collapse cluster, that no more\nthan 1/100 to 1/10 of Mbh < 10^4 Msun IMBHs - formed by run-away stellar\nmergers in the dense collapsed cores of young clusters - could have a few times\n1 Msun Main-Sequence star evolve to an AGB on an orbit eccentric enough for\nmass transfer at periapse, while avoiding collisional destruction or being\nscattered into the IMBH by 2-body encounters. The finite but low probability of\nthis configuration is consistent with the uniqueness of HLX-1. We note,\nhowever, that the actual response of a standard accretion disk to bursts of\nmass transfer may be too slow to explain the observations unless the orbit is\nclose to parabolic (and hence even rarer) and/or additional heating, presumably\nlinked to the highly time-dependent gravitational potential, are invoked.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 09:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2011 13:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

When $M_{crit}$ is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD,\nthe WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces a delay between\nthe time at which the WD has completed its epoch of mass gain and the time of\nthe explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore\nhas a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a\ndensity similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also,\neither by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion,\nthe donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD.

We\nstudy the growth of the clustering dipole of galaxies as a function of the\nlimiting flux of the sample from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS).\nContrary to some earlier claims, we find that the dipole does not converge\nbefore the completeness limit of the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog, i.e. up to\n13.5 mag in the near-infrared K_s band (equivalent to an effective distance of\n300 Mpc/h). We compare the observed growth of the dipole with the theoretically\nexpected, conditional one (i.e., given the velocity of the Local Group relative\nto the CMB), for the LambdaCDM power spectrum and cosmological parameters\nconstrained by WMAP. The observed growth turns out to be within 1-sigma\nconfidence level of its theoretical counterpart once the proper observational\nwindow of the 2MASS flux-limited catalog is included. For a contrast, if the\nadopted window is a top-hat, then the predicted dipole grows significantly\nfaster and converges to its final value for a distance of about 300 Mpc/h. By\ncomparing the observational windows, we show that for a given flux limit and a\ncorresponding distance limit, the 2MASS flux-weighted window passes less\nlarge-scale signal than the top-hat one. We conclude that the growth of the\n2MASS dipole for effective distances greater than 200 Mpc/h is only apparent.\nOn the other hand, for a distance of 80 Mpc/h (mean depth of the 2MASS Redshift\nSurvey) and the LambdaCDM power spectrum, the true dipole is expected to reach\nonly ~80% of its final value. Eventually, since for the window function of\n2MASS the predicted growth is consistent with the observed one, we can compare\nthe two to evaluate beta = (Omega_m)^0.55 / b. The result is beta = 0.38+-0.04,\nwhich leads to an estimate of the density parameter Omega_m = 0.20+-0.08.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 21:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 17:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 10:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The results of analyses strongly suggest\nthat the molecular excitations below T_N arise from a hidden molecular-singlet\nground state, in which ferromagnetic subunits are antiferromagnetically\ncoupled. The quasielastic excitations above T_N are interpreted as its\nprecursor. A combination of frustration and J_eff = 1/2 might induce these\nquantum phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 03:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-18"}

We investigate the equilibrium\nand dynamical evolution of isothermal and self-gravitating system embedded in\npotential well, which can be the situation of many astrophysical objects such\nas the central parts of the galaxies, or clusters of galaxies with potential\ndominated by dark matter, but is still limited to the case where the potential\nwell is fixed during the evolution. As the ratio between the depth of\nsurrounding potential well and potential of embedded system becomes large, the\npotential well becomes effectively the same boundary condition as conducting\nwall, which behaves like a thermal heat bath. We also use the direct N-body\nsimulation code, NBODY6 to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar system\nembedded in potential wells and propose the equilibrium models for this system.\nIn deep potential well, which is analogous to the heat bath with high\ntemperature, the embedded self-gravitating system is dynamically hot, and\nloosely bound or can be unbound since the kinetic energy increases due to the\nheating by the potential well. On the other hand, the system undergoes core\ncollapse by self-gravity when potential well is shallow. Binary heating can\nstop the collapse and leads to the expansion, but the evolution is very slow\nbecause the potential as a heat bath can absorb the energy generated by the\nbinaries. The system can be regarded as quasi-static. Density and velocity\ndispersion profiles from the N-body simulations in the final quasi-equilibrium\nstate are similar to our equilibrium models assumed to be in thermal\nequilibrium with the potential well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 06:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The Casimir force acting on a planar piston that can move\nfreely inside a closed cylinder with the same cross section is investigated.\nDifferent combinations of perfectly conducting boundary conditions and\ninfinitely permeable boundary conditions are imposed on the cylinder and the\npiston.

We adopt the nonparametric approach initially\nintroduced by Dear (1992) but impose that the weight function $w$ is monotonely\nnon-increasing as a function of the $p$-value. Since in meta analysis one\ntypically only has few studies or \"observations\", regularization of the\nestimation problem seems sensible. In addition, virtually all parametric weight\nfunctions proposed so far in the literature are in fact decreasing. We discuss\nhow to estimate a decreasing weight function in the above model and illustrate\nthe new methodology on two well-known examples. The new approach potentially\noffers more insight in the selection process than other methods and is more\nflexible than parametric approaches. Some basic properties of the\nlog-likelihood function and computation of a $p$-value quantifying the evidence\nagainst the null hypothesis of a constant weight function are indicated.

Our complete sample of 260 ETGs\nleads to a new criterion to disentangle Fast and Slow Rotators which now\nincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (Epsilon). It separates the\ntwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than a\ncriterion based on V/Sigma: Slow Rotators and Fast Rotators have LambdaR lower\nand larger than kFSxSQRT(Epsilon), respectively, where kFS=0.31 for\nmeasurements made within 1 Re. We show that the vast majority of early-type\ngalaxies are Fast Rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with aligned\nphotometric and kinematic axes (Paper II, Krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discs\nand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in the\nvolume-limited ATLAS3D sample.

The standard stars BD+59d389 (polarized) and HD14069 (unpolarized)\nwere observed with CAFOS in November, 2010, using 16 half-wave plate angles.\nThe linear spectropolarimetric properties of CAFOS were studied using a Fourier\nAnalysis of the resulting data.\n  Results. CAFOS shows a roughly constant instrumental polarization at the\nlevel of ~0.3% between 4000 and 8600 A. Below 4000 A the spurious polarization\ngrows to reach ~0.7% at 3600 A. This instrumental effect is most likely\nproduced by the telescope optics, and appears to be additive. The Wollaston\nprism presents a clear deviation from the ideal behavior. The problem is\nlargely removed by the usage of at least 4 retarder plate angles. The\nchromatism of the half-wave plate causes a peak-to-peak oscillation of ~11\ndegrees in the polarization angle. This can be effectively corrected using the\ntabulated values presented in this paper. The Fourier analysis shows that the\nk!=0,4 harmonics are practically negligible between 3800 and 7400 A.\n  Conclusions.

The light curve is characterized by\nstrong oscillations of peak to peak amplitude of 2 to more than 3 magnitudes.\nBefore the gap the fluctuations were modulated mainly by a period Pa=1373 d,\nthe diurnal cycle of an observer on the surface of the rotating M giant, whose\nsun is the hot component. After the gap the dominant periodicity is Pb=1256 d,\nwhich is the binary period of the system. Higher harmonics as well as a few\nbeats of the two major periodicities can also be identified in the light curve.\nWe identify one of the beat periods, Pr=656 d, as the sidereal rotation period\nof the giant component of the system. The period switching that took place\nduring the gap in the observations was possibly associated with a certain\ncataclysmic event, hints of which may be recognized in the LC in the first 11\nyears after the gap.

It may have originated (i) as the\nresponse of the disc to perturbations excited by satellite companions or (ii)\nfrom the tidal debris of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. The metallicity of Monoceros\nstars differs from that of disc stars at comparable Galactocentric distances,\nan observation that disfavours the first scenario. On the other hand, circular\norbits are difficult to accommodate in the tidal-disruption scenario, since it\nrequires a satellite which at the time of disruption was itself in a nearly\ncircular orbit. Such satellite could not have formed at the location of the\nring and, given its low mass, dynamical friction is unlikely to have played a\nmajor role in its orbital evolution. We search cosmological simulations for\nlow-mass satellites in nearly-circular orbits and find that they result, almost\ninvariably, from orbital changes induced by collisions with more massive\nsatellites: the radius of the circular orbit thus traces the galactocentric\ndistance of the collision. Interestingly, the Sagittarius dwarf, one of the\nmost luminous satellites of the Milky Way, is in a polar orbit that crosses the\nGalactic plane at roughly the same Galactocentric distance as Monoceros.

The necessary degrees of\nrelaxation are quantified here, via natural distance and information-theoretic\nmeasures. This allows quantitative comparisons between different models in\nterms of the resources, such as the number of bits, of randomness,\ncommunication, and/or correlation, that they require. For example, measurement\ndependence is a relatively strong resource for modeling singlet state\ncorrelations, with only 1/15 of one bit of correlation required between\nmeasurement settings and the underlying variable. It is shown how various\n'relaxed' Bell inequalities may be obtained, which precisely specify the\ncomplementary degrees of relaxation required to model any given violation of a\nstandard Bell inequality. The robustness of a class of Kochen-Specker theorems,\nto relaxation of measurement independence, is also investigated. It is shown\nthat a theorem of Mermin remains valid unless measurement independence is\nrelaxed by 1/3. The Conway-Kochen 'free will' theorem and a result of Hardy are\nless robust, failing if measurement independence is relaxed by only 6.5% and\n4.5%, respectively.

Explicit results are provided for the entropic risk measure\n(for which the optimal portfolio always exists) and for the class of spectral\nrisk measures (for which the optimal portfolio may fail to exist in some\ncases).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 12:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-23"}

In this work we conduct a comparative theoretical\nstudy of the weak antilocalization in HgTe quantum wells and topological\nsurface states. The difference between these two single-valley systems comes\nfrom a finite band gap (effective Dirac mass) in HgTe quantum wells in contrast\nto gapless (massless) surface states in topological insulators. The finite\neffective Dirac mass implies a broken internal symmetry, leading to suppression\nof the weak antilocalization in HgTe quantum wells at times larger than certain\nt_M, inversely proportional to the Dirac mass. This corresponds to the opening\nof a relaxation gap 1/t_M in the Cooperon diffusion mode which we obtain from\nthe Bethe-Salpeter equation including relevant spin degrees of freedom. We\ndemonstrate that the relaxation gap exhibits an interesting nonmonotonic\ndependence on both carrier density and band gap, vanishing at a certain\ncombination of these parameters. The weak-antilocalization conductivity\nreflects this nonmonotonic behavior which is unique to HgTe QWs and absent for\ntopological surface states. On the other hand, the topological surface states\nexhibit specific weak-antilocalization magnetoconductivity in a parallel\nmagnetic field due to their exponential decay in the bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 14:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 12:04:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 09:37:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2011 11:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

This procedure consists in choosing,\nfor a given theory $\\mathcal T$ and classical language $\\mathcal L$ expressing\n$\\mathcal T$, an observative sublanguage $L$ of $\\mathcal L$ with a notion of\ntruth as correspondence, introducing in $L$ a derived and theory-dependent\nnotion of \\emph{C-truth} (\\emph{true with certainty}), defining a\n\\emph{physical preorder} induced by C-truth, and finally selecting a set of\nsentences that are \\emph{verifiable} (or \\emph{testable}) according to\n$\\mathcal T$, on which a \\emph{weak complementation} is induced by $\\mathcal\nT$. The triple consisting of the set of verifiable sentences, physical order\nand weak complementation is then the desired concrete logic. By applying our\nprocedure we recover a classical logic as the concrete logic associated with\nclassical mechanics and standard quantum logic as the concrete logic associated\nwith quantum mechanics. We also show that our alternative view of standard\nquantum logic, which can be constructed in a purely formal way, can be provided\nwith a physical meaning by adopting a recent interpretation of quantum\nmechanics that reinterprets quantum probabilities as conditional on detection\nrather than absolute. Our results then show that some nonstandard logics can be\nobtained as mathematical structures formalizing the properties of different\nnotions of verifiability in different physical theories. More generally, they\nstrongly support the idea that many nonclassical logics can coexist without\nconflicting with classical logic (\\emph{global pluralism}), for they formalize\nmetalinguistic notions that do not coincide with the notion of truth (described\nby Tarski's truth theory).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 15:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

This conclusion is in visible contradiction with the lattice results\nindicating triviality of \\phi^4 theory. This contradiction is resolved by a\nspecial character of renormalizability in \\phi^4 theory: to obtain the\ncontinuous renormalized theory, there is no need to eliminate a lattice from\nthe bare theory. In fact, such kind of renormalizability is not accidental and\ncan be understood in the framework of Wilson's many-parameter renormalization\ngroup. Application of these ideas to QCD shows that Wilson's theory of\nconfinement is not purely illustrative, but has a direct relation to a real\nsituation.
