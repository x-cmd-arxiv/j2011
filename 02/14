In this paper, also with semiclassical analysis, it shows that so long\nas the mechanism of black hole evaporation satisfies a quite loose condition\nthat the evaporation lifespan is finite for external observers, regardless of\nthe detailed mechanism and process of evaporation, the conundrums above can be\nnaturally avoided. This condition can be satisfied with Hawking-Unruh\nmechanism. Thus, the conflict between quantum theory and classical gravity\ntheory may be not as serious as it seemed to be, the effectiveness of\nsemiclassical methods might be underestimated.\n  An exact universal solution with spherical symmetry of Einstein field\nequation has been derived in this paper. All possible solutions with spherical\nsymmetry of Einstein field equation are its special cases.\n  In addition, some problems of the Penrose diagram of an evaporating black\nhole first introduced by Hawking in 1975 \\cite{Hawking1975} are clarified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2011 16:05:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 16:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

To date, most methods used to\ncompute such communities stem from the field of disjoint community detection by\neither extending the concept of modularity to an overlapping context or by\nattempting to decompose the whole set of nodes into several possibly\noverlapping subsets. In this report we take an orthogonal approach by\nintroducing a metric, the cohesion, rooted in sociological considerations. The\ncohesion quantifies the community-ness of one given set of nodes, based on the\nnotions of triangles - triplets of connected nodes - and weak ties, instead of\nthe classical view using only edge density. A set of nodes has a high cohesion\nif it features a high density of triangles and intersects few triangles with\nthe rest of the network. As such, we introduce a numerical characterization of\ncommunities: sets of nodes featuring a high cohesion. We then present a new\napproach to the problem of overlapping communities by introducing the concept\nof ego-munities, which are subjective communities centered around a given node,\nspecifically inside its neighborhood. We build upon the cohesion to construct a\nheuristic algorithm which outputs a node's ego-munities by attempting to\nmaximize their cohesion. We illustrate the pertinence of our method with a\ndetailed description of one person's ego-munities among Facebook friends.

This is, however,\nin principle limited to redexes and created redexes that are 'visible' (in the\nsense that they can be contracted without the need for unsharing), and cannot\ngenerally be extended to redexes that are concealed by sharing constructs such\nas letrec.

All these scenarios occur in\nhyperbolic models with negative averaged and local spatial curvature, though\nscenarios (iv) and (v) are also possible in low density regions of a class of\nelliptic models in which local spatial curvature is negative but its average is\npositive. Rough numerical estimates between -0.003 and -0.5 were found for the\neffective deceleration parameter. While the existence of accelerating domains\ncannot be ruled out in models converging to an Einstein de Sitter background\nand in domains undergoing gravitational collapse, the conditions for this are\nvery restrictive. The results obtained may provide important theoretical clues\non the effects of back-reaction and averaging in more general non-spherical\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 02:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 19:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Using our framework, we provide fundamental bounds on the number of\nnoiseless measurements that each sensor must collect to ensure that the signals\nare jointly recoverable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 05:39:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 22:31:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 00:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-29"}

A\nproblem previously considered is finding a minimax average length source code.\nThe minimizing players are the codeword lengths --- real numbers for arithmetic\ncodes, integers for prefix codes --- while the maximizing players are the\nuncertain source distributions. Another traditional minimizing objective is the\nfirst one considered here, maximum (average) redundancy. This problem reduces\nto an extension of an exponential Huffman objective treated in the literature\nbut heretofore without direct practical application. In addition to these, this\npaper examines the related problem of maximal minimax pointwise redundancy and\nthe problem considered by Gawrychowski and Gagie, which, for a sufficiently\nsmall relative entropy ball, is equivalent to minimax redundancy.

Previous studies of this effect have\nsuggested that it might play an important role in mixing the various phases of\nthe interstellar medium. In this paper we examine the potential effects of\nturbulent diffusion on the deuterium chemistry within molecular clouds. We find\nthat such mixing acts to reduce the efficiency of deuteration in these clouds\nby increasing the ionization fraction and reducing freeze-out of heavy\nmolecules. This leads to lower abundances for many deuterated species. We also\nexamine the influence of turbulent mixing on the transition from atomic\nhydrogen to H2 and from atomic deuterium to HD near the cloud edge.

Although several\nmechanisms have been put forward to explain this scatter, they are unable to\nfully account for the range in D/H values.

We use the most recent model for the\nelementary current operator which gives a good description of the experimental\ndata for the corresponding elementary process. The bound state wave functions\nfor the bound nucleon and hyperon are calculated within a relativistic\nmean-field model. We calculate the unpolarized triple differential cross\nsection for the hypernuclear production process e + 12C --> e + K+ +\n12_Lambda{B} as a function of the kaon scattering angle. The nuclear structure\nfunctions are calculated within a particle-hole model.

We\nextend the analysis of the extraction capabilities of the CMA when the mixing\nalso contains BPSK signals. We prove that if the various source signals do not\nshare any non zero cyclic frequency nor any non conjugate cyclic frequencies,\nthe local minima of the constant modulus cost function are separating filters.\nUnfortunately, the minimization of the Godard cost function generally fails\nwhen considering BPSK signals that have the same rates and the same carrier\nfrequencies. This failure is due to the existence of non-separating local\nminima of the Godard cost function.

This mathematical structure captures the\neffect of superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated\nintentions, which allows us to describe a variety of interesting fallacies and\nanomalies that have been reported to particularize the decision making of real\nhuman beings. The theory characterizes entangled decision making,\nnon-commutativity of subsequent decisions, and intention interference. We\ndemonstrate how the violation of the Savage's sure-thing principle, known as\nthe disjunction effect, can be explained quantitatively as a result of the\ninterference of intentions, when making decisions under uncertainty. The\ndisjunction effects, observed in experiments, are accurately predicted using a\ntheorem on interference alternation that we derive, which connects\naversion-to-uncertainty to the appearance of negative interference terms\nsuppressing the probability of actions. The conjunction fallacy is also\nexplained by the presence of the interference terms. A series of experiments\nare analysed and shown to be in excellent agreement with a priori evaluation of\ninterference effects. The conjunction fallacy is also shown to be a sufficient\ncondition for the disjunction effect and novel experiments testing the combined\ninterplay between the two effects are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 11:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-07"}

The problem is directly motivated by applications to\nstudies, such as linkage analyses and haplotype-based association projects,\ndesigned to identify genetic contributions to complex diseases. In the genetic\nstudies the relative information measures are needed for the experimental\ndesign, technology comparison, interpretation of the data, and for\nunderstanding the behavior of some of the inference tools. The central\ndifficulties in constructing such information measures arise from the multiple,\nand sometimes conflicting, aims in practice. For large samples, we show that a\nsatisfactory, likelihood-based general solution exists by using appropriate\nforms of the relative Kullback--Leibler information, and that the proposed\nmeasures are computationally inexpensive given the maximized likelihoods with\nthe observed data. Two measures are introduced, under the null and alternative\nhypothesis respectively. We exemplify the measures on data coming from mapping\nstudies on the inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. For small-sample\nproblems, which appear rather frequently in practice and sometimes in disguised\nforms (e.g., measuring individual contributions to a large study), the robust\nBayesian approach holds great promise, though the choice of a general-purpose\n\"default prior\" is a very challenging problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 13:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-15"}

In this paper, the evaluation is formulated by considering\n$N$-dimensional symplectic maps and deriving a transfer matrix formalism for\nthe stability problem. This approach makes explicit a duality relation that is\nexactly analogous to one found in a generalized Anderson tight-binding model,\nand leads to a formally exact expression for the finite-time K-S entropy.\nWithin this formalism there is a hierarchy of approximations, the final one\nbeing a diagonal approximation that only makes use of instantaneous Hessians of\nthe potential to find the K-S entropy. By way of a non-trivial illustration,\nthe K-S entropy of $N$ identically coupled kicked rotors (standard maps) is\ninvestigated. The validity of the various approximations with kicking strength,\nparticle number, and time are elucidated. An analytic formula for the K-S\nentropy within the diagonal approximation is derived and its range of validity\nis also explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 15:18:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 12:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

It is shown that the linear index\ncode based on a matrix $L$, whose column space code $C(L)$ has length $n$,\nminimum distance $d$ and dual distance $d^\\perp$, is $(d-1-t)$-block secure\n(and hence also weakly secure) if the adversary knows in advance $t \\leq d-2$\nmessages, and is completely insecure if the adversary knows in advance more\nthan $n - d$ messages.

The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for\nordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved, due\nto the large number of labeled patterns that are needed.

Unlabeled patterns, on the other hand, often exist in much greater\nabundance and are freely available. To take benefits from the abundance of\nunlabeled patterns, we present a novel transductive learning paradigm for\nordinal regression in this paper, namely Transductive Ordinal Regression (TOR).\nThe key challenge of the present study lies in the precise estimation of both\nthe ordinal class label of the unlabeled data and the decision functions of the\nordinal classes, simultaneously. The core elements of the proposed TOR include\nan objective function that caters to several commonly used loss functions\ncasted in transductive settings, for general ordinal regression. A label\nswapping scheme that facilitates a strictly monotonic decrease in the objective\nfunction value is also introduced. Extensive numerical studies on commonly used\nbenchmark datasets including the real world sentiment prediction problem are\nthen presented to showcase the characteristics and efficacies of the proposed\ntransductive ordinal regression.
