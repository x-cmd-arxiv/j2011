Our six targets were specifically\nselected because they have optical emission-line properties that are\nintermediate between starbursts and Type 2 (obscured) AGN. Our new X-ray data\nprovide an important diagnostic of the presence of an AGN. We find X-ray\nluminosities of order 10^{42} erg/s and ratios of X-ray to far-IR luminosities\nthat are higher than values in pure starburst galaxies by factors ranging from\n~ 3 to 30. This strongly suggests the presence of an AGN in at least some of\nthe galaxies. The ratios of the luminosities of the hard (2-10 keV) X-ray to [O\nIII]\\lambda 5007 emission-line are low by about an order-of-magnitude compared\nto Type 1 AGN, but are consistent with the broad range seen in Type 2 AGN.\nEither the AGN hard X-rays are significantly obscured or the [O III] emission\nis dominated by the starburst. We searched for an iron emission line at ~ 6.4\nkeV, which is a key feature of obscured AGN, but only detected emission at the\n~ 2\\sigma level. Finally, we find that the ratios of the mid-infrared (24\\mu m)\ncontinuum to [O III]\\lambda 5007 luminosities in these LBAs are higher than the\nvalues for Type 2 AGN by an average of 0.8 dex. Combining all these clues, we\nconclude that an AGN is likely to be present, but that the bolometric\nluminosity is produced primarily by an intense starburst. If these black holes\nare radiating at the Eddington limit, their masses would lie in the range of\n10^5 to 10^6 M_{sun}.

ATLAS and CMS have released their analysis with\n35~pb$^{-1}$ of data and the model class we discuss is consistent with this\ndata. It is shown that with an increase in luminosity the LSP dark matter mass\nand the gluino mass can be inferred from simple observables such as kinematic\nedges in leptonic channels and peak values in effective mass distributions.\nSpecifically, we consider cases in which the neutralino is of low mass and\nwhere the relic density consistent with WMAP observations arises via the\nexchange of Higgs bosons in unified supergravity models. The magnitudes of the\ngaugino masses are sharply limited to focused regions of the parameter space,\nand in particular the dark matter mass lies in the range $\\sim (50-65) ~\\rm\nGeV$ with an upper bound on the gluino mass of $575~{\\rm GeV}$, with a typical\nmass of $450~{\\rm GeV}$. We find that all model points in this paradigm are\ndiscoverable at the LHC at $\\sqrt s = 7 \\rm ~TeV$. We determine lower bounds on\nthe entire sparticle spectrum in this model based on existing experimental\nconstraints.

This model can be considered as an approximation of the third layer of\n3He absorbed on the surface of graphite (kagome lattice). Using dynamic\napproach we have found exact recursion relation for the partition function. For\ndifferent values of exchange parameters and temperature the diagrams of\nmagnetization are plotted and showed that magnetization properties of the model\nvary from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic depending from the value of model\nparameters. For antiferromagnetic case magnetization plateau at 1/3 of\nsaturation field is obtained. Lyapunov exponent for recursion relation are\nconsidered and showed absents of bifurcation points in thermodynamic limit. The\nYang-Lee zeros are analyzed in terms of neutral fixed points and showed that\nYang-Lee zeros of the model are located on the arcs of the circle with the\nradius R=1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2011 15:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-15"}

It provides\nscalable resources needed for the ap- plications hosted on it. As cloud-based\nservices become more dynamic, resource provisioning becomes more challenging.\nThe QoS constrained resource allocation problem is considered in this paper, in\nwhich customers are willing to host their applications on the provider's cloud\nwith a given SLA requirements for performance such as throughput and response\ntime. Since, the data centers hosting the applications consume huge amounts of\nenergy and cause huge operational costs, solutions that reduce energy\nconsumption as well as operational costs are gaining importance. In this work,\nwe propose an energy efficient mechanism that allocates the cloud resources to\nthe applications without violating the given service level agreements(SLA)\nusing Ant colony framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2011 15:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-15"}

Each node in the social\nnetwork may be an expert in one or more skills. Edge weights specify affinity\nor collaborative compatibility between respective nodes. Given a project that\nrequires a set of specified number of skilled individuals in each area of\nexpertise, the goal is to identify a team that maximizes the collaborative\ncompatibility. For example, the requirement may be to form a team that has at\nleast three databases experts and at least two theory experts. We explore team\nformation where the collaborative compatibility objective is measured as the\ndensity of the induced subgraph on selected nodes. The problem of maximizing\ndensity is NP-hard even when the team requires individuals of only one skill.\nWe present a 3-approximation algorithm that improves upon a naive extension of\nthe previously known algorithm for densest at least $k$ subgraph problem. We\nfurther show how the same approximation can be extended to a special case of\nmultiple skills. Our problem generalizes the formulation studied by Lappas et\nal. [KDD '09] who measure team compatibility in terms of diameter or spanning\ntree costs. Experiments are performed on a crawl of the DBLP graph where\nindividuals can be skilled in at most four areas - theory, databases, data\nmining, and artificial intelligence. In addition to our main algorithm, we also\npresent heuristic extensions to trade off between the size of the solution and\nits induced density. These density-based algorithms outperform the\ndiameter-based objective on several metrics for assessing the collaborative\ncompatibility of teams. The solutions suggested are also intuitively meaningful\nand scale well with the increase in the number of skilled individuals required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2011 02:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-17"}

The system\ncan be modelled by a sine-Gordon equation with a piecewise-constant function to\nrepresent the varying Josephson tunneling critical current. The existence of\npinned fluxons depends on the length of the inhomogeneity, the variation in the\nJosephson tunneling critical current and the applied bias current. We establish\nthat a system may either not be able to sustain a pinned fluxon, or - for\ninstance by varying the length of the inhomogeneity - may exhibit various\ndifferent types of pinned fluxons. Our stability analysis shows that changes of\nstability can only occur at critical points of the length of the inhomogeneity\nas a function of the (Hamiltonian) energy density inside the inhomogeneity - a\nrelation we determine explicitly. In combination with continuation arguments\nand Sturm-Liouville theory, we determine the stability of all constructed\npinned fluxons. It follows that if a given system is able to sustain at least\none pinned fluxon, there is exactly one stable pinned fluxon, i.e. the system\nselects one unique stable pinned configuration. Moreover, it is shown that both\nfor microresistors and microresonators this stable pinned configuration may be\nnon-monotonic - something which is not possible in the homogeneous case.\nFinally, it is shown that results in the literature on localised\ninhomogeneities can be recovered as limits of our results on microresonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2011 15:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-17"}
