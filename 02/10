In this work we study its spectral and timing\nproperties during the 2009 outburst based on Swift and RXTE data. Our spectral\nanalysis of the source indicates only slight spectral shape evolution during\nthe entire outburst. The equivalent width of the iron line and the apparent\narea of the blackbody emission associated with the hotspot at the stellar\nsurface both decrease significantly during the outburst. This is consistent\nwith a gradual receding of the accretion disc as the accretion rate drops. The\npulse profile analysis shows absence of dramatic shape evolution with a\nmoderate decrease in pulse amplitude. This behaviour might result from a\nmovement of the accretion column footprint towards the magnetic pole as the\ndisc retreats. The time lag between the soft and the hard energy pulses\nincrease by a factor of two during the outburst. A physical displacement of the\ncentroid of the accretion shock relative to the blackbody spot or changes in\nthe emissivity pattern of the Comptonization component related to the\nvariations of the accretion column structure could cause this evolution. We\nhave found that IGR J17511-3057 demonstrates outburst stages similar to those\nseen in SAX J1808.4-3658. A transition from the \"slow decay\" into the \"rapid\ndrop\" stage, associated with the dramatic flux decrease, is also accompanied by\na pulse phase shift which could result from an appearance of the secondary spot\ndue to the increasing inner disc radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 17:10:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 10:12:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 10:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 08:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Recently, however,\nseveral measurement procedures have been proposed in which the Heisenberg limit\nseemed to be surpassed. This led to an extensive debate over the question how\nthe sensitivity scales with the physical resources and the computational\nresources that are used in estimation procedures. Here, we reconcile the\nphysical definition of the relevant resources with the information-theoretical\nscaling in terms of the query complexity of a quantum network. This leads to a\nnovel and ultimate Heisenberg limit that applies to all conceivable measurement\nprocedures. The second result reveals a close relationship between quantum\nmetrology and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm over continuous-variable quantum\nsystems. Here, we develop a general procedure, characterized by two parameters,\nthat unifies parameter estimation and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. The\nprocedure estimates a value of an unknown parameter with Heisenberg-limited\nprecision or solves the Deutsch-Jozsa problem in a single run without the use\nof any entanglement. The third result illustrates how physical principles that\ngovern interaction of light and matter can be efficiently employed to create a\ncomputational resource for a (one-way) quantum computer. More specifically, we\ndemonstrate theoretically a scheme based on atomic ensembles and the dipole\nblockade mechanism for generation of the so-called cluster states in a single\nstep. This procedure is significantly more efficient than any known robust\nprobabilistic entangling operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 17:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

On the basis of\nzeta function regularisation, the vacuum energy of the arrangement is finite\nfor conformal propagation in space-time. For even spheres this energy is\nindependent of the angle of the lune. For odd dimensions it is shown that for\nall Neumann, or all Dirichlet, boundary conditions the piston is attracted or\nrepelled by the nearest wall if d=3,7,... or if d=1,5,..., respectively. For\nhybrid N-D conditions these requirements are switched. If a mass is added,\ndivergences arise which render the model suspect. The analysis, however, is\nrelatively straightforward and involves the Barnes zeta function. The extension\nto finite temperatures is made and it is shown that for the 3,7,... series of\nodd spheres, the repulsion by the walls continues but that, above a certain\ntemperature, the free energy acquires two minima symmetrically placed about the\nmid point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 19:22:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 19:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-11"}

Abundance anomalies have been observed in field sdB stars and in\nnearly all Horizontal Branch (HB) stars of globular clusters with Teff > 11\n000K whatever be the cluster metallicity. Aims. The aim is to determine the\nabundance variations to be expected in sdB stars and in HB stars of\nmetallicities Z \\geq 0.0001 and what observed abundances teach us about\nhydrodynamical processes competing with atomic diffusion. Methods. Complete\nstellar evolution models, including the effects of atomic diffusion and\nradiative acceleration, have been computed from the zero age main-sequence for\nmetallicities of Z0 = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.004 and 0.02. On the HB the masses were\nselected to cover the Teff interval from 7000 to 37000K. Some 60 evolutionary\nHB models were calculated. The calculations of surface abundance anomalies\nduring the horizontal branch depend on one parameter, the surface mixed mass.\nResults. For sdB stars with Teff < 37000K and for HB stars with Teff > 11 000K\nin all observed clusters, independent of metallicity, it was found that most\nobserved abundance anomalies (even up to ~ x 200) were compatible, within error\nbars, with expected abundances. A mixed mass of ~1.E-7 M\\odot was determined by\ncomparison with observations. Conclusions. Observations of globular cluster HB\nstars with Teff > 11 000K and of sdB stars with Teff < 37 000K suggest that\nmost observed abundance anomalies can be explained by element separation driven\nby radiative acceleration occuring at a mass fraction of ~1.E-7 M\\odot.

The system consists of two medium-band\nfilters in the K-band region of the near-infrared, which are sensitive to water\nice and methane ice, plus continuum observations in the J-band and Y-band. The\nprimary purpose of this system is to distinguish between three basic types of\nKuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) --- those rich in water ice, those rich in methane\nice, and those with little absorbance. In this work, we present\nproof-of-concept observations of 51 KBOs using our filter system, 21 of which\nhave never been observed in the near-IR spectroscopically. We show that our\ncustom photometric system is consistent with previous spectroscopic\nobservations while reducing telescope observing time by a factor of 3.

We add 2009 YE7 to the Haumea\ncollisional family based on our water ice band observations(J-H2O = -1.03 +/-\n0.27) which indicate a high amount of water ice absorption, our calculated\nproper orbital elements, and the neutral optical colors we measured, V-R = 0.38\n+/- 0.04, which are all consistent with the rest of the Haumea family. We\nidentify several objects dynamically similar to Haumea as being distinct from\nthe Haumea family as they do not have water ice on their surfaces.

The detection frequency of Halpha\nemission is shown to be only weakly dependent on the total mass of the system,\nat the 52% confidence level. In contrast, we find that the presence of Halpha\nfilaments is strongly correlated with both the global (89% confidence level)\nand core (84%) ICM entropy, as well as the X-ray cooling rate (72%). The Halpha\nfilaments are therefore an excellent proxy for the cooling ICM. The Halpha\nfilaments are more strongly correlated with the cooling properties of the ICM\nthan with the radio properties of the BCG; this further supports the scenario\nwhere these filaments are directly associated with a thermally-unstable,\nrapidly cooling ICM, rather than radio bubbles.

As a demonstration, we apply this model to new\nobservations made with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space\nTelescope of the IGM absorbers at z~0.1877 along the 1ES 1553+113 sight line.\nWe identify Ly alpha, C III, O VI, and N V absorption lines with two distinct\nvelocity components (blue at z_b=0.18757; red at z_r=0.18772) separated by\nDelta(cz)/(1+z)~38 km/s. Joint analyses of these lines indicate that none of\nthe examined ionization scenarios can be applied with confidence to the blue\nvelocity component, although photoionization seems to play a dominant role.

We showed recently[1] that the naked singularities that form due\nto gravitational collapse of massive stars provide a suitable environment where\nparticles could get accelerated and collide at arbitrarily high center of mass\nenergies. However, we focussed there only on the spherically symmetric\ngravitational collapse models, which were also assumed to be self-similar. In\nthis paper, we broaden and generalize the result to all gravitational collapse\nmodels leading to the formation of a naked singularity as final state of\ncollapse, evolving from a regular initial data, without making any prior\nrestrictive assumptions about the spacetime symmetries such as above. We show\nthat when the particles interact and collide near the Cauchy horizon, the\nenergy of collision in the center of mass frame will be arbitrarily high, thus\noffering a window to the Planck scale physics. We also consider the issue of\nvarious possible physical mechanisms of generation of such very high energy\nparticles from the vicinity of naked singularity. We then construct a model of\ngravitational collapse to a timelike naked singularity to demonstrate the\nworking of these ideas, where the pressure is allowed to be negative but the\nenergy conditions are respected. We show that a finite amount of mass-energy\ndensity has to be necessarily radiated away from the vicinity of the naked\nsingularity as the collapse evolves. Therefore the nature of naked\nsingularities, both at classical and quantum level could play an important role\nin the process of particle acceleration, explaining the occurrence of highly\nenergetic outgoing particles in the vicinity of Cauchy horizon that participate\nin extreme high energy collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 03:46:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 14:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

Parameter perturbations on the right-hand side of the inequalities are\nrequired to be merely bounded, and thus the natural parameter space is\n$l_{\\infty}(J)$. Our basic strategy consists of linearizing the parameterized\nconvex system via splitting convex inequalities into linear ones by using the\nFenchel-Legendre conjugate. This approach yields that arbitrary bounded\nright-hand side perturbations of the convex system turn on constant-by-blocks\nperturbations in the linearized system. Based on advanced variational analysis,\nwe derive a precise formula for computing the exact Lipschitzian bound of the\nfeasible solution map of block-perturbed linear systems, which involves only\nthe system's data, and then show that this exact bound agrees with the\ncoderivative norm of the aforementioned mapping.

Since binary frequencies in the birth places of stars,\nyoung embedded clusters, are sometimes even higher than on average the question\narises of how binary stars form in young dense star clusters and how their\nproperties evolve to those observed in the field population.\n  Aims: We assess, the influence of stellar dynamical interactions on the\nprimordial binary population in young dense cluster environments.\n  Methods: We perform numerical N-body simulations of the Orion Nebula Cluster\nlike star cluster models including primordial binary populations using the\nsimulation code nbody6++.\n  Results: We find two remarkable results that have yet not been reported: The\nfirst is that the evolution of the binary frequency in young dense star\nclusters is independent predictably of its initial value. The time evolution of\nthe normalized number of binary systems has a fundamental shape. The second\nmain result is that the mass of the primary star is of vital importance to the\nevolution of the binary. The more massive a primary star, the lower the\nprobability that the binary is destroyed by gravitational interactions. This\nresults in a higher binary frequency for stars more massive than $2\\Msun$\ncompared to the binary frequency of lower mass stars. The observed increase in\nthe binary frequency with primary mass is therefore most likely not due to\ndifferences in the formation process but can be entirely explained as a\ndynamical effect.\n  Conclusions: Our results allow us to draw conclusions about the past and the\nfuture number of binary systems in young dense star clusters and demonstrate\nthat the present field stellar population has been influenced significantly by\nits natal environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 08:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

This phenomenon is most strongly\nmanifested when observables are related to mutually unbiased bases. In this\npaper, we shed some light on the connection between mutually unbiased bases and\nanother essential feature of quantum mechanics, quantum entanglement. It is\nshown that a complete set of mutually unbiased bases of a bipartite system\ncontains a fixed amount of entanglement, independently of the choice of the\nset. This has implications for entanglement distribution among the states of a\ncomplete set. In prime-squared dimensions we present an explicit\nexperiment-friendly construction of a complete set with a particularly simple\nentanglement distribution. Finally, we describe basic properties of mutually\nunbiased bases composed only of product states. The constructions are\nillustrated with explicit examples in low dimensions. We believe that\nproperties of entanglement in mutually unbiased bases might be one of the\ningredients to be taken into account to settle the question of the existence of\ncomplete sets.

This study indicates a strategy to\nbuild large surveys of clusters whose identification and redshift measurement\nare both based on X-ray data alone. We apply a blind search for K--shell and\nL--shell Fe line complex in X-ray cluster spectra using Chandra archival\nobservations of galaxy clusters.

The $\\Delta C_{stat}$ provides the most efficient means for discarding\nwrong redshift measures and to estimate the actual error on $z_X$.

The size distribution of media events follows a Gutenberg-Richter\nlaw, the dynamics of media attention before and after the media event follows\nOmori's law. We present further empirical evidence that for media events of\nendogenous origin the overall public reception of the event is correlated with\nthe behavior of word frequencies at the beginning of the event, and is to a\ncertain degree predictable. These results may imply that the process of opinion\nformation in a human society might be related to effects known from excitable\nmedia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 12:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The central parameter of\nresource-bounded measure is the {\\it resource bound} $\\Delta$, which is a class\nof functions. When $\\Delta$ is unrestricted, i.e., contains all functions with\nthe specified domains and codomains, resource-bounded measure coincides with\nclassical Lebesgue measure. On the other hand, when $\\Delta$ contains functions\nsatisfying some complexity constraint, resource-bounded measure imposes\ninternal measure structure on a corresponding complexity class.\n  Most applications of resource-bounded measure use only the\n\"measure-zero/measure-one fragment\" of the theory. For this fragment, $\\Delta$\ncan be taken to be a class of type-one functions (e.g., from strings to\nrationals). However, in the full theory of resource-bounded measurability and\nmeasure, the resource bound $\\Delta$ also contains type-two functionals. To\ndate, both the full theory and its zero-one fragment have been developed in\nterms of a list of example resource bounds chosen for their apparent utility.\n  This paper replaces this list-of-examples approach with a careful\ninvestigation of the conditions that suffice for a class $\\Delta$ to be a\nresource bound.

Using\nboth monthly and weekly data, we found very similar lead-lag dependence between\nthe S&P500 stock market index and the yields of bonds inside two groups: bond\nyields of short-term maturities (Federal funds rate (FFR), 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, and\n3Y) and bond yields of long-term maturities (5Y, 7Y, 10Y, and 20Y).

Yet,\nindependent of either the force density or the droplet size, the center-of-mass\nvelocity is found to be linear in terms of the inverse of dynamic viscosity.

The modified Einstein's field equations have been solved by applying\nvariation law for Hubble's parameter. This law generates two type of solutions\nfor average scale factor, one is of power law type and other is of exponential\nlaw type. The power law describes the dynamics of Universe from big bang to\npresent epoch while exponential law seems reasonable to project dynamics of\nfuture Universe. It has been found that the displacement actor $(\\beta)$ is a\ndecreasing function of time and it approaches to small positive value at late\ntime, which is collaborated with Halford (1970) as well as recent observations\nof SN Ia. The study reveals that massive strings dominate in early Universe and\neventually disappear from Universe for sufficiently large time, which is in\nagreement with the current astronomical observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 16:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

At any order $a^n$, we\nevaluate the complete contributions to the energy per particle $\\bar E(k_f)$\narising from combined (multiple) particle-particle and hole-hole rescatterings\nin the medium. This novel result is achieved by simply decomposing the\nparticle-hole propagator into the vacuum propagator plus a medium-insertion and\ncorrecting for certain symmetry factors in the $(n-1)$-th power of the\nin-medium loop. Known results for the low-density expansion up to and including\norder $a^4$ are accurately reproduced. The emerging series in $a k_f$ can be\nsummed to all orders in the form of a double-integral over an arctangent\nfunction. In that representation the unitary limit $a\\to \\infty$ can be taken\nand one obtains the value $\\xi= 0.5067$ for the universal Bertsch parameter. We\ndiscuss also applications to the equation of state of neutron matter at low\ndensities and mention further extensions of the resummation method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 15:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Total Fluorescence Yield (TFY) X-ray absorption\nexperiments show that oxygen incorporation changes the initial Fe valence state\nin both the initially grown FeTe and FeSe films to mainly Fe3+ in the oxygen\nincorporated films. In contrast we observe that while Te moves to a mixed\nTe0/Te4+ valence state, the Se always remains Se0. This work highlights how\ndifferent responses of the electronic structure by the respective chalcogenides\nto oxidation could be related to the mechanisms which are inducing\nsuperconductivity in FeTe and quenching superconductivity in FeSe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 15:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
