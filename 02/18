Recall that the girth is the\nlength of the smallest cycle, so that maps of girth at least $d=1,2,3$ are\nrespectively the general, loopless, and simple maps. For each positive integer\n$d$, we obtain a bijection for the class of plane maps (maps with one\ndistinguished root-face) of girth $d$ having a root-face of degree $d$. We then\nobtain more general bijective constructions for annular maps (maps with two\ndistinguished root-faces) of girth at least $d$. Our bijections associate to\neach map a decorated plane tree, and non-root faces of degree $k$ of the map\ncorrespond to vertices of degree $k$ of the tree. As special cases we recover\nseveral known bijections for bipartite maps, loopless triangulations, simple\ntriangulations, simple quadrangulations, etc. Our work unifies and greatly\nextends these bijective constructions. In terms of counting, we obtain for each\ninteger $d$ an expression for the generating function\n$F_d(x_d,x_{d+1},x_{d+2},...)$ of plane maps of girth $d$ with root-face of\ndegree $d$, where the variable $x_k$ counts the non-root faces of degree $k$.\nThe expression for $F_1$ was already obtained bijectively by Bouttier, Di\nFrancesco and Guitter, but for $d\\geq 2$ the expression of $F_d$ is new.

Measurements of the form factor are\nmade using the technique of partially twisted boundary condition to reach small\nmomentum transfer as well as periodic boundary condition with integer momenta.\nAdditional improvements including random wall source techniques and a judicious\nchoice of momenta carried by the incoming and outgoing quarks are employed for\nerror reduction. Analyzing the form factor data for the pion mass at $M_\\pi\n\\approx 411$ MeV and 296 MeV, we find that the NNLO SU(2) chiral perturbation\ntheory fit yields $<r^2>=0.441 \\pm 0.046 {\\rm fm}^2$ for the pion charge radius\nat the physical pion mass.

In\nthis paper, I address these issues using a new framework. The central result is\nthat a person is 'minimally' conscious if and only if he knows at least one\ntruth. This lets us move away from the vagueness surrounding consciousness and\ninstead focus equivalently on: (i) what truths are and how our brain\nrepresents/relates them to each other and (ii) how we attain a feeling of\nknowing for a truth. For the former problem, since truths are things that do\nnot change, I replace the abstract notion with a dynamical one called fixed\nsets. These sets are guaranteed to exist for our brain and other stable\nparallel looped systems. The relationships between everyday events are now\nbuilt using relationships between fixed sets, until our brain creates a unique\ndynamical state called the self-sustaining threshold 'membrane' of fixed sets.\nFor the latter problem, I present necessary and sufficient conditions for\nattaining a feeling of knowing using a definition of continuity applied to\nabstractions. Combining these results, I now say that a person is minimally\nconscious if and only if his brain has a self-sustaining dynamical membrane\nwith abstract continuous paths.

I argue that the standard\ninterpretations of the Wright-Fisher controversy do not accurately represent\nthe ideas and arguments of these two key historical figures. The usual account\ncontrasts the major slogans attached to each name: Wright's adaptive landscape\nand shifting balance theory of evolution versus Fisher's fundamental theorem of\nnatural selection. These alternative theories are in fact incommensurable.\nWright's theory is a detailed dynamical model of evolutionary change in actual\npopulations. Fisher's theory is an abstract invariance and conservation law\nthat, like all physical laws, captures essential features of a system but does\nnot account for all aspects of dynamics in real examples. This key contrast\nbetween embodied theories of real cases and abstract laws is missing from prior\nanalyses of Wright versus Fisher. They never argued about this contrast.\nInstead, the issue at stake in their arguments concerned the actual dynamics of\nreal populations. Both agreed that fluctuations of nonadditive (epistatic) gene\ncombinations play a central role in evolution. Wright emphasized stochastic\nfluctuations of gene combinations in small, isolated populations. By contrast,\nFisher believed that fluctuating selection in large populations was the main\ncause of fluctuation in nonadditive gene combinations. Close reading shows that\nwidely cited views attributed to Fisher mostly come from what Wright said about\nFisher, whereas Fisher's own writings clearly do not support such views.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 21:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-21"}

Previously cited laboratory experiments\nin supporting this hypothesis were performed either in a different type of flow\nthan Keplerian or without quantitative measurements of angular momentum\ntransport and mean flow profile, and all of them appear to suffer from Ekman\neffects, secondary flows induced by nonoptimal axial boundary conditions.

Aims: To\nquantify angular momentum transport due to subcritical hydrodynamic turbulence,\nif exists, in a quasi-Keplerian flow with minimized Ekman effects. Methods: We\nperform a local measurement of the azimuthal--radial component of the Reynolds\nstress tensor in a novel laboratory apparatus where Ekman effects are minimized\nby flexible control of axial boundary conditions.

It turns out in this framework that Z_4 is\nindeed the minimal discrete symmetry and its implementation requires the\nintroduction of at least two Higgs quintets, which leads to a two Higgs doublet\nmodel at low energy scale.

The bandwidth puzzle guarantees that if the\nadversaries can solve the puzzle, they must have spent substantial bandwidth,\nthe size of which is comparable to the size of the contents they claim to have\nuploaded for each other. Therefore, the puzzle discourages the collusion. In\nthis paper, we study the performance of the bandwidth puzzle and give a lower\nbound on the average number of bits the adversaries must receive to be able to\nsolve the puzzles with a certain probability. We show that our bound is tight\nin the sense that there exists a strategy to approach this lower bound\nasymptotically within a small factor. The new bound gives better security\nguarantees than the existing bound, and can be used to guide better choices of\npuzzle parameters to improve the system performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 03:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-21"}

With the next generation of radio\ninterferometers being planned and built, there is great potential for detecting\nand studying large samples of radio transients. Currently-used image-based\ntechniques for detecting radio sources have not been demonstrated to be\noptimal, and there is a need for development of more sophisticated algorithms,\nand methodology for comparing different detection techniques. A\nvisibility-space detector benefits from our good understanding of\nvisibility-space noise properties, and does not suffer from the image artifacts\nand need for deconvolution in image-space detectors. In this paper, we propose\na method for designing optimal source detectors using visibility data, building\non statistical decision theory. The approach is substantially different to\nconventional radio astronomy source detection. Optimal detection requires an\naccurate model for the data, and we present a realistic model for the\nlikelihood function of radio interferometric data, including the effects of\ncalibration, signal confusion and atmospheric phase fluctuations. As part of\nthis process, we derive fundamental limits on the calibration of an\ninterferometric array, including the case where many relatively weak \"in-beam\"\ncalibrators are used. These limits are then applied, along with a model for\natmospheric phase fluctuations, to determine the limits on measuring source\nposition, flux density and spectral index, in the general case. We then present\nan optimal visibility-space detector using realistic models for an\ninterferometer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 03:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

However, we know the actual size and reward only when the job\ncompletes. How should we schedule jobs to maximize the expected total reward?\nWe know O(1)-approximations when we assume that (i) rewards and sizes are\nindependent random variables, and (ii) we cannot prematurely cancel jobs. What\ncan we say when either or both of these assumptions are changed?\n  The stochastic knapsack problem is of interest in its own right, but\ntechniques developed for it are applicable to other stochastic packing\nproblems. Indeed, ideas for this problem have been useful for budgeted learning\nproblems, where one is given several arms which evolve in a specified\nstochastic fashion with each pull, and the goal is to pull the arms a total of\nB times to maximize the reward obtained. Much recent work on this problem focus\non the case when the evolution of the arms follows a martingale, i.e., when the\nexpected reward from the future is the same as the reward at the current state.\nWhat can we say when the rewards do not form a martingale?\n  In this paper, we give constant-factor approximation algorithms for the\nstochastic knapsack problem with correlations and/or cancellations, and also\nfor budgeted learning problems where the martingale condition is not satisfied.\nIndeed, we can show that previously proposed LP relaxations have large\nintegrality gaps. We propose new time-indexed LP relaxations, and convert the\nfractional solutions into distributions over strategies, and then use the LP\nvalues and the time ordering information from these strategies to devise a\nrandomized adaptive scheduling algorithm. We hope our LP formulation and\ndecomposition methods may provide a new way to address other correlated bandit\nproblems with more general contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 04:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-21"}

These occur at variable and unpredictable intervals,\nand are followed by an optical decline over several weeks, and activity from\nthe X-ray to the radio. The unpredictability of recurrent novae and related\nstellar types can hamper systematic study of their outbursts. Here we analyse\nthe long-term lightcurve of RS Ophiuchi, a recurrent nova with six confirmed\noutbursts, most recently in 2006 February. We confirm the previously suspected\n1945 outburst, largely obscured in a seasonal gap. We also find a signal via\nwavelet analysis that can be used to predict an incipient outburst up to a few\nhundred days before hand. This has never before been possible. In addition this\nmay suggest that the preferred thermonuclear runaway mechanism for the\noutbursts will have to be modified, as no pre-outburst signal is anticipated in\nthat case. If our result indeed points to gaps in our understanding of how\noutbursts are driven, we will need to study such objects carefully to determine\nif the white dwarf is growing in mass, an essential factor if these systems are\nto become Type Ia Supernovae.

Thermal (Brownian) noise in\nthese coatings produce excess phase noise which can seriously degrade the\nsensitivity of high-precision measurements with these cavities, in particular\nin laser gravitational-wave antennas (for example project LIGO), where at the\ncurrent stage it is one of the main limiting factors. We present a method to\ncalculate this effect accurately and analyze different strategies to diminish\nit by optimizing the coating. Traditionally this noise is calculated as if the\nbeam is reflected from the surface of the mirror fluctuating due to the sums of\nthe fluctuations of each layer. However the beam in fact penetrates a coating\nand Brownian expansion of the layers leads to dephasing of interference in the\ncoating and consequently to additional change in reflected phase. Fluctuations\nin the thickness of a layer change the strain in the medium and hence due to\nphotoelastic effect change the refractive index of this layer. This additional\neffect should be also considered. It is possible to make the noise smaller\npreserving the reflectivity by changing the total number of layers and\nthicknesses of high and low refractive ones. We show how this optimized coating\nmay be constructed analytically rather then numerically as before. We also\ncheck the possibility to use internal resonant layers and optimized cap layer\nto decrease the thermal noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 09:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-08"}

In this study, we\ncheck both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects missed previously.

Indeed, the (2{\\times}2)C reconstruction, with a Si\nadatom and C restatom structure, efficiently passivates the SiC(0001) surface\nthanks to an adatom/restatom charge transfer mechanism.

Native\ninterface defects are therefore likely to play an important role in the doping\nmechanism on the C terminated SiC substrates.

It is also known that the use of conventional\nrelays, which introduce a processing delay of at least one symbol duration\nrelative to the direct paths between sources and destinations, does not\nincrease the DoF of the 2 user interference channel. The use of instantaneous\nrelays (relays-without-delay) has been explored for the single user\npoint-to-point setting and it is known that such a relay, even with memoryless\nforwarding at the relay, can achieve a higher capacity than conventional\nrelays. In this work, we show that the 2 user interference channel with an\ninstantaneous relay, achieves 3/2 DoF. Thus, an instantaneous relay increases\nnot only the capacity but also the DoF of the 2 user interference channel. The\nachievable scheme is inspired by the aligned interference neutralization scheme\nrecently proposed for the 2X2X2 interference channel. Remarkably the DoF gain\nis achieved with memoryless relays, i.e., with relays that have no memory of\npast received symbols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 13:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-21"}

The model describes the co-evolution of the mass\nfunction of gravitationally bound cores and of the IMF in a protocluster clump.\nDense cores are generated uniformly in time at different locations in the\nclump, and contract over lifetimes that are a few times their free fall times.\nThe cores collapse to form stars that power strong stellar winds whose\ncumulative kinetic energy evacuates the gas from the clump and quenches further\ncore and star formation. This sets the final star formation efficiency, SFEf.\nModels are run with various metallicities in the range Z/Zsol=[0.1,2]. We find\nthat the SFEf decreases strongly with increasing metallicity.The\nSFEf-metallicity relation is well described by a decaying exponential whose\nexact parameters depend weakly on the value of the core formation efficiency.\nWe find that there is almost no dependence of the SFEf-metallicity relation on\nthe clump mass.

The spatial distribution of the methanol is\nstudied by mapping line emission, as well as the column density and excitation\ntemperature, which are estimated using rotation diagrams. For a limited number\nof positions the parameters are checked with non-LTE models. Furthermore, the\ndistribution of the methanol abundance is derived in comparison with archival\ndust continuum maps. Methanol is detected over a 0.3x0.15 pc area centred on\nthe Cep A HW2 source, showing an outflow signature. Most of the gas can be\ncharacterized by a moderately warm rotation temperature (30-60K). At the\ncentral position two velocity components are detected with different excitation\ncharacteristics, the first related to the large-scale outflow. The second\ncomponent, uniquely detected at the central location, is probably associated\nwith the maser emission on much smaller scales of 2\". Detailed analysis reveals\nthat the highest densities and temperatures occur for these inner components.\nIn the inner region the dust and gas are shown to have different physical\nparameters.

The geometry of the\nlarge-scale methanol is in accordance with previous determinations of the Cep A\ngeometry, in particular those from methanol masers.

Currently much work is spent on receivers which break up this\nseparation, e.g., by enhancing channel estimation based on reliability\ninformation on the data symbols. In the present work, we evaluate the possible\ngain of a joint processing of data and pilot symbols in comparison to the case\nof a separate processing in the context of stationary Rayleigh flat-fading\nchannels. Therefore, we discuss the nature of the possible gain of a joint\nprocessing of pilot and data symbols. We show that the additional information\nthat can be gained by a joint processing is captured in the temporal\ncorrelation of the channel estimation error of the solely pilot based channel\nestimation, which is not retrieved by the channel decoder in case of separate\nprocessing. In addition, we derive a new lower bound on the achievable rate for\njoint processing of pilot and data symbols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 15:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-21"}

A generalized lens theorem provides us\nwith a class of spatially varying slab lenses satisfying the prerequisite\nsymmetries to fold the optical space onto itself. This theorem can be derived\nusing powerful tools of transformational optics. A paradigm of such\ncomplementary media are checkerboards consisting of alternating cells of\npositive and negative refractive index that represent a very singular situation\nin which the local density of modes at the corners are enormously enhanced. We\nhave considered several theoretical and numerical aspects of such structured\nfilms including a finite slabs of multi-scale checkerboards of NRIM satisfying\nthe generalized lens theorem which are host of strongly enhanced\nelectromagnetic feld. Such checkerboards can be mapped using transformational\noptics onto three-dimensional corner lenses consisting of semi-infinite\nheterogeneous anisotropic regions of space satisfying the generalized lens\ntheorem. It is also possible to design three-dimensional checkerboards of\ncomplementary media, the only restriction being that corresponding unfolded\nstructures in the plane are constrained by the four color theorem. Some of\nthese meta-surfaces in the plane display thin bridges of complementary media,\nand this further enhances their plasmonic response. Since plasmonic metals\nmimic the behaviour of NRIM at small length scales, opaque gold films\nstructured at sub-micron scales in a checkerboard fashion were fabricated using\nfocussed-ion-beam technologies and their scattering spectra measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 15:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-21"}
