Hence, as soon as a given node experiences a reception rate, for\nmessages coming from a given peer, which is lower than expected, it can send a\nstimulus to the neighbor that usually forwards these messages, asking it to\nincrease its dissemination probability. Three variants of this approach will be\nstudied.

It is written in Fortran 95/2003 and has been parallelised using\nOpenMP. SEREN is designed in a flexible, modular style, thereby allowing a\nlarge number of options to be selected or disabled easily and without\ncompromising performance. SEREN uses the conservative `grad-h' formulation of\nSPH, but can easily be configured to use traditional SPH or Godunov SPH.\nThermal physics is treated either with a barotropic equation of state, or by\nsolving the energy equation and modelling the transport of cooling radiation. A\nBarnes-Hut tree is used to obtain neighbour lists and compute gravitational\naccelerations efficiently, and an hierarchical time-stepping scheme is used to\nreduce the number of computations per timestep. Dense gravitationally bound\nobjects are replaced by sink particles, to allow the simulation to be evolved\nlonger, and to facilitate the identification of protostars and the compilation\nof stellar and binary properties. At the termination of a hydrodynamical\nsimulation, SEREN has the option of switching to a pure N-body simulation,\nusing a 4th-order Hermite integrator, and following the ballistic evolution of\nthe sink particles (e.g. to determine the final binary statistics once a star\ncluster has relaxed).

Understanding\nthis component is crucial as it provides a background to many different signals\nsuch as extragalactic sources or annihilating dark matter. It is timely to\nreinvestigate how it is calculated and to assess the various uncertainties\nwhich are likely to affect the accuracy of the predictions. The Galactic\ngamma-ray diffuse emission is mostly produced above a few GeV by the\ninteractions of cosmic ray primaries impinging on the interstellar material.\nThe theoretical error on that component is derived by exploring various\npotential sources of uncertainty. Particular attention is paid to cosmic ray\npropagation. Nuclear cross sections, the proton and helium fluxes at the Earth,\nthe Galactic radial profile of supernova remnants and the hydrogen distribution\ncan also severely affect the signal. The propagation of cosmic ray species\nthroughout the Galaxy is described in the framework of a semi-analytic two-zone\ndiffusion/convection model. This allows to convert the constraints set by the\nboron-to-carbon data into a theoretical uncertainty on the diffuse emission.\nNew deconvolutions of the HI and CO sky maps are also used to get the hydrogen\ndistribution within the Galaxy. The thickness of the cosmic ray diffusive halo\nis found to have a significant effect on the Galactic gamma-ray diffuse\nemission while the interplay between diffusion and convection has little\ninfluence on the signal. The uncertainties related to nuclear cross sections\nand to the primary cosmic ray fluxes at the Earth are significant. The radial\ndistribution of supernova remnants along the Galactic plane turns out to be a\nkey ingredient. As expected, the predictions are extremely sensitive to the\nspatial distribution of hydrogen within the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 18:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 08:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Interpreting the\n$q$-Fock space as an algebra of \"random variables\" exhibiting a specific\ncommutativity structure, one can construct the so-called $q$-semicircular and\n$q$-circular operators acting as $q$-deformations of the classical Gaussian and\ncomplex Gaussian random variables, respectively. While the $q$-semicircular\noperator is generally well understood, many basic properties of the\n$q$-circular operator (in particular, a tractable expression for its norm)\nremain elusive. Inspired by the combinatorial approach to free probability, we\nrevist the combinatorial formulations of these operators. We point out that a\nfinite alternating-sum expression for $2n$-norm of the $q$-semicircular is\navailable via generating functions of chord-crossing diagrams developed by\nTouchard in the 1950s and distilled by Riordan in 1974.

In contrast, the $2n$-norms of the $q$-circular are encoded by\nchord-crossing diagrams that are parity-reversing, which have not yet been\ncharacterized in the combinatorial literature. We derive certain combinatorial\nproperties of these objects, including closed-form expressions for the number\nof such diagrams of any size with up to eleven crossings.

Source and relay are connected via two\nunidirectional out-of-band orthogonal links of finite capacity, and a\nstate-dependent memoryless channel connects source and relay, on one side, and\nthe destination, on the other. Via the orthogonal links, the source can convey\ninformation about the message to be delivered to the destination to the relay\nwhile the relay can forward state information to the source. This exchange\nenables cooperation between source and relay on both transmission of message\nand state information to the destination. First, an achievable scheme, inspired\nby noisy network coding, is proposed that exploits both message and state\ncooperation. Next, based on the given achievable rate and appropriate upper\nbounds, capacity results are identified for some special cases.

In this paper we use replica trick methods, as\nwell as results from enumerative combinatorics, to prove that web mixing\nmatrices are always: (a) idempotent, thus acting as projection operators; and\n(b) have zero sum rows: the elements in each row in these matrices sum up to\nzero, thus removing components that are symmetric under permutation of gluon\nattachments. Furthermore, in webs containing both planar and non-planar\ndiagrams we show that the zero sum property holds separately for these two\nsets. The properties we establish here are completely general and form an\nimportant step in elucidating the structure of exponentiation in non-Abelian\ngauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 19:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

Nitrogen surface abundances for a\nlarge and homogeneous sample of massive B-type stars in the LMC were obtained\nby the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars. This sample is the first covering a\nbroad range of projected stellar rotational velocities, with a large enough\nsample of high quality data to allow for a statistically significant analysis.\nWe use the sample to provide the first rigorous test of the theory of\nrotational mixing in massive stars. We calculated a grid of stellar evolution\nmodels, using the FLAMES sample to calibrate some of the uncertain mixing\nprocesses. We developed a new population-synthesis code, which uses this grid\nto simulate a large population of stars with masses, ages and rotational\nvelocity distributions consistent with those from the FLAMES sample. The\nsynthesized population is then filtered by the selection effects in the\nobserved sample, to enable a direct comparison between the empirical results\nand theoretical predictions. Our simulations reproduce the fraction of stars\nwithout significant nitrogen enrichment. The predicted number of rapid rotators\nwith enhanced nitrogen is about twice as large as found observationally.\nFurthermore, a group of stars consisting of slowly rotating, nitrogen-enriched\nobjects and another consisting of rapidly rotating un-enriched objects can not\nbe reproduced by our single-star population synthesis. Additional physical\nprocesses appear to be required to understand the population of massive\nmain-sequence stars from the FLAMES sample.We discuss the possible role of\nbinary stars and magnetic fields in the interpretation of our results. We find\nthat the population of slowly rotating nitrogen-enriched stars is unlikely\nproduced via mass transfer and subsequent tidal spin-down in close binary\nsystems\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 20:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 14:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Understanding the complexity of the intermediate case in\nwhich the constraints are quantum but all local terms in the Hamiltonian\ncommute, is of importance for conceptual, physical and computational complexity\nreasons. Bravyi and Vyalyi showed in 2003, using a clever application of the\nrepresentation theory of C*-algebras, that if the terms in the Hamiltonian are\nall two-local, the problem is in NP, and the entanglement in the ground states\nis local. The general case remained open since then. In this paper we extend\nthe results of Bravyi and Vyalyi beyond the two-local case, to the case of\nthree-qubit interactions. We then extend our results even further, and show\nthat NP verification is possible for three-wise interaction between qutrits as\nwell, as long as the interaction graph is embedded on a planar lattice, or more\ngenerally, \"Nearly Euclidean\" (NE). The proofs imply that in all such systems,\nthe entanglement in the ground states is local. These extensions imply an\nintriguing sharp transition phenomenon in commuting Hamiltonian systems:\n3-local NE systems based on qubits and qutrits cannot be used to construct\nTopological order, as their entanglement is local, whereas for higher\ndimensional qudits, or for interactions of at least 4 qudits, Topological Order\nis already possible, via Kitaev's Toric Code construction.

A new method of searching for the time-lag between orthogonal\npolarization channels is developed and applied to an ensemble of hot spot\nmodels that samples a wide range of parameter space.

In particular, mixing processes in\nconvectively unstable zones and overshooting regions affect the resulting\nobservables and main sequence lifetime. We study the effects of different\nconvective boundary definitions and mixing prescriptions in convective cores of\nlow-mass stars, to discriminate the existence, size, and evolutionary stage of\nthe central mixed zone by means of asteroseismology. We implemented the Ledoux\ncriterion for convection in our stellar evolution code, together with a\ntime-dependent diffusive approach for mixing of elements when semiconvective\nzones are present. We compared models with masses ranging from 1 M* to 2 M*\ncomputed with two different criteria for convective boundary definition and\nincluding different mixing prescriptions within and beyond the formal limits of\nthe convective regions. Using calculations of adiabatic oscillations\nfrequencies for a large set of models, we developed an asteroseismic diagnosis\nusing only l=0 and l=1 modes based on the ratios of small to large separations\nr01 and r10 defined by Roxburgh & Vorontsov (2003). These variables are almost\nlinear in the expected observable frequency range, and we show that their slope\ndepends simultaneously on the central hydrogen content, the extent of the\nconvective core, and the amplitude of the sound-speed discontinuity at the core\nboundary. By considering about 25 modes and an accuracy in the frequency\ndeterminations as expected from the CoRoT and Kepler missions, the technique we\npropose allows us to detect the presence of a convective core and to\ndiscriminate the different sizes of the homogeneously mixed central region\nwithout the need of a strong a priori for the stellar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

They both contain an accretion\ndisc emitting a thermal radiation, and a non-thermal X-ray emitting corona.\nGBHs exhibit state transitions, and their spectral states are characterized by\ndifferent luminosity levels and shapes of the spectral energy distribution\n(SED). If AGN transitioned in a similar way, the characteristic timescales of\nsuch transitions would exceed ~10^5 years. Thus, the probability to observe an\nindividual AGN transiting between different spectral states is very low. In\nthis paper we follow a spectral evolution of a GBH, GRO~J1655-40, and then\napply its SED evolution pattern to a simulated population of AGN under an\nassumption that a large sample of AGN should contain a mixture of sources in\ndifferent spectral states. We model the X-ray spectra of GRO J1655-40 with the\neqpair model and then scale the best-fitting models with the black hole mass to\nsimulate the AGN spectra. We compare the simulated and observed AGN SEDs to\ndetermine the spectral states of observed Type 1 AGN, LINER and NLS1\npopulations. We conclude that bright Type 1 AGN and NLS1 galaxies are in a\nspectral state similar to the soft spectral state of GBHs, while the spectral\nstate of LINERs may correspond to the hard spectral state of GBHs. We find that\ntaking into account a spread in the black hole masses over several orders of\nmagnitude, as in the observed AGN samples, leads to a correlation between the\nX-ray loudness and the monochromatic luminosity at 2500A, similar to that found\nin observations.

MHD turbulence converts to a KAW cascade, starting at\n10 times the ion gyroradius and continuing to smaller scales.

From\nnumerical solutions of a decaying kinetic Alfv\\'en wave turbulence model,\nstructure morphology reveals two types of localized structures, filaments and\nsheets, and shows that they arise in different regimes of resistive and\ndiffusive damping. Minimal resistive damping yields localized current filaments\nthat form out of Gaussian-distributed initial conditions.

The\nstatistical equilibrium calculations, performed under the assumption of the\nSobolev approximation using the radiative transfer code TORUS, has been\nimproved to include He I and He II energy levels. This allows us to probe the\nphysical conditions of the inner wind of CTTSs by simultaneously modelling the\nrobust wind diagnostic line He I (10830) and the accretion diagnostic lines\nsuch as Pa-beta, Br-gamma and He I (5876). The code has been tested in 1 and\n2-D problems, and we have shown that the results are in agreement with\nestablished codes. We apply the model to the complex flow geometries of CTTSs.\nExample model profiles are computed using the combinations of (1)\nmagnetospheric accretion and disc wind, and (2) magnetospheric accretion and\nthe stellar wind. In both cases, the model produces line profiles which are\nqualitatively similar to those found in observations. Our models are consistent\nwith the scenario in which the narrow blueshifted absorption component of He I\n(10830) seen in observations is caused by a disc wind, and the wider\nblueshifted absorption component (the P-Cygni profile) is caused by a bipolar\nstellar wind. However, we do not have a strong constraint on the relative\nimportance of the wind and the magnetosphere for the `emission' component. Our\npreliminary calculations suggest that the temperatures of the disc wind,\nstellar wind and the magnetosphere cannot be much higher than ~10,000 K, on the\nbasis of the strengths of hydrogen lines. With these low temperatures, we find\nthat the photoionzation by high energy photons (e.g. X-rays) is necessary to\nproduce He I (10830) in emission and to produce the blueshifted absorption\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 03:39:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 16:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

However, in previous theoretical studies of\nplanetary formation in the TNO region, the effect of binary formation has been\nneglected. TNO binaries can be formed through a variety of mechanisms, such as\nthree-body process, dynamical friction on two massive bodies, inelastic\ncollisions between two bodies etc. Most of these mechanisms become more\neffective as the distance from the Sun increases. In this paper, we studied\nthree-body process using direct N-body simulations. We systematically changed\nthe distance from the Sun, the number density of planetesimals, and the radius\nof the planetesimals and studied the effect of the binaries on the collision\nrate of planetesimals. In the TNO region, binaries are involved in 1/3 - 1/2 of\ncollisions, and the collision rate is increased by about a factor of a few\ncompared to the theoretical estimate for the direct two-body collisions. Thus,\nit is possible that the binaries formed through three-body process\nsignificantly enhance the collision rate and reduce the growth time scale. In\nthe terrestrial planet region, binaries are less important, because the ratio\nbetween the Hill radius and physical size of the planetesimals is relatively\nsmall. Although the time scale of our simulations is short, they clearly\ndemonstrated that the accretion process in the TNO region is quite different\nfrom that in the terrestrial planet region. Simulations which cover longer time\nscale are required to obtain more accurate estimate for the accretion\nenhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 04:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-07"}

To address this challenge, the elastic net has been developed and\nsuccessfully applied to many applications. Despite its great success, the\nelastic net does not explicitly use correlation information embedded in data to\nselect correlated variables. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel\nBayesian hybrid model, the EigenNet, that uses the eigenstructures of data to\nguide variable selection. Specifically, it integrates a sparse conditional\nclassification model with a generative model capturing variable correlations in\na principled Bayesian framework. We reparameterize the hybrid model in the\neigenspace to avoid overfiting and to increase the computational efficiency of\nits MCMC sampler. Furthermore, we provide an alternative view to the EigenNet\nfrom a regularization perspective: the EigenNet has an adaptive\neigenspace-based composite regularizer, which naturally generalizes the\n$l_{1/2}$ regularizer used by the elastic net. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal data show that the EigenNet significantly outperforms the lasso, the\nelastic net, and the Bayesian lasso in terms of prediction accuracy, especially\nwhen the number of training samples is smaller than the number of variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 04:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 04:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-09"}

These\nparticles interact with the matter in the stellar wind of the companion star in\nthe system or with crossing clouds, generating gamma-rays via proton-proton\nprocesses. Our aim is to derive the particle distribution in the jet as seen by\nthe observer, so that proper computation of the $\\gamma$-ray and neutrino\nyields can be done. We use relativistic invariants to obtain the transformed\nexpressions in the case of a power-law and power-law with a cutoff particle\ndistribution in the beam. We compare with previous expressions used earlier in\nthe literature. We show that formerly used expressions for the particle\ndistributions in the beam as seen by the observer are in error, differences\nbeing strongly dependent on the viewing angle. For example, for $\\Gamma =10$\n($\\Gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the blob) and angles larger than $\\sim\n20^o$, the earlier-used calculation entails an over-prediction (order of\nmagnitude or more) of the proton spectra for $E>\\Gamma mc^2$, whereas it always\nover-predicts (two orders of magnitude) the proton spectrum at lower energies,\ndisregarding the viewing angle. All the results for photon and neutrino fluxes\nin hadronic models in beams that have made use of the earlier calculation are\naffected. Given that correct gamma-ray fluxes will be in almost any case\nsignificantly diminished in comparison with published results, and that the\ntime of observations in Cherenkov facilities grows with the square of the\nflux-reduction factor in a statistically limited result, the possibility of\nobserving hadronic beams is undermined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 08:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We first derive a\nlinear wave solution, which is not exact in 3D; however, the reflection of\ningoing waves from the centre is close to perfect for moderate amplitude waves.\nWaves with sufficient amplitude to cause isentropic overturning break, and\ndeposit their angular momentum near the centre.

This efficiently absorbs ingoing waves, and spins up the star from\nthe inside out, while the planet spirals into the star. We also perform\nnumerical integrations to determine the linearised adiabatic tidal response\nthroughout the star, for solar-type stellar models with masses in the range 0.5\n< m_star/M_sun < 1.1, throughout their main sequence lifetimes.

The intelligence of\ncurrent computer algorithms has not reached this level of complexity, but there\nare several research efforts that are working towards it. With the number of\nclassification algorithms available, it is hard to determine which algorithm\nworks best for a particular situation. In classification of visual human intent\ndata, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and their variants, are leading candidates.\n  The inability of HMMs to provide a probability in the observation to\nobservation linkages is a big downfall in this classification technique. If a\nperson is visually identifying an action of another person, they monitor\npatterns in the observations. By estimating the next observation, people have\nthe ability to summarize the actions, and thus determine, with pretty good\naccuracy, the intention of the person performing the action. These visual cues\nand linkages are important in creating intelligent algorithms for determining\nhuman actions based on visual observations.\n  The Evidence Feed Forward Hidden Markov Model is a newly developed algorithm\nwhich provides observation to observation linkages. The following research\naddresses the theory behind Evidence Feed Forward HMMs, provides mathematical\nproofs of their learning of these parameters to optimize the likelihood of\nobservations with a Evidence Feed Forwards HMM, which is important in all\ncomputational intelligence algorithm, and gives comparative examples with\nstandard HMMs in classification of both visual action data and measurement\ndata; thus providing a strong base for Evidence Feed Forward HMMs in\nclassification of many types of problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 13:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-07"}

Therefore, by studying\nthe outskirts of galaxies, one can learn about their main formation mechanism.\nI present here our on-going work to characterize the outskirts of Early-Type\nGalaxies (ETGs), which are powerful probes at low redshift of the hierarchical\nmass assembly of galaxies. This work relies on ultra-deep optical images\nobtained at CFHT with the wide-field of view MegaCam camera of field and\ncluster ETGs obtained as part of the Atlas-3D and NGVS projects.

Should this be indeed\nthe case, there will be an impact not only on cosmological scales, but also at\nany scale, from the Solar System to extragalactic ones. In particular, the\ngravitational potential can be different from the Newtonian one commonly\nadopted when computing the circular velocity fitted to spiral galaxies rotation\ncurves. Phenomenologically modelling the modified point mass potential as the\nsum of a Newtonian and a Yukawa like correction, we simulate observed rotation\ncurves for a spiral galaxy described as the sum of an exponential disc and a\nNFW dark matter halo. We then fit these curves assuming parameterized halo\nmodels (either with an inner cusp or a core) and using the Newtonian potential\nto estimate the theoretical rotation curve. Such a study allows us to\ninvestigate the bias on the disc and halo model parameters induced by the\nsystematic error induced by forcing the gravity theory to be Newtonian when it\nis not. As a general result, we find that both the halo scale length and virial\nmass are significantly overestimated, while the dark matter mass fraction\nwithin the disc optical radius is typically underestimated. Moreover, should\nthe Yukawa scale length be smaller than the disc half mass radius, then the\nlogarithmic slope of the halo density profile would turn out to be shallower\nthan the NFW one. Finally, cored models are able to fit quite well the\nsimulated rotation curves, provided the disc mass is biased high in agreement\nwith the results in literature, favoring cored haloes and maximal discs. Such\nresults make us argue that the cusp/core controversy could actually be the\noutcome of an incorrect assumption about which theory of gravity must actually\nbe used in computing the theoretical circular velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 13:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Various models and algorithms\nhave been proposed in the literature in the context of the influence\nmaximization problem. A crucial assumption in all these studies is that the\ninfluence probabilities are known to the social planner. This assumption is\nunrealistic since the influence probabilities are usually private information\nof the individual agents and strategic agents may not reveal them truthfully.\nMoreover, the influence probabilities could vary significantly with the type of\nthe information flowing in the network and the time at which the information is\npropagating in the network. In this paper, we use a mechanism design approach\nto elicit influence probabilities truthfully from the agents. We first work\nwith a simple model, the influencer model, where we assume that each user knows\nthe level of influence she has on her neighbors but this is private\ninformation. In the second model, the influencer-influencee model, which is\nmore realistic, we determine influence probabilities by combining the\nprobability values reported by the influencers and influencees. In the context\nof the first model, we present how VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanisms could\nbe used for truthfully eliciting the influence probabilities. Our main\ncontribution is to design a scoring rule based mechanism in the context of the\ninfluencer-influencee model. In particular, we show the incentive compatibility\nof the mechanisms when the scoring rules are proper and propose a reverse\nweighted scoring rule based mechanism as an appropriate mechanism to use. We\nalso discuss briefly the implementation of such a mechanism in viral marketing\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 14:05:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 08:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

This allows measurements of the azimuthal correlation between a\nforward neutral pion and a second particle in a very large rapidity range.\nDi-hadron azimuthal correlations provide sensitivity to the low longitudinal\nmomentum fraction ($x$) component of the gluon density in the nuclear target.\nInitial state nonlinear effects are in fact expected to appear in d+Au\ncollisions when the dense part of the nucleus is probed. The analysis in this\nthesis shows that such correlations and their dependence on rapidity,\ntransverse momentum and collision centrality are qualitative consistent with\nthe existence of gluon saturation effects in the relativistic nucleus.\nTheoretical expectations for azimuthal correlations between a dilute system\n(deuteron) and a saturated target (Gold nucleus) have been explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 14:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-07"}

We say that explosion occurs if\nan infinite number of particles may be found within a finite distance of the\norigin. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon when the offspring\ndistribution Z is heavy-tailed. Under an appropriate condition, we are able to\ncharacterize the pairs (Z, W) for which explosion occurs, by demonstrating the\nequivalence of explosion with a seemingly much weaker event: that the sum over\ngenerations of the minimum displacement in each generation is finite.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that our condition on the tail is best possible for\nthis equivalence to occur. We also investigate, under additional smoothness\nassumptions, the behavior of $M_n$, the position of the particle in generation\nn closest to the origin, when explosion does not occur (and hence\n$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}M_n=\\infty$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 15:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 18:56:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 11:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-17"}

The standard alternative to threads,\nevent-loop programming, allows much lighter units of concurrency, but leads to\ncode that is difficult to write and even harder to understand. Continuation\nPassing C (CPC) is a translator that converts a program written in threaded\nstyle into a program written with events and native system threads, at the\nprogrammer's choice. Together with two undergraduate students, we taught\nourselves how to program in CPC by writing Hekate, a massively concurrent\nnetwork server designed to efficiently handle tens of thousands of\nsimultaneously connected peers. In this paper, we describe a number of\nprogramming idioms that we learnt while writing Hekate; while some of these\nidioms are specific to CPC, many should be applicable to other programming\nsystems with sufficiently cheap threads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 15:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-07"}
