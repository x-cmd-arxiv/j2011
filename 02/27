The objective is to maximize the\nlong-term sum of utilities across the video terminals in a decentralized\nfashion, by jointly optimizing the packet scheduling, the resource allocation,\nand the cooperation decisions, under the assumption that some nodes are willing\nto act as cooperative relays. A pricing-based distributed resource allocation\nframework is adopted, where the price reflects the expected future congestion\nin the network. Specifically, we formulate the wireless video transmission\nproblem as an MU Markov decision process (MDP) that explicitly considers the\ncooperation at the physical layer and the medium access control sublayer, the\nvideo users' heterogeneous traffic characteristics, the dynamically varying\nnetwork conditions, and the coupling among the users' transmission strategies\nacross time due to the shared wireless resource. Although MDPs notoriously\nsuffer from the curse of dimensionality, our study shows that, with appropriate\nsimplications and approximations, the complexity of the MU-MDP can be\nsignificantly mitigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that integrating\ncooperative decisions into the MU-MDP optimization can increase the resource\nprice in networks that only support low transmission rates and can decrease the\nprice in networks that support high transmission rates. Additionally, our\nresults show that cooperation allows users with feeble direct signals to\nachieve improvements in video quality on the order of 5-10 dB peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), with less than 0.8 dB quality loss by users with\nstrong direct signals, and with a moderate increase in total network energy\nconsumption that is significantly less than the energy that a distant node\nwould require to achieve an equivalent PSNR without exploiting cooperative\ndiversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2011 19:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 23:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

In physical realizations, l >> l_+ and the\nphysics will be dominated by forward scattering which can lead to a charge\nconducting but spin insulating phase.

According to Podkletnov, an anomalous force beam is generated at\nthe discharge, which acts on distant material target of any composition with a\nsmall repulsive force proportional to the target mass. An independent\nreplication of this device was started in 2004 at IGF, Germany (Institut fuer\nGravitationsforschung, Goede Foundation). The author was involved as\ntheoretical consultant and his first assignment was to study a possible\nscaled-down version of the device. This required a thorough analysis of the\nphysical working principles of the apparatus, which was documented in several\ninternal reports from 2004 to 2009. The whole content of those from 2004 to\n2007 is given here. Several parts are outdated, but useful for an understanding\nof the phenomenon. In particular, the discharge mechanism was eventually found\nto be different, namely a vacuum spark discharge instead of a low pressure\ndischarge with cascade gas ionization. Also outdated is the theoretical model\ndeveloped in Ch. 1 on the \"acceleration of Cooper pairs through the\nsuperconductor\" as a possible basis for the anomalous emission. This naive\nrepresentation, however, is useful to show that such an acceleration does not\nmake sense in a superconductor like YBCO and that the correct picture is that\nof (low-voltage) tunnelling of pairs through intrinsic Josephson junctions. The\npresent paper should therefore be regarded as an \"historical summary\", mainly\nvaluable as a reference for further developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2011 21:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-01"}

A relay network with multiple\nsource-destination pairs and multiple relays is considered. All the source\nnodes contend through a random access procedure. A winner source node may give\nup its transmission opportunity if its link quality is poor. In this research,\nwe apply the optimal stopping theory to analyze when a winner node should give\nup its transmission opportunity. By assuming the winner node has information of\nchannel gains of links from itself to relays and from relays to its\ndestination, the existence and uniqueness of an optimal stopping rule are\nrigorously proved. It is also found that the optimal stopping rule is a\npure-threshold strategy. The case when the winner node does not have\ninformation of channel gains of links from relays to its destination is also\nstudied. Two stopping problems exist, one in the main layer (for channel access\nof source nodes), and the other in the sub-layer (for channel access of relay\nnodes). An intuitive stopping rule, where the sub-layer and the main layer\nmaximize their throughput respectively, is shown to be a semi-pure-threshold\nstrategy. The intuitive stopping rule turns out to be non-optimal. An optimal\nstopping rule is then derived theoretically.

An important aspect of Ciao is that, in addition to\nsupporting logic programming (and, in particular, Prolog), it provides the\nprogrammer with a large number of useful features from different programming\nparadigms and styles, and that the use of each of these features (including\nthose of Prolog) can be turned on and off at will for each program module.\nThus, a given module may be using, e.g., higher order functions and\nconstraints, while another module may be using assignment, predicates, Prolog\nmeta-programming, and concurrency. Furthermore, the language is designed to be\nextensible in a simple and modular way. Another important aspect of Ciao is its\nprogramming environment, which provides a powerful preprocessor (with an\nassociated assertion language) capable of statically finding non-trivial bugs,\nverifying that programs comply with specifications, and performing many types\nof optimizations (including automatic parallelization). Such optimizations\nproduce code that is highly competitive with other dynamic languages or, with\nthe (experimental) optimizing compiler, even that of static languages, all\nwhile retaining the flexibility and interactive development of a dynamic\nlanguage. This compilation architecture supports modularity and separate\ncompilation throughout. The environment also includes a powerful\nauto-documenter and a unit testing framework, both closely integrated with the\nassertion system.

The key contributions of the thesis are general exploratory tools\nfor high-throughput data analysis that have provided new insights to\ncell-biological networks, cancer mechanisms and other aspects of genome\nfunction.\n  A central challenge in functional genomics is that high-dimensional genomic\nobservations are associated with high levels of complex and largely unknown\nsources of variation. By combining statistical evidence across multiple\nmeasurement sources and the wealth of background information in genomic data\nrepositories it has been possible to solve some the uncertainties associated\nwith individual observations and to identify functional mechanisms that could\nnot be detected based on individual measurement sources.

Due to the fact that the matter\nand energy content participating in these global phase transitions is a\ncontinuum, there are in effect infinite degrees-of-freedom in the substratum,\nwhich invalidate the usual deterministic laws of the mechanical evolution, and\nallow chance factors to appear in the emergent properties of resonantly-formed\nquantum particles, especially in the acquired phases of their wavefunctions.\nSuch chance factors, though occurring mostly randomly during the early cosmic\nevolution phase, can be harnessed more \"purposefully\" by the biological\nentities co-evolving with the physical universe, due in part to the\nglobally-entangled nature of quantum interactions. Over time, this ability to\ndeliberately manipulate the chance factor in the fundamental level of quantum\ninteractions gradually evolves into the free will and self-awareness of higher\nbiological beings. The emergence of higher-level consciousness in turn greatly\nenhances the entropy-production ability of the biological entities, making them\na powerful new form of the \"dissipative structures\" that nature constructs to\naccelerate the entropy evolution of the universe. It is further shown that\ncomplex, nonequilibrium systems (including the universe as a whole) have the\ninnate ability to spontaneously generate ever-renewable, highly-complex\nstructural features in response to a changing and evolving environment;\ntherefore natural selection is not the only driving mechanism for the\nirreversible evolution of the internal characteristics of biological species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2011 22:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 03:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-15"}
