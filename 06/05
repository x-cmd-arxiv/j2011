A ubiquitous circuit feature that can give rise to such correlations\nconsists of overlapping, or common, inputs to pairs and populations of cells,\nleading to common spike train responses. Here, we use computational tools to\nstudy how the transfer of common input currents into common spike outputs is\nmodulated by the physiology of the recipient cells. We focus on a key\nconductance - gA, for the A-type potassium current - which drives neurons\nbetween \"Type II\" excitability (low gA), and \"Type I\" excitability (high gA).\nRegardless of gA, cells transform common input fluctuations into a ten- dency\nto spike nearly simultaneously. However, this process is more pronounced at low\ngA values, as previously predicted by reduced \"phase\" models. Thus, for a given\nlevel of common input, Type II neurons produce spikes that are relatively more\ncorrelated over short time scales. Over long time scales, the trend reverses,\nwith Type II neurons producing relatively less correlated spike trains. This is\nbecause these cells' increased tendency for simultaneous spiking is balanced by\nopposing tendencies at larger time lags. We demonstrate a novel implication for\nneural signal processing: downstream cells with long time constants are\nselectively driven by Type I cell populations upstream, and those with short\ntime constants by Type II cell populations. Our results are established via\nhigh-throughput numerical simulations, and explained via the cells' filtering\nproperties and nonlinear dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2011 22:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In this paper, we report a long-term monitoring of Mrk 421 over the period\nfrom 2007 November to 2010 February. This source was observed by the\nsatellite-borne experiments Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Swift in the X-ray\nband. Mrk 421 was especially active in the first half of 2008. Many flares are\nobserved in both X-ray and gamma-ray bands simultaneously. The gamma-ray flux\nobserved by ARGO-YBJ has a clear correlation with the X-ray flux. No lag\nbetween the X-ray and gamma-ray photons longer than 1 day is found. The\nevolution of the spectral energy distribution is investigated by measuring\nspectral indices at four different flux levels. Hardening of the spectra is\nobserved in both X-ray and gamma-ray bands. The gamma-ray flux increases\nquadratically with the simultaneously measured X-ray flux. All these\nobservational results strongly favor the synchrotron self-Compton process as\nthe underlying radiative mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2011 13:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The main focus is on the stellar astrophysics of\nX-ray binaries leading to the production of fully recycled MSPs with white\ndwarf (WD) or substellar semi-degenerate companions. Depending on the nature of\nthe companion star MSPs are believed to form from either low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs) or intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs). For each of these\ntwo classes of X-ray binaries the evolutionary status of the donor star -- or\nequivalently, the orbital period -- at the onset of the Roche-lobe overflow\n(RLO) is the determining factor for the outcome of the mass-transfer phase and\nthus the nature of the MSP formed. Furthermore, the formation of binary MSPs is\ndiscussed in context of the (P,P_dot)-diagram, as well as new interpretations\nof the Corbet diagram.
