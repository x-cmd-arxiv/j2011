We expand on the first report of\nthe experiment [1], including a detailed discussion of how the transport\npotentials were calculated. Two main mechanisms that caused motional excitation\nduring transport are explained, along with the methods used to mitigate such\nexcitation. We reduced the motional excitation below the results in Ref. [1] by\na factor of approximately 50. The effect of a mu-metal shield on qubit\ncoherence is also reported. Finally, we examined a method for exchanging energy\nbetween multiple motional modes on the few-quanta level, which could be useful\nfor cooling motional modes without directly accessing the modes with lasers.\nThese results establish how trapped ions can be transported in a large-scale\nquantum processor with high fidelity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 16:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Four\nmethods are examined, one which manipulates the Stokes spectra to simulate\nspatial-resolution degradation, and three \"post-facto\" methods where the\nmagnetic field maps are manipulated directly. Throughout, statistical\ncomparisons of the degraded maps with the originals serve to quantify the\noutcomes. Overall, we find that areas with inferred magnetic fill fractions\nclose to unity may be insensitive to optical spatial resolution; areas of\nsub-unity fill fractions are very sensitive. Trends with worsening spatial\nresolution can include increased average field strength, lower total flux, and\na field vector oriented closer to the line of sight. Further-derived quantities\nsuch as vertical current density show variations even in areas of high average\nmagnetic fill-fraction. In short, unresolved maps fail to represent the\ndistribution of the underlying unresolved fields, and the \"post-facto\" methods\ngenerally do not reproduce the effects of a smaller telescope aperture.

The survey includes, for the first time, full\nspatial coverage of the SMC bar, wing, and tail regions at infrared (IR)\nwavelengths (3.6 - 160 microns). We identify evolved stars using a combination\nof near-IR and mid-IR photometry and point out a new feature in the mid-IR\ncolor-magnitude diagram that may be due to particularly dusty O-rich AGB stars.\nWe find that the RSG and AGB stars each contribute ~20% of the global SMC flux\n(extended + point-source) at 3.6 microns, which emphasizes the importance of\nboth stellar types to the integrated flux of distant metal-poor galaxies. The\nequivalent SAGE survey of the higher-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud\n(SAGE-LMC) allows us to explore the influence of metallicity on dust\nproduction. We find that the SMC RSG stars are less likely to produce a large\namount of dust (as indicated by the [3.6]-[8] color). There is a higher\nfraction of carbon-rich stars in the SMC, and these stars appear to able to\nreach colors as red as their LMC counterparts, indicating that C-rich dust\nforms efficiently in both galaxies. A preliminary estimate of the dust\nproduction in AGB and RSG stars reveals that the extreme C-rich AGB stars\ndominate the dust input in both galaxies, and that the O-rich stars may play a\nlarger role in the LMC than in the SMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 17:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

For the neutral and the\nnegative charged systems more two different geometrical configurations occur\nwith higher energies, which evidence the existence of metastable sites of H in\nthe Yttria lattice.

The\nphysical mechanism of this mass loss is however relatively poorly known.\nBetelgeuse is the nearest RSG, and as such a prime object for high angular\nresolution observations of its surface (by interferometry) and close\ncircumstellar environment. Aims: The goal of our program is to understand how\nthe material expelled from Betelgeuse is transported from its surface to the\ninterstellar medium, and how it evolves chemically in this process. Methods: We\nobtained diffraction-limited images of Betelgeuse and a PSF calibrator\n(Aldebaran) in six filters in the N band (7.76 to 12.81 mic) and two filters in\nthe Q band (17.65 and 19.50 mic), using the VLT/VISIR instrument. Results: Our\nimages show a bright, extended and complex circumstellar envelope at all\nwavelengths. It is particularly prominent longwards of 9-10 mic, pointing at\nthe presence of O-rich dust, such as silicates or alumina. A partial circular\nshell is observed between 0.5 and 1.0\" from the star, and could correspond to\nthe inner radius of the dust envelope.

Observations indicate that the intensities and\nvelocities measured in active region cores are effectively steady, suggesting\nthat heating events occur rapidly enough to keep high temperature active region\nloops close to equilibrium. In this paper, we couple observations of Active\nRegion 10955 made with XRT and EIS on \\textit{Hinode} to test a simple steady\nheating model. First we calculate the differential emission measure of the apex\nregion of the loops in the active region core. We find the DEM to be broad and\npeaked around 3\\,MK. We then determine the densities in the corresponding\nfootpoint regions. Using potential field extrapolations to approximate the loop\nlengths and the density-sensitive line ratios to infer the magnitude of the\nheating, we build a steady heating model for the active region core and find\nthat we can match the general properties of the observed DEM for the\ntemperature range of 6.3 $<$ Log T $<$ 6.7.

We also find, however, that the steady heating\nmodel cannot address the emission observed at lower temperatures. This emission\nmay be due to foreground or background structures, or may indicate that the\nheating in the core is more complicated.

The criterion for orbital stability based on the\nLyapunov exponents is independently verified by using power spectra. The\nobtained results are compared to results presented in the two previous papers\nof this series. It is shown that the maximum Lyapunov exponent can be used as\nan indicator for chaotic behaviour of planetary orbits, which is consistent\nwith previous applications of this method, particularly studies for the Solar\nSystem. The chaotic behaviour corresponds to either orbital stability or\ninstability, and it depends solely on the mass ratio of the binary components\nand the initial distance ratio of the planet relative to the stellar separation\ndistance. Our theoretical results allow us to link the study of planetary\norbital stability to chaos theory noting that there is a large array of\nliterature on the properties and significance of Lyapunov exponents.

Large-scale deployment of PEVs currently faces many challenges. One\nparticular concern is that the PEV charging can potentially cause significant\nimpacts on the existing power distribution system, due to the increase in peak\nload. As such, this work tries to mitigate the impacts of PEV charging by\nproposing a decentralized smart PEV charging algorithm to minimize the\ndistribution system load variance, so that a `flat' total load profile can be\nobtained. The charging algorithm is myopic, in that it controls the PEV\ncharging processes in each time slot based entirely on the current power system\nstates, without knowledge about future system dynamics. We provide theoretical\nguarantees on the asymptotic optimality of the proposed charging algorithm.\nThus, compared to other forecast based smart charging approaches in the\nliterature, the charging algorithm not only achieves optimality asymptotically\nin an on-line, and decentralized manner, but also is robust against various\nuncertainties in the power system, such as random PEV driving patterns and\ndistributed generation (DG) with highly intermittent renewable energy sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 20:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2011 06:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Cha III does not show any sign of star formation,\nwhile star formation has been very active in Cha I and may already be\nfinishing. Our goal is to determine whether star formation can proceed in Cha\nIII, and to compare the results to our recent survey of Cha I. We used the\nLarge APEX Bolometer Array (LABOCA) to map Cha III in dust continuum emission\nat 870 micron. 29 sources are extracted from the map, all of them being\nstarless. The starless cores are found down to a visual extinction of 1.9 mag,\nin marked contrast with other molecular clouds, including Cha I. Apart from\nthis difference, the Cha III starless cores share very similar properties with\nthose found in Cha I. At most two sources have a mass larger than the critical\nBonnor-Ebert mass, which suggests that the fraction of prestellar cores is very\nlow, even lower than in Cha I. Only the most massive sources are candidate\nprestellar cores, in agreement with the correlation found earlier in the Pipe\nnebula. The mass distribution of the 85 starless cores of Cha I and III that\nare not candidate prestellar cores is consistent with a single power law down\nto the 90% completeness limit, with an exponent close to the Salpeter value. A\nfraction of the starless cores in Cha I and III may still grow in mass and\nbecome gravitationally unstable. Based on predictions of numerical simulations\nof turbulent molecular clouds, we estimate that at most 50% and 20% of the\nstarless cores of Cha I and III, respectively, may form stars. The LABOCA\nsurvey reveals that Cha III, and Cha I to some extent too, is a prime target to\nstudy the formation of prestellar cores, and thus the onset of star formation.\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 20:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The\nunderlying Hamiltonian is a mean field Hamiltonian that incorporates a two-fold\ncommensurate Fermi surface reconsruction. While the specific mean field\nconsidered is the $d$-density wave, similar results can also be obtained by a\nmodel of a spin density wave, as was explicitly demonstrated earlier. The\nresults are consistent with an interplay of magnetic breakdown across small\ngaps in the reconstructed Fermi surface and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 23:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-20"}

Most of the flux from RGs comes from the Southern sky, and most\nof the flux of particles from GRB comes from the North, although the\ndifferences are so small as to require large statistics to confirm this.

The problem\nreduces to estimate a quadratic form (called \"localization function\") of a\ncertain projection matrix related to the source signal empirical covariance\nmatrix. Recently, a new subspace estimation method (called \"G-MUSIC\") has been\nproposed, in the context where the number of available samples $N$ is of the\nsame order of magnitude than the number of sensors $M$. In this context, the\ntraditional subspace methods tend to fail because the empirical covariance\nmatrix of the observations is a poor estimate of the source signal covariance\nmatrix. The G-MUSIC method is based on a new consistent estimator of the\nlocalization function in the regime where $M$ and $N$ tend to $+\\infty$ at the\nsame rate. However, the consistency of the angles estimator was not adressed.\nThe purpose of this paper is to prove the consistency of the angles of arrival\nestimator in the previous asymptotic regime. To prove this result, we show the\nproperty that the singular values of M x N Gaussian information plus noise\nmatrix escape from certain intervals is an event of probability decreasing at\nrate O(1/N^p) for all p. A regularization trick is also introduced, which\nallows to confine these singular values into certain intervals and to use\nstandard tools as Poincar\\'e inequality to characterize any moments of the\nestimator. These results are believed to be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2011 09:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-28"}
