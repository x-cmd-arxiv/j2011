This increased redshift precision\nis achieved by imposing an isotropy and 2-point correlation prior in a Bayesian\nanalysis and is completely independent of the process that estimates the\nphotometric redshift. As a byproduct, the method also infers the three\ndimensional density field, essentially super-resolving high density regions in\nredshift space. Our method fully takes into account the survey mask and\nselection function. It uses a simplified Poissonian picture of galaxy\nformation, relating preferred locations of galaxies to regions of higher\ndensity in the matter field. The method quantifies the remaining uncertainties\nin the three dimensional density field and the true radial locations of\ngalaxies by generating samples that are constrained by the survey data.

The separation between the\nspacecraft was 1,000 km, with atom interferometers 200 m long and shades from\nsunlight used at each end. A careful analysis of many error sources was\nincluded, but requirements on the time-stability of both the laser wavefront\naberrations and the atom temperatures in the atom clouds were not investigated.\nAfter including these considerations, the laser wavefront aberration stability\nrequirement to meet the quoted sensitivity level is about 1\\times10-8\nwavelengths, and is far tighter than for LISA. Also, the temperature\nfluctuations between atom clouds have to be less than 1 pK.

For this problem, we propose a novel partial\nhard-thresholding operator that leads to a general family of iterative\nalgorithms. While one extreme of the family yields well known hard thresholding\nalgorithms like ITI (Iterative Thresholding with Inversion) and HTP (Hard\nThresholding Pursuit), the other end of the spectrum leads to a novel algorithm\nthat we call Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement (OMPR). OMPR, like\nthe classic greedy algorithm OMP, adds exactly one coordinate to the support at\neach iteration, based on the correlation with the current residual. However,\nunlike OMP, OMPR also removes one coordinate from the support. This simple\nchange allows us to prove that OMPR has the best known guarantees for sparse\nrecovery in terms of the Restricted Isometry Property (a condition on the\nmeasurement matrix). In contrast, OMP is known to have very weak performance\nguarantees under RIP. Given its simple structure, we are able to extend OMPR\nusing locality sensitive hashing to get OMPR-Hash, the first provably\nsub-linear (in dimensionality) algorithm for sparse recovery. Our proof\ntechniques are novel and flexible enough to also permit the tightest known\nanalysis of popular iterative algorithms such as CoSaMP and Subspace Pursuit.\nWe provide experimental results on large problems providing recovery for\nvectors of size up to million dimensions. We demonstrate that for large-scale\nproblems our proposed methods are more robust and faster than existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 18:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-15"}

In particular, near-capacity achieving code designs based on LDPC codes\nhave been presented for the case of two binary sources, with a binary-symmetric\ncorrelation. However, constructing practical codes for the case of non-binary\nsources with arbitrary correlation remains by and large open. From a practical\nperspective it is also interesting to consider coding schemes whose performance\nremains robust to uncertainties in the joint distribution of the sources.\n  In this work we propose the usage of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes for the\nasymmetric version of this problem. We show that algebraic soft-decision\ndecoding of RS codes can be used effectively under certain correlation\nstructures. In addition, RS codes offer natural rate adaptivity and performance\nthat remains constant across a family of correlation structures with the same\nconditional entropy. The performance of RS codes is compared with dedicated and\nrate adaptive multistage LDPC codes (Varodayan et al. '06), where each LDPC\ncode is used to compress the individual bit planes. Our simulations show that\nin classical Slepian-Wolf scenario, RS codes outperform both dedicated and\nrate-adaptive LDPC codes under $q$-ary symmetric correlation, and are better\nthan rate-adaptive LDPC codes in the case of sparse correlation models, where\nthe conditional distribution of the sources has only a few dominant entries. In\na feedback scenario, the performance of RS codes is comparable with both\ndesigns of LDPC codes. Our simulations also demonstrate that the performance of\nRS codes in the presence of inaccuracies in the joint distribution of the\nsources is much better as compared to multistage LDPC codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 19:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-15"}

In particular, the recently developed\nnon-linear heteroscedastic regression methods for ABC are implemented. The abc\npackage also includes a cross-validation tool for measuring the accuracy of ABC\nestimates, and to calculate the misclassification probabilities when performing\nmodel selection. The main functions are accompanied by appropriate summary and\nplotting tools. Considering an example of demographic inference with population\ngenetics data, we show the potential of the R package.\n  R is already widely used in bioinformatics and several fields of biology. The\nR abc package will make the ABC algorithms available to the large number of R\nusers. abc is a freely available R package under the GPL license, and it can be\ndownloaded at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/index.html.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 19:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-15"}

A total of 74 model calculations are performed for a range of different\ninitial parameters. Interactions include fly-by and merger cases. The fraction\nof counter-orbiting material produced varies over a wide range (from a few up\nto 50 percent). All fly-by models show a similar two-phase behaviour, with\nretrograde material forming first. Properties of the prograde and retrograde\npopulations are extracted to make an observational discrimination possible.\n  During such encounters the tidal debris occupies a certain region in phase\nspace. In this material, tidal-dwarf galaxies may form. The modelling therefore\ncan explain why galaxies may have dwarf galaxies orbiting counter to the bulk\nof their dwarf galaxies. An example is the Sculptor dwarf of the Milky Way,\nwhich orbits counter to the bulk of the disc of satellites. The modelling thus\nsupports the scenario of the MW satellites being ancient tidal-dwarf galaxies\nformed from gaseous material stripped from another galaxy during an encounter\nwith the young MW.\n  A possible candidate for this galaxy is identified as the Magellanic Cloud\nprogenitor galaxy.

A strong FUV radiation dissociates H2 and quenches its cooling. Even\nin such an environment, a massive cloud with Tvir>10^4 K can contract\nisothermally at 8000 K by Lyman alpha cooling. This cloud collapses\nmonolithically without fragmentation, and a supermassive star (>10^5 Msun) is\nbelieved to form at the center, which eventually evolves to a supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH). However, candidates of FUV sources, including star-forming\ngalaxies, are probably sources of strong CRs and X-rays, as well. We find that\nthe external ionization promotes H2 production and elevates the threshold FUV\nintensity Jcr needed for the SMBH formation for CR energy density U_CR>10^-14\nerg/cm^3 or X-ray intensity J_X>10^-24 erg/s/cm^2/sr/Hz at 1 keV. The critical\nFUV flux increases in proportion to U_CR^{1/2} (J_X^{1/2}) in the high CR\n(X-ray, respectively) limit. With the same value of FUV intensity at the Lyman\nlimit (13.6 eV), the H^- photodissociation rate, with threshold of 0.755 eV,\nincreases and the H2 molecules decrease with decreasing effective temperature\nof the FUV sources T*. The lower value of T* thus results in the lower critical\nFUV flux at 13.6 eV. Using an empirical relation between intensities of FUV and\nCR/X-ray from nearby star-forming galaxies, we find that external ionization\neffect remarkably enhances the critical FUV flux for sources with T* as high as\n10^5 K and composed of stars with <100 Msun to a level that is not realized in\nany halo. This indicates that, to induce SMBH formation, the FUV sources must\nbe either Pop II/I galaxies with low brightness temperature, Pop III galaxies\nwith a very top-heavy IMF, or Pop III galaxies too young to harbor sources of\nCR/X-ray, e.g., supernova remnants or high-mass X-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 20:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

For each system photoionization models are constructed varying the\nspectrum of the ionizing radiation. The spectral energy distribution can then\nbe constrained by comparing the models with the observed column density ratios.\nExtensive tests with artificial absorbers show that the spectrum of the\nionizing radiation cannot be reconstructed unambiguously, but it is possible to\nconstrain the main characteristics of the spectrum. Furthermore, the resulting\nphysical parameters of the absorber, such as ionization parameter, metallicity,\nand relative abundances, may depend strongly on the adopted ionizing spectrum.\nEven in case of well-fitting models the uncertainties can be as high as ~0.5\ndex for the ionization parameter and up to ~1.5 dex for the metallicity.\nTherefore, it is essential to know the hardness of the UV background when\nestimating the metallicity of the intergalactic medium.

Typically, training sets are derived from historical surveys of\nbrighter, more nearby objects than those from more extensive, deeper surveys\n(testing data). This sample selection bias can cause catastrophic errors in\npredictions on the testing data because a) standard assumptions for\nmachine-learned model selection procedures break down and b) dense regions of\ntesting space might be completely devoid of training data. We explore possible\nremedies to sample selection bias, including importance weighting (IW),\nco-training (CT), and active learning (AL). We argue that AL---where the data\nwhose inclusion in the training set would most improve predictions on the\ntesting set are queried for manual follow-up---is an effective approach and is\nappropriate for many astronomical applications. For a variable star\nclassification problem on a well-studied set of stars from Hipparcos and OGLE,\nAL is the optimal method in terms of error rate on the testing data, beating\nthe off-the-shelf classifier by 3.4% and the other proposed methods by at least\n3.0%. To aid with manual labeling of variable stars, we developed a web\ninterface which allows for easy light curve visualization and querying of\nexternal databases. Finally, we apply active learning to classify variable\nstars in the ASAS survey, finding dramatic improvement in our agreement with\nthe ACVS catalog, from 65.5% to 79.5%, and a significant increase in the\nclassifier's average confidence for the testing set, from 14.6% to 42.9%, after\na few AL iterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 22:05:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 03:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Stars of spectral type A and B are called Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe)\nstars in this stage, all later spectral types are termed classical T Tauri\nstars (CTTS). Both types are studied by high-resolution X-ray and UV\nspectroscopy and modeling. Three mechanisms contribute to the high-energy\nemission from CTTS: 1) CTTS have active coronae similar to main-sequence stars,\n2) the accreted material passes through an accretion shock at the stellar\nsurface, which heats it to a few MK, and 3) some CTTS drive powerful outflows.\nShocks within these jets can heat the plasma to X-ray emitting temperatures.\nCoronae are already well characterized in the literature; for the latter two\nscenarios models are shown. The magnetic field suppresses motion perpendicular\nto the field lines in the accretion shock, thus justifying a 1D geometry. The\nradiative loss is calculated as optically thin emission. A mixture of shocked\nand coronal gas is fitted to X-ray observations of accreting CTTS.\nSpecifically, the model explains the peculiar line-ratios in the He-like\ntriplets of Ne IX and O VII. All stars require only small mass accretion rates\nto power the X-ray emission. In contrast, the HAeBe HD 163296 has line ratios\nsimilar to coronal sources, indicating that neither a high density nor a strong\nUV-field is present in the region of the X-ray emission. This could be caused\nby a shock in its jet. Similar emission is found in the deeply absorbed CTTS DG\nTau. Shock velocities between 400 and 500 km/s are required to explain the\nobserved spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 23:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-16"}

Such a particle should consist of a continuous\ndistribution of energy over all space, the energy density tending to zero at\ninfinity. To achieve this aim, we introduce into the theory of general\nrelativity the postulate that the gravitational, electric and nuclear fields\nare special cases of a more general field. An expression is obtained for the\ngravitational potential which differs from the usual expression of the\npotential accepted in general relatvity, and which gives an energy density for\nthe particle at every point of space, the integral of which over all space is\nequal to the mass of the particle, the greatest part of the mass being\nconcentrated near the center of the spherical pattern constituting the\nparticle. The particle is thus seen to consist of the energy of its field. No\ninfinities are encountered in the integrations. The same result is obtained for\na charged particle. The charge density is spread out over all space and the\nintegrals of the charge density and energy density are respectively equal to\nthe charge and mass of the particle. The electric potential this obtained is\ninserted in Dirac's wave equation, and gives a series of equations of\nincreasing degree, the first of which gives the mass of the muon. When inserted\nin Dirac's wave equation, this potential gives the values of the masses of\nbaryons.

The first one is the energy-kick (EK) method. To\napply this method, one adds an external energy kick to a particle in the\nlattice, and tracks its evolution by evolving the kicked system. The second one\nis the fluctuation-correlation (FC) method. The formula for calculating the\nprobability density function (PDF) using the canonical ensemble is slightly\nrevised and extended to the microcanonical ensemble. We show that the FC method\nhas advantages over the EK method theoretically and technically. Theoretically,\nthe PDF obtained by the FC method reveals the diffusion processes of the inner\nenergy while the PDF obtained by the EK method represents that of the kick\nenergy. The diffusion processes of the inner energy and the external energy\nadded to the system, i.e., the kick energy, may be different quantitatively and\neven qualitatively depending on models. To show these facts, we study not only\nthe equilibrium systems but also the stationary nonequilibrium systems.\nExamples showing that the inner energy and the kick energy may have different\ndiffusion behavior are reported in both cases. The technical advantage enables\nus to study the long-time diffusion processes and thus avoids the finite-time\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 03:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-16"}

This work investigates the origin of\nthe observed temperatures, by examining the relationship between them and the\ngalaxy structure, the gas heating due to Type Ia supernovae (SNIa's) and the\ngravitational potential, and the dynamical status of the gas flow. In galaxies\nwith sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for\nthe gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower\nthan this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow\nstatus; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for\ninfall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be\ndominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to\n~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest\ngalaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower\nthan in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by\nSNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value\nat the largest sigma_c. This same energy input, though, would produce\ntemperatures larger than observed at low sigma_c, if entirely thermalized. The\nvalues of the observed T's increase from outflows to inflows; the gas is\nrelatively hotter in outflows, though, if the T's are rescaled by the virial\ntemperature. For 200<sigma_c(km/s)<250, lower L_X values tend to correspond to\nlower T's, which deserves further investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 08:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Our search yielded 88 candidates,\nseveral of which were previously identified and discussed in the literature.\nThe widths of the broad H-beta lines are typical among quasars but the shifts\nare extreme. We found a correlation between the peak offset and skewness of the\nbroad H-beta profiles, which suggests that the profiles we have selected share\na common physical explanation. The general properties of the narrow emission\nlines are typical of quasars. We carried out followup spectroscopic\nobservations of 68 objects to search for changes in the peak velocities of the\nH-beta lines (the time interval in the observer's frame between the original\nand new observations is 1-10 yr). We measured significant changes in 14\nobjects, with resulting accelerations between -120 and +120 km/s/yr.

Many more\nfollowup observations over a long temporal baseline are needed to characterize\nthe variability pattern of the broad lines and test that this pattern is indeed\nconsistent with orbital motion. The possibility that some of the objects in\nthis sample are rapidly recoiling black holes remains open as the available\ndata do not provide strong constraints for this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 12:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The\nmechanical interplay between these different crosslinker types is an open issue\nin cytoskeletal mechanics. We develop a framework to study the cooperativity\nand redundancy in the mechanics of filamentous networks with two types of\ncrosslinkers: crosslinkers that allow free rotations of filaments and\ncrosslinkers that do not. The framework consists of numerical simulations and\nan effective medium theory on a percolating triangular lattice. We find that\nthe introduction of angle-constraining crosslinkers significantly lowers the\nfilament concentrations required for these networks to attain mechanical\nintegrity. This cooperative effect also enhances the stiffness of the network\nand suppresses non-affine deformations at a fixed filament concentration. We\nfurther find that semiflexible networks with only freely-rotating crosslinks\nare mechanically very similar to compositely crosslinked flexible networks with\nboth networks exhibiting the same scaling behavior. We show that the network\nmechanics can either be redundant or cooperative depending on the relative\nenergy scale of filament bending to the energy stored in the angle-constraining\ncrosslinkers, and the relative concentration of crosslinkers. Our results may\nhave implications for understanding the role of multiple crosslinkers even in a\nsystem without bundle formation or other structural motifs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 15:48:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 14:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The notion of cancer progression as an evolutionary process has been\nexperiencing increasing interest in recent years. Many efforts have been made\nto better understand and predict the progression to cancer using mathematical\nmodels; these mostly consider the evolution of a well-mixed cell population,\neven though pre-cancerous cells often evolve in highly structured epithelial\ntissues. We propose a novel model of cancer progression that considers a\nspatially structured cell population where clones expand via adaptive waves.\nThis model is used to asses two different paradigms of asexual evolution that\nhave been suggested to delineate the process of cancer progression. The\nstandard scenario of periodic selection assumes that driver mutations are\naccumulated strictly sequentially over time. However, when the mutation supply\nis sufficiently high, clones may arise simultaneously on distinct genetic\nbackgrounds, and clonal adaptation waves interfere with each other. We find\nthat in the presence of clonal interference, spatial structure increases the\nwaiting time for cancer, leads to a patchwork structure of non-uniformly sized\nclones, decreases the survival probability of virtually neutral (passenger)\nmutations, and that genetic distance begins to increase over a characteristic\nlength scale, determined here. These characteristic features of clonal\ninterference may help to predict the onset of cancers with pronounced spatial\nstructure and to interpret spatially-sampled genetic data obtained from\nbiopsies. Our estimates suggest that clonal interference likely occurs in the\nprogressing colon cancer, and possibly other cancers where spatial structure\nmatters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 15:51:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 22:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 21:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-05"}
