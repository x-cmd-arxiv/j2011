Indeed, the minimum and\nmaximum eigenvalues of the frame operator are the optimal frame bounds, and the\nframe is tight precisely when this spectrum is constant. Often, the second-most\nimportant design consideration is the lengths of frame vectors: Gabor, wavelet,\nequiangular and Grassmannian frames are all special cases of equal norm frames,\nand unit norm tight frame-based encoding is known to be optimally robust\nagainst additive noise and erasures. We consider the problem of constructing\nframes whose frame operator has a given spectrum and whose vectors have\nprescribed lengths. For a given spectrum and set of lengths, the existence of\nsuch frames is characterized by the Schur-Horn Theorem---they exist if and only\nif the spectrum majorizes the squared lengths---the classical proof of which is\nnonconstructive. Certain construction methods, such as harmonic frames and\nspectral tetris, are known in the special case of unit norm tight frames, but\neven these provide but a few examples from the manifold of all such frames, the\ndimension of which is known and nontrivial. In this paper, we provide a new\nmethod for explicitly constructing any and all frames whose frame operator has\na prescribed spectrum and whose vectors have prescribed lengths. The method\nitself has two parts. In the first part, one chooses eigensteps---a sequence of\ninterlacing spectra---that transform the trivial spectrum into the desired one.\nThe second part is to explicitly compute the frame vectors in terms of these\neigensteps; though nontrivial, this process is nevertheless straightforward\nenough to be implemented by hand, involving only arithmetic, square roots and\nmatrix multiplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2011 18:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-07"}

The magnetic field\nstrength (line-of-sight component) in the regions ranges from 2 to 6\nmicrogauss, which is similar to the typical magnetic field strength in the\ndiffuse interstellar medium. We investigated the relationship between magnetic\nfield strength and electron density in the 5 HII regions. The slope of magnetic\nfield vs. density in the low-density regime (0.8 < n_e < 30 per cubic cm) is\nvery slightly above zero. We also calculated the ratio of thermal to magnetic\npressure, beta_th, for each data point, which fell in the range 1.01 < beta_th\n< 25. Finally, we studied the orientation of the magnetic field in the solar\nneighborhood (d < 1.1 kpc) using our data from 5 HII regions along with\nexisting measurements of the line-of-sight magnetic field strength from\npolarized pulsars whose distances have been determined from their annual\nparallax.

Our theoretical and empirical comparisons\nillustrate that usually $b$-bit minwise hashing is significantly more accurate\n(at the same storage) than VW (and random projections) in binary data.\nFurthermore, $b$-bit minwise hashing can be combined with VW to achieve further\nimprovements in terms of training speed, especially when $b$ is large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 06:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-07"}

The lines could be observed in the MeV band with a future space mission\nsuch as GRIPS which has been proposed to ESA as an all-sky survey mission with\ngamma-ray, X-ray and near-infrared telescopes. In MeV gamma rays, its\nsensitivity will improve by a factor of 40 compared with previous missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 11:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-07"}

The\nbispectrum is a natural and widely studied tool for measuring the\nnon-Gaussianity in a model-independent way.

This enables the linear PLS method to\ndescribe non-linear relationship more accurately and provides the\nstatistics-based PLS method with physical backgrounds. Moreover, a secondary\nPLS is applied utilizing the whole spectra information to further correct the\nmodel results. Experiments were conducted using standard brass samples. Taylor\nexpansion was applied to make the nonlinear transformation to describe the\nself-absorption effect of Cu. Then, line intensities of another two elements,\nPb and Zn, were taken into account for inter-element interference. The proposed\nmethod shows a significant improvement when compared with conventional PLS\nmodel. Results also show that, even compared with the already-improved baseline\ndominant-factor-based PLS model, the present PLS model based on the\nmultivariate dominant factor yields the same calibration quality (R2=0.999)\nwhile decreasing the RMSEP from 2.33% to 1.97%. The overall RMSE was also\nimproved to 1.05% from 1.27%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 12:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-07"}

The two populations can be modelled with Michie-King\ndistribution functions (DFs) in the isothermal and in the sharply truncated\nlimits, respectively. We argue that the truncation of the metal-rich population\ncan be traced back to the spatial distribution of the star forming gas.

The fractal dimension evolution of urban growth can be empirically\nmodeled with Boltzmann's equation. For the normalized data, Boltzmann's\nequation is equivalent to the logistic function. The logistic equation can be\ntransformed into the well-known 1-dimensional logistic map, which is based on a\n2-dimensional map suggesting spatial replacement dynamics of city development.\nThe 2-dimensional recurrence relations can be employed to generate the\nnonlinear dynamical behaviors such as bifurcation and chaos. A discovery is\nmade that, for the fractal dimension growth following the logistic curve, the\nnormalized dimension value is the ratio of space filling. If the rate of\nspatial replacement (urban growth) is too high, the periodic oscillations and\nchaos will arise, and the city system will fall into disorder. The spatial\nreplacement dynamics can be extended to general replacement dynamics, and\nbifurcation and chaos seem to be related with some kind of replacement process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 14:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

Here we focus on\nhomogeneous tensor networks, where all the tensors in the network are copies of\nthe same tensor, and argue that certain structural properties of the resulting\nmany-body states are preconditioned by the geometry of the tensor network and\nare therefore largely independent of the choice of variational parameters.\nIndeed, the asymptotic decay of correlations in homogeneous MPS and MERA for\nD=1 systems is seen to be determined by the structure of geodesics in the\nphysical and holographic geometries, respectively; whereas the asymptotic\nscaling of entanglement entropy is seen to always obey a simple boundary law --\nthat is, again in the relevant geometry. This geometrical interpretation offers\na simple and unifying framework to understand the structural properties of, and\nhelps clarify the relation between, different tensor network states. In\naddition, it has recently motivated the branching MERA, a generalization of the\nMERA capable of reproducing violations of the entropic boundary law in D>1\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 14:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-02"}

Finally, our images reveal distinct\nsubstructures between 25-35 AU physical separation from the star and we discuss\nthe possible origin for the two features in the context of ongoing planet\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 15:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Here, we present the most\nrecent results of a continuing programme to model the morphologies of all\nplanetary nebulae known to host a close binary central star. Initially, this\nprogramme allows us to compare the inclination of the nebular symmetry axis to\nthat of the binary plane, testing the theoretical expectation that they will\nlie perpendicular - to date, all have satisfied this expectation, indicating\nthat each nebula has been shaped by its central binary star. As a greater\nsample of nebulae are modelled, it will be possible to search for trends\nconnecting the parameters of both nebula and central binary, strengthening our\nunderstanding of the processes at work in these objects. I will discuss some of\nthe more obvious comparisons, and their current statuses, as well as the\nobvious links to common envelope evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 15:56:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 01:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-16"}

The currently most advanced\ndescription of Quantum Supergravity and beyond is Superstring Theory/M-Theory\nin 10/11 dimensions. String Theory is a top-to-bottom approach to Quantum\nSupergravity in that it postulates a new object, the string, from which\nclassical Supergravity emerges as a low energy limit. On the other hand, one\nmay try more traditional bottom-to-top routes and apply the techniques of\nQuantum Field Theory. Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is a manifestly background\nindependent and non-perturbative approach to the quantisation of classical\nGeneral Relativity, however, so far mostly without supersymmetry. The main\nobstacle to the extension of the techniques of LQG to the quantisation of\nhigher dimensional Supergravity is that LQG rests on a specific connection\nformulation of General Relativity which exists only in D+1 = 4 dimensions. In\nthis Letter we introduce a new connection formulation of General Relativity\nwhich exists in all space-time dimensions. We show that all LQG techniques\ndeveloped in D+1 = 4 can be transferred to the new variables in all dimensions\nand describe how they can be generalised to the new types of fields that appear\nin Supergravity theories as compared to standard matter, specifically\nRarita-Schwinger and p-form gauge fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 15:57:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 07:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-13"}

Thus, energy\nconsumption is becoming one of the major concerns regarding the current and\nupcoming wireless communication systems. On the other hand, the available\nbandwidth resources are limited and modern applications are throughput\ndemanding, leading thus to strong competition for the medium. In this\ndirection, we consider a stochastic contention based medium access scheme,\nwhere the devices may choose to turn off for some time in order to save energy.\nWe perform an analysis for a slotted ALOHA scenario and we show that the energy\nconstraints, if properly exploited, may reduce contention for the medium.
