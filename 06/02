It is notably effective at solving\nhard Random 3-SAT instances near the so-called `satisfiability threshold', but\nstill shows a peak in search cost near the threshold and large variations in\ncost over different instances. We make a number of significant contributions to\nthe analysis of WSat on high-cost random instances, using the\nrecently-introduced concept of the backbone of a SAT instance. The backbone is\nthe set of literals which are entailed by an instance. We find that the number\nof solutions predicts the cost well for small-backbone instances but is much\nless relevant for the large-backbone instances which appear near the threshold\nand dominate in the overconstrained region. We show a very strong correlation\nbetween search cost and the Hamming distance to the nearest solution early in\nWSat's search. This pattern leads us to introduce a measure of the backbone\nfragility of an instance, which indicates how persistent the backbone is as\nclauses are removed. We propose that high-cost random instances for local\nsearch are those with very large backbones which are also backbone-fragile. We\nsuggest that the decay in cost beyond the satisfiability threshold is due to\nincreasing backbone robustness (the opposite of backbone fragility). Our\nhypothesis makes three correct predictions. First, that the backbone robustness\nof an instance is negatively correlated with the local search cost when other\nfactors are controlled for. Second, that backbone-minimal instances (which are\n3-SAT instances altered so as to be more backbone-fragile) are unusually hard\nfor WSat.

It makes two new contributions. First,\nit formally defines and discusses two different goal orderings, which are\ncalled the reasonable and the forced ordering. Both orderings are defined for\nsimple STRIPS operators as well as for more complex ADL operators supporting\nnegation and conditional effects. The complexity of these orderings is\ninvestigated and their practical relevance is discussed. Secondly, two\ndifferent methods to compute reasonable goal orderings are developed. One of\nthem is based on planning graphs, while the other investigates the set of\nactions directly. Finally, it is shown how the ordering relations, which have\nbeen derived for a given set of goals G, can be used to compute a so-called\ngoal agenda that divides G into an ordered set of subgoals. Any planner can\nthen, in principle, use the goal agenda to plan for increasing sets of\nsubgoals. This can lead to an exponential complexity reduction, as the solution\nto a complex planning problem is found by solving easier subproblems.

At first blush, these three requirements seem\ncontradictory. For example, adaptation risks introducing undesirable side\neffects, thereby making agents' behavior less predictable. Furthermore,\nalthough formal verification can assist in ensuring behavioral predictability,\nit is known to be time-consuming. Our solution to the challenge of satisfying\nall three requirements is the following. Agents have finite-state automaton\nplans, which are adapted online via evolutionary learning (perturbation)\noperators. To ensure that critical behavioral constraints are always satisfied,\nagents' plans are first formally verified. They are then reverified after every\nadaptation. If reverification concludes that constraints are violated, the\nplans are repaired. The main objective of this paper is to improve the\nefficiency of reverification after learning, so that agents have a sufficiently\nrapid response time. We present two solutions: positive results that certain\nlearning operators are a priori guaranteed to preserve useful classes of\nbehavioral assurance constraints (which implies that no reverification is\nneeded for these operators), and efficient incremental reverification\nalgorithms for those learning operators that have negative a priori results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 16:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-02"}

The algorithm is\nbased on a breadth-first, backward search, and returns conformant plans of\nminimal length, if a solution to the planning problem exists, otherwise it\nterminates concluding that the problem admits no conformant solution. Second,\nwe provide a symbolic representation of the search space based on Binary\nDecision Diagrams (BDDs), which is the basis for search techniques derived from\nsymbolic model checking. The symbolic representation makes it possible to\nanalyze potentially large sets of states and transitions in a single\ncomputation step, thus providing for an efficient implementation. Third, we\npresent CMBP (Conformant Model Based Planner), an efficient implementation of\nthe data structures and algorithm described above, directly based on BDD\nmanipulations, which allows for a compact representation of the search layers\nand an efficient implementation of the search steps. Finally, we present an\nexperimental comparison of our approach with the state-of-the-art conformant\nplanners CGP, QBFPLAN and GPT. Our analysis includes all the planning problems\nfrom the distribution packages of these systems, plus other problems defined to\nstress a number of specific factors. Our approach appears to be the most\neffective: CMBP is strictly more expressive than QBFPLAN and CGP and, in all\nthe problems where a comparison is possible, CMBP outperforms its competitors,\nsometimes by orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 16:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-02"}

To address\nthis problem, we propose an adaptive importance sampling algorithm, AIS-BN,\nthat shows promising convergence rates even under extreme conditions and seems\nto outperform the existing sampling algorithms consistently. Three sources of\nthis performance improvement are (1) two heuristics for initialization of the\nimportance function that are based on the theoretical properties of importance\nsampling in finite-dimensional integrals and the structural advantages of\nBayesian networks, (2) a smooth learning method for the importance function,\nand (3) a dynamic weighting function for combining samples from different\nstages of the algorithm. We tested the performance of the AIS-BN algorithm\nalong with two state of the art general purpose sampling algorithms, likelihood\nweighting (Fung and Chang, 1989; Shachter and Peot, 1989) and self-importance\nsampling (Shachter and Peot, 1989). We used in our tests three large real\nBayesian network models available to the scientific community: the CPCS network\n(Pradhan et al., 1994), the PathFinder network (Heckerman, Horvitz, and\nNathwani, 1990), and the ANDES network (Conati, Gertner, VanLehn, and Druzdzel,\n1997), with evidence as unlikely as 10^-41. While the AIS-BN algorithm always\nperformed better than the other two algorithms, in the majority of the test\ncases it achieved orders of magnitude improvement in precision of the results.\nImprovement in speed given a desired precision is even more dramatic, although\nwe are unable to report numerical results here, as the other algorithms almost\nnever achieved the precision reached even by the first few iterations of the\nAIS-BN algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 16:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-02"}

The techniques for\nimproving backtracking algorithms can be conveniently classified as look-ahead\nschemes and look-back schemes. Unfortunately, look-ahead and look-back schemes\nare not entirely orthogonal as it has been observed empirically that the\nenhancement of look-ahead techniques is sometimes counterproductive to the\neffects of look-back techniques. In this paper, we focus on the relationship\nbetween the two most important look-ahead techniques---using a variable\nordering heuristic and maintaining a level of local consistency during the\nbacktracking search---and the look-back technique of conflict-directed\nbackjumping (CBJ). We show that there exists a \"perfect\" dynamic variable\nordering such that CBJ becomes redundant. We also show theoretically that as\nthe level of local consistency that is maintained in the backtracking search is\nincreased, the less that backjumping will be an improvement. Our theoretical\nresults partially explain why a backtracking algorithm doing more in the\nlook-ahead phase cannot benefit more from the backjumping look-back scheme.\nFinally, we show empirically that adding CBJ to a backtracking algorithm that\nmaintains generalized arc consistency (GAC), an algorithm that we refer to as\nGAC-CBJ, can still provide orders of magnitude speedups. Our empirical results\ncontrast with Bessiere and Regin's conclusion (1996) that CBJ is useless to an\nalgorithm that maintains arc consistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 16:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-02"}

First, while Bagging is almost always more accurate than a single\nclassifier, it is sometimes much less accurate than Boosting. On the other\nhand, Boosting can create ensembles that are less accurate than a single\nclassifier -- especially when using neural networks. Analysis indicates that\nthe performance of the Boosting methods is dependent on the characteristics of\nthe data set being examined. In fact, further results show that Boosting\nensembles may overfit noisy data sets, thus decreasing its performance.\nFinally, consistent with previous studies, our work suggests that most of the\ngain in an ensemble's performance comes in the first few classifiers combined;\nhowever, relatively large gains can be seen up to 25 classifiers when Boosting\ndecision trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 16:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-02"}

Addressing these\nissues of social networks has recently become possible through large scale data\nanalysis of e.g. mobile phone call records, which has revealed the existence of\nmodular or community structure with many links between nodes of the same\ncommunity and relatively few links between nodes of different communities. The\nweights of links, e.g. the number of calls between two users, and the network\ntopology are found correlated such that intra-community links are stronger\ncompared to the weak inter-community links. This is known as Granovetter's \"The\nstrength of weak ties\" hypothesis. In addition to this inhomogeneous community\nstructure, the temporal patterns of human dynamics turn out to be inhomogeneous\nor bursty, characterized by the heavy tailed distribution of inter-event time\nbetween two consecutive events. In this paper, we study how the community\nstructure and the bursty dynamics emerge together in an evolving weighted\nnetwork model. The principal mechanisms behind these patterns are social\ninteraction by cyclic closure, i.e. links to friends of friends and the focal\nclosure, i.e. links to individuals sharing similar attributes or interests, and\nhuman dynamics by task handling process. These three mechanisms have been\nimplemented as a network model with local attachment, global attachment, and\npriority-based queuing processes. By comprehensive numerical simulations we\nshow that the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the emergence of heavy\ntailed inter-event time distribution and the evolution of Granovetter-type\ncommunity structure. Moreover, the numerical results are found to be in\nqualitative agreement with empirical results from mobile phone call dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 19:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-26"}

We study the impact of this effect on\nthe star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent\nstar formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the\nevolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect\nof metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark\nhalos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for\nhalos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch\nup with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall\ntime, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in\neach galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated\ncosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z\nmakes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that\nthe specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas\nat high z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional\nfuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows\nthe SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow\nrate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the\nuniversal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the\nexpected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a\ngiven z, and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat\nand rising respectively.

Our original model consisted of two graphene plates with attached\npolar headgroups; the plates were immersed in a water bath. The interaction\nbetween such plates can be considered as an example of a hydrophilic\ninteraction. In the present work we modify our previous model by removing the\ncharge from the zwitterionic headgroups. As a result of this procedure, the\nplate character changes; it becomes hydrophobic. By separating the total\ninteraction (or potential of mean force, PMF) between plates into the direct\nand the water-mediated interactions we observe that the latter changes from\nrepulsive to attractive, clearly emphasizing the important role of water as a\nmedium. We also investigate the effect of roughness and flexibility of the\nheadgroups on the interaction between plates and observe that roughness\nenhances the character of the hydrophobic interaction. The presence of a\ndewetting transition in a confined space between charge-removed plates confirms\nthat the interaction between plates is strongly hydrophobic. In addition, we\nnotice that there is a shallow local minimum in the PMF in case of\ncharge-removed plates. We find that this minimum is associated with the\nconfigurational changes that flexible headgroups undergo, as the two plates are\nbrought together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 20:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-03"}

The particular generalized t distribution we adopt is a\nStudent distribution on the absolute value of its argument. For low degrees of\nfreedom we show that the generalized t exhibits 'sparsity-prior' properties\nwith some attractive features over other common forms of sparse priors and\nincludes the well known double-exponential distribution as the degrees of\nfreedom tends to infinity. We pay particular attention to graphical\nrepresentations of posterior statistics obtained from sparsity-path-analysis\n(SPA) where we sweep over the setting of the scale (shrinkage / precision)\nparameter in the prior to explore the space of posterior models obtained over a\nrange of complexities, from very sparse models with all coefficient\ndistributions heavily concentrated around zero, to models with diffuse priors\nand coefficients distributed around their maximum likelihood estimates. The SPA\nplots are akin to LASSO plots of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates but they\ncharacterise the complete marginal posterior distributions of the coefficients\nplotted as a function of the precision of the prior. Generating posterior\ndistributions over a range of prior precisions is computationally challenging\nbut naturally amenable to sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms indexed on\nthe scale parameter.

The global SF is depleted with a rise of the\nrepulsion between the bosons, yet at very strong interaction superfluidity is\nstill present. The global CF remains almost constant with increasing HC\nrepulsion.

No bright\nsources were detected in the XIS field of view (FOV) except for two faint\npoint-like sources. The two sources, however, are considered not to be related\nto HESS J1702-420, because their fluxes in the 2-10 keV band (~ 10^-14 erg s^-1\ncm^-2) are ~ 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the VHE gamma-ray flux in the\n1-10 TeV band (F_{TeV} = 3.1 x 10^-11 erg s^-1 cm^-2). We compared the energy\nspectrum of diffuse emission, extracted from the entire XIS FOV with those from\nnearby observations. If we consider the systematic error of background\nsubtraction, no significant diffuse emission was detected with an upper limit\nof F_X <2.7 x 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the 2-10 keV band for an assumed\npower-law spectrum of \\Gamma=2.1 and a source size same as that in the VHE\nband. The upper limit of the X-ray flux is twelve times as small as the VHE\ngamma-ray flux. The large flux ratio (F_{TeV}/F_X) indicates that HESS\nJ1702-420 is another example of a \"dark\" particle accelerator. If we use a\nsimple one-zone leptonic model, in which VHE gamma-rays are produced through\ninverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background and interstellar\nfar-infrared emission, and the X-rays via the synchrotron mechanism, an upper\nlimit of the magnetic field (1.7 \\mu G) is obtained from the flux ratio.\nBecause the magnetic field is weaker than the typical value in the Galactic\nplane (3-10 \\mu G), the simple one-zone model may not work for HESS J1702-420\nand a significant fraction of the VHE gamma-rays may originate from protons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 07:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Also for nuclei from\n$^{76}$Ge to $^{238}$U, the bivariate correlation coefficient is found to vary\nfrom $\\sim 0.6 - 0.8$ and these values can be used as a starting point for\ncalculating nuclear transition matrix elements using the spectral distribution\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 10:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-03"}

Two new features are shown to appear: 1) information is flowing to\nthe measuring device both from the past and from the future; 2)because of the\npost-selection, certain measurement outcomes can be forced never to occur.

The SED shows a significant IR excess at wavelengths greater than\n$\\sim5 \\mu$. We conclude that CoRoT\\,102699796 is a young Herbig Ae (F1Ve) star\nwith a transitional disk, likely associated to the HII region [FT96]213.1-2.2.\n  The pulsation frequencies have been interpreted in the light of the\nnon-radial pulsation theory, using the LOSC code in conjunction with static and\nrotational evolutionary tracks. A minimization algorithm was used to find the\nbest-fit model with M=1.84 M$_{\\odot}$, T$_{\\rm eff}$=6900 K which imply an\nisochronal age of t$\\sim$2.5 Myr. This result is based on the interpretation of\nthe detected frequencies as $g$-modes of low-moderate $n$-value.

Since CoRoT\\,102699796 lies in the region\nof the HR diagram where the $\\delta$ Sct and $\\gamma$ Dor instability strips\nintersect, we argue that the observed pulsation characteristics are\nintermediate between these classes of variables, i.e. CoRoT\\,102699796 is\nlikely the first PMS hybrid $\\gamma$ Dor-$\\delta$ Sct pulsator ever studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 12:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The algorithm is based on multivariate\npolynomial interpolation and root-finding over extension fields. It was noted\nby Vadhan that interpolating a linear polynomial suffices if one settles for a\nsmaller decoding radius (but still enough for a statement of the above form).\nHere we give a simple linear-algebra based analysis of this variant that\neliminates the need for the computationally expensive root-finding step over\nextension fields (and indeed any mention of extension fields). The entire list\ndecoding algorithm is linear-algebraic, solving one linear system for the\ninterpolation step, and another linear system to find a small subspace of\ncandidate solutions. Except for the step of pruning this subspace, the\nalgorithm can be implemented to run in {\\em quadratic} time. The theoretical\ndrawback of folded RS codes are that both the decoding complexity and proven\nworst-case list-size bound are $n^{\\Omega(1/\\eps)}$. By combining the above\nidea with a pseudorandom subset of all polynomials as messages, we get a Monte\nCarlo construction achieving a list size bound of $O(1/\\eps^2)$ which is quite\nclose to the existential $O(1/\\eps)$ bound (however, the decoding complexity\nremains $n^{\\Omega(1/\\eps)}$).

It\nprovides the benefits of parallel receive processing in multiprocessing\nenvironments. However, existing RSS-enabled NICs lack a critical data steering\nmechanism that would automatically steer incoming network data to the same core\non which its application process resides. This absence causes inefficient cache\nusage if an application is not running on the core on which RSS has scheduled\nthe received traffic to be processed. In Linux systems, it cannot even ensure\nthat packets in a TCP flow are processed by a single core, even if the\ninterrupts for the flow are pinned to a specific core. This results in degraded\nperformance. In this paper, we develop such a data steering mechanism in the\nNIC for multicore or multiprocessor systems. This data steering mechanism is\nmainly targeted at TCP, but it can be extended to other transport layer\nprotocols.

The linear theory has been well understood for some time, however\ndeveloping and applying the theory beyond linear order is currently at the\nforefront of research in theoretical cosmology. This thesis studies the\napplications of perturbation theory to cosmology and, specifically, to the\nearly universe. Starting with some background material introducing the\nwell-tested 'standard model' of cosmology, we move on to develop the formalism\nfor perturbation theory up to second order giving evolution equations for all\ntypes of scalar, vector and tensor perturbations, both in gauge dependent and\ngauge invariant form. We then move on to the main result of the thesis, showing\nthat, at second order in perturbation theory, vorticity is sourced by a\ncoupling term quadratic in energy density and entropy perturbations. This\nsource term implies a qualitative difference to linear order. Thus, while at\nlinear order vorticity decays with the expansion of the universe, the same is\nnot true at higher orders. This will have important implications on future\nmeasurements of the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and could\ngive rise to the generation of a primordial seed magnetic field. Having derived\nthis qualitative result, we then estimate the scale dependence and magnitude of\nthe vorticity power spectrum, finding, for simple power law inputs a small,\nblue spectrum. The final part of this thesis concerns higher order perturbation\ntheory, deriving, for the first time, the metric tensor, gauge transformation\nrules and governing equations for fully general third order perturbations.

In this context, the\ndirect problem is predicting the potentially time-varying magnetizations. The\nthree theories include the first and second order Plefka expansions, referred\nto as naive mean field (nMF) and TAP, respectively, and a mean field theory\nwhich is exact for fully asymmetric couplings. We call the last of these simply\nMF theory. We show that for the direct problem, nMF performs worse than the\nother two approximations, TAP outperforms MF when the coupling matrix is nearly\nsymmetric, while MF works better when it is strongly asymmetric. For the\ninverse problem, MF performs better than both TAP and nMF, although an ad hoc\nadjustment of TAP can make it comparable to MF. For high temperatures the\nperformance of TAP and MF approach each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 15:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-20"}
