However, no planets have been found inside\n0.6 AU around clump giants, in contrast to solar-type main-sequence stars, many\nof which harbor short-period planets such as hot Jupiters. In this study we\nexamine the possibility that planets were engulfed by host stars evolving on\nthe red-giant branch (RGB). We integrate the orbital evolution of planets in\nthe RGB and helium burning (HeB) phases of host stars, including the effects of\nstellar tide and stellar mass loss. Then we derive the critical semimajor axis\n(or the survival limit) inside which planets are eventually engulfed by their\nhost stars after tidal decay of their orbits. Especially, we investigate the\nimpact of stellar mass and other stellar parameters on the survival limit in\nmore detail than previous studies. In addition, we make detailed comparison\nwith measured semimajor axes of planets detected so far, which no previous\nstudy did. We find that the critical semimajor axis is quite sensitive to\nstellar mass in the range between 1.7 and 2.1 Msun, which suggests a need for\ncareful comparison between theoretical and observational limits of existence of\nplanets. Our comparison demonstrates that all those planets are beyond the\nsurvival limit, which is consistent with the planet-engulfment hypothesis.\nHowever, on the high-mass side (> 2.1 Msun), the detected planets are orbiting\nsignificantly far from the survival limit, which suggests that engulfment by\nhost stars may not be the main reason for the observed lack of short-period\ngiant planets. To confirm our conclusion, the detection of more planets around\nclump giants, especially with masses > 2.5 Msun, is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2011 16:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-09"}

It is well known that this is accomplished in a most\nnatural way when the matter theory is formulated as a relativistic, Lagrangian\nfield theory. Special matter models of this type have been available; here a\nthermodynamical model that allows for general flows is used. A problem that is\nof even older date, one that was pursued vigorously by leading scientists of\nthe 19'th century, is that of subjecting hydrodynamics and thermodynamics to an\nAction Principle. A solution to this problem has been known for some time, but\nonly under the strong restriction to potential flows.\n  A variational principle for general flows has now become available.\n  The present paper lifts this theory to the relativistic context, Special\nRelativity and General Relativity. The energy momentum tensor has a structure\nthat is more general than that postulated by Tolman, and different from\nproposed generalizations; it appears to be well suited to represent rotational\nflows in General Relativity. It incorporates a conserved mass current, the\nrelativistic analogue of the hydrodynamical equation of continuity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2011 01:51:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2012 21:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 07:44:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 17:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 13:58:02 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 17:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

Certainly the current\nsearch engines (such as Google, Bing and Yahoo) offer an efficient way to\nbrowse the web content. However, the result quality is highly based on uses\nqueries which need to be more precise to find relevant documents. This task\nstill complicated for the majority of inept users who cannot express their\nneeds with significant words in the query. For that reason, we believe that a\nreformulation of the initial user's query can be a good alternative to improve\nthe information selectivity. This study proposes a novel approach and presents\na prototype system called PRESY (Profile-based REformulation SYstem) for\ninformation retrieval on the web. Approach: It uses an incremental approach to\ncategorize users by constructing a contextual base. The latter is composed of\ntwo types of context (static and dynamic) obtained using the users' profiles.\nThe architecture proposed was implemented using .Net environment to perform\nqueries reformulating tests. Results: The experiments gives at the end of this\narticle show that the precision of the returned content is effectively\nimproved. The tests were performed with the most popular searching engine (i.e.\nGoogle, Bind and Yahoo) selected in particular for their high selectivity.\nAmong the given results, we found that query reformulation improve the first\nthree results by 10.7% and 11.7% of the next seven returned elements. So as we\ncan see the reformulation of users' initial queries improves the pertinence of\nreturned content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2011 08:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-14"}

FTFA problem in \\cite{shihongftfa}). In the problem, we are\ngiven a set of sites equipped with an unconstrained number of facilities as\nresources, and a set of clients with set $\\mathcal{R}$ as corresponding\nconnection requirements, where every facility belonging to the same site has an\nidentical opening (operating) cost and every client-facility pair has a\nconnection cost. The objective is to allocate facilities from sites to satisfy\n$\\mathcal{R}$ at a minimum total cost. Next, we introduce the Constrained\nFault-Tolerant Resource Allocation (CFTRA) problem. It differs from UFTRA in\nthat the number of resources available at each site $i$ is limited by $R_{i}$.\nBoth problems are practical extensions of the classical Fault-Tolerant Facility\nLocation (FTFL) problem \\cite{Jain00FTFL}. For instance, their solutions\nprovide optimal resource allocation (w.r.t. enterprises) and leasing (w.r.t.\nclients) strategies for the contemporary cloud platforms.\n  In this paper, we consider the metric version of the problems. For UFTRA with\nuniform $\\mathcal{R}$, we present a star-greedy algorithm. The algorithm\nachieves the approximation ratio of 1.5186 after combining with the cost\nscaling and greedy augmentation techniques similar to\n\\cite{Charikar051.7281.853,Mahdian021.52}, which significantly improves the\nresult of \\cite{shihongftfa} using a phase-greedy algorithm. We also study the\ncapacitated extension of UFTRA and give a factor of 2.89. For CFTRA with\nuniform $\\mathcal{R}$, we slightly modify the algorithm to achieve\n1.5186-approximation. For a more general version of CFTRA, we show that it is\nreducible to FTFL using linear programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2011 08:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-14"}

A single gene with negative transcriptional\nfeedback needs a time delay and sufficiently strong nonlinearity in the\ntransmission of the feedback signal in order to produce biochemical rhythms. A\nsingle gene with only positive transcriptional feedback does not produce\noscillations. Here, we demonstrate that this single-gene network in conjunction\nwith a simple negative interaction can also easily produce rhythms. We examine\na model comprised of two well-differentiated parts. The first is a positive\nfeedback created by a protein that binds to the promoter of its own gene and\nactivates the transcription. The second is a negative interaction in which a\nrepressor molecule prevents this protein from binding to its promoter. A\nstochastic study shows that the system is robust to noise. A deterministic\nstudy identifies that the dynamics of the oscillator are mainly driven by two\ntypes of biomolecules: the protein, and the complex formed by the repressor and\nthis protein. The main conclusion of this paper is that a simple and usual\nnegative interaction, such as degradation, sequestration or inhibition, acting\non the positive transcriptional feedback of a single gene is a sufficient\ncondition to produce reliable oscillations. One gene is enough and the positive\ntranscriptional feedback signal does not need to activate a second repressor\ngene. This means that at the genetic level an explicit negative feedback loop\nis not necessary. The model needs neither cooperative binding reactions nor the\nformation of protein multimers.
