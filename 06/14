These have been attributed to their\nformation in a metallic core, approximately 150 km in radius, that cooled to\ncrystallization in the absence of any appreciable insulating mantle. Here we\nbuild upon this formation model by incorporating several new constraints. These\ninclude (i) a recent U-Pb radiometric closure age of <2.5 Myr after solar\nsystem formation for the group IVA iron Muonionalusta, (ii) new measurements\nand modeling of highly siderophile element compositions for a suite of IVAs,\nand (iii) consideration of the thermal effects of heating by the decay of the\nshort-lived radionuclide 60Fe. Our model for the thermal evolution of the IVA\ncore suggests that it was approximately 50 - 110 km in radius after being\ncollisionally exposed. This range is due to uncertainties in the initial\nabundance of live 60Fe incorporated into the IVA core. Our models define a\nrelationship between cooling rate and closure age, which is used to make\nseveral predictions that can be tested with future measurements. In general,\nour results show that diverse cooling rates and early U-Pb closure ages can\nonly coexist on mantle-free bodies and that energy released by the decay of\n60Fe reduces the core size necessary to produce diverse metallographic cooling\nrates. The influence of 60Fe on cooling rates has largely been neglected in\nprevious core formation models; accounting for this heat source can affect size\nestimates for other iron meteorite cores that cooled to crystallization in the\npresence of live 60Fe. Candidates for such a scenario of early, mantle-free\nformation include the iron IIAB, IIIAB and IVB groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 16:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We study a more realistic setting in which (a) the principal is a\ndecision maker and will take a decision based on the expert's prediction; and\n(b) the expert has an inherent interest in the decision. For example, in a\ncorporate decision market, the expert may derive different levels of utility\nfrom the actions taken by her manager.

When\ncombined with the expert's inherent utility for decisions, a compensation rule\ninduces a net scoring rule that behaves like a normal scoring rule. Assuming\nfull knowledge of expert utility, we provide a complete characterization of all\n(strictly) proper compensation rules.

This postulate forces the introduction of four\nadditional degrees of freedom into the space-time structure whose\ntransformation properties are defined to preserve the local properties of time\nunder arbitrary four-dimensional coordinate transformations. We identify these\nadditional degrees of freedom with the electromagnetic potentials, which\nthereby acquire a space-time interpretation.

The distance to the source,\nits transient nature, and high internal column density serve to complicate\nseveral means of estimating the mass of the black hole. Utilizing newly-refined\nrelationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity,\nand de-beaming the source flux, a weak constraint on the black hole mass is\nobtained: log(M/Msun) = 5.5 +/- 1.1 (1 sigma confidence). The confidence\ninterval is determined from the current intrinsic scatter in the relation,\nwhich includes effects from X-ray variability and accretion modes. This mass\nrange is broad, but it includes low values that are consistent with some\nvariability arguments, and it safely excludes high mass values where it becomes\nimpossible for black holes to disrupt stars. Future refinements in\nrelationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity\nwill be able to reduce the uncertainty in related mass estimates by a factor of\ntwo, making this technique comparable to estimates based on the M-sigma\nrelationship. Possible difficulties in placing such events on the fundamental\nplane, a potential future test of their suitability, and uncertainties in mass\nstemming from variable X-ray emission are discussed. As near and longer-term\nsurvey efforts such as Pan-STARRS, LSST, LOFAR, the Square Kilometer Array, and\neROSITA begin to detect many tidal disruption events, black hole mass estimates\nfrom combined X-ray and radio observations may prove to be very pragmatic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 17:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 15:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This effect arises because the number and energy of\nhydrogen bonds that a water molecule forms near a hydrophobic surface differ\nfrom their bulk values. Such an alteration gives rise to a hydrogen bond\ncontribution to the external potential field whereto a water molecule is\nsubjected in that vicinity. This contribution is shown to play a dominant role\nin the interaction of a water molecule with the surface. Our approach predicts\nthat the free energy of hydration of a planar hydrophobic surface in a model\nliquid water decreases with increasing temperature in the range from 293 K to\n333 K. This result is indirectly supported by the counter-intuitive\nexperimental observation that under some conditions the hydration of a\nmolecular hydrophobe is entropically favorable as well as by the molecular\ndynamics simulations predicting positive hydration entropy for sufficiently\nlarge (nanoscale) hydrophobes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 19:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 12:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-16"}

However, the combination of 2MASS near-infrared (NIR) and\nSpitzer-IRAC mid-infrared (MIR) photometry enables a powerful method for\ndetermining the line of sight reddening to any star: the sampled wavelengths\nlie in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution of most\nstars, where, to first order, all stars have essentially the same intrinsic\ncolor. Thus, changes in stellar NIR-MIR colors due to interstellar reddening\nare readily apparent, and (under an assumed extinction law) the observed colors\nand magnitudes of stars can be easily and accurately restored to their\nintrinsic values, greatly increasing their usefulness for Galactic structure\nstudies. In this paper we explore this \"Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess\" (RJCE)\nmethod and demonstrate that use of even a simple variant of the RJCE method\nbased on a single reference color, (H-[4.5um]), can rather accurately remove\ndust effects from previously uninterpretable 2MASS color-magnitude diagrams of\nstars in fields along the heavily reddened Galactic mid-plane, with results far\nsuperior to those derived from application of other dereddening methods. We\nalso show that \"total\" Galactic midplane extinction looks rather different from\nthat predicted using 100um emission maps from the IRAS/ISSA and COBE/DIRBE\ninstruments as presented by Schlegel et al. Instead, the Galactic mid-plane\nextinction strongly resembles the distribution of 13-CO (J=1->0) emission.\nFuture papers will focus on refining the RJCE method and applying the technique\nto understand better not only dust and its distribution, but the distribution\nof stars intermixed with the dust in the low-latitude Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The fraction of centrals that are\nred does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses,\nwhereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite\nquenching efficiency, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched\nupon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent\nof stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity. The red fraction\nof satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity, a measure of\nlocation within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e. dark\nmatter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local\ndensity and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the halo mass gives\nclues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show\nthat the action of mass-quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of\nthe DM mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al (2010) approach to\npredict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into\npassive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed\nmass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this\nphenomenological approach.

For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected\nwith ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting\nupper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two\nsystems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.\nBecause WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the\nmost probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is\nviewed nearly pole-on. This implies the WASP-1 star has a high obliquity with\nrespect to the edge-on planetary orbit.

Recently, a closure\nphase of 0+-40 degrees was reported on a triangle of Earth-sized baselines\n(SMT-CARMA-JCMT) representing a new constraint upon the structure and\norientation of the emission region, independent from those provided by the\npreviously measured 1.3mm-VLBI visibility amplitudes alone. Here, we compare\nthis to the closure phases associated with a class of physically motivated,\nradiatively inefficient accretion flow models, and present predictions for\nfuture mm-VLBI experiments with the developing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).\nWe find that the accretion flow models are capable of producing a wide variety\nof closure phases on the SMT-CARMA-JCMT triangle, and thus not all models are\nconsistent with the recent observations.

We limit our calculation\nto cases where the post breakout acceleration of the gas ends during the planar\nphase. (i.e., the final gas Lorentz factor <~30). We find that spherical\nrelativistic breakouts produce a flash of gamma-rays with energy, temperature,\nand duration that always satisfy a specific relation between them as well as\nproviding the breakout radius and Lorentz factor. The breakout flare is\ntypically followed, on longer time scales, by X-rays that carry a comparable\nenergy.

It remains a question what the minimally required description for\nthe surrounding of such an open driven system is, so that its nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics can be established solely based on the internal stochastic\nkinetics. We provide a solution to this problem using insights from studies of\nmolecular motors in a chemical nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) with\nsustained external drive through a regenerating system, or in a quasi-steady\nstate (QSS) with an excess amount of ATP, ADP, and Pi.

Using a Markov\n(master-equation) description of a motor protein, we illustrate that the NESS\nand QSS have identical kinetics as well as the Second Law in terms of a same\npositive entropy production rate. The difference between the heat dissipation\nof a NESS and its corresponding QSS is exactly the $W_{min}$. This provides a\njustification for introducing an {\\em ideal external regenerating system} and\nyields a {\\em free energy balance equation} between the net free energy input\n$F_{in}$ and total dissipation $F_{dis}$ in an NESS: $F_{in}$ consists of\nchemical input minus mechanical output; $F_{dis}$ consists of dissipative heat;\nand the amount of useful energy becoming heat is the NESS entropy production.\nFurthermore, we show that for non-stationary systems, the $F_{dis}$ and\n$F_{in}$ correspond to the entropy production rate and housekeeping heat in\nstochastic thermodynamics, and identify a relative entropy $H$ as a generalized\nfree energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 21:17:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 03:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 05:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}

The basic pattern is that several\ndifferent quirky states can be produced, some of which beta-decay during or\nafter spin-down, leaving the lightest electrically neutral quirks to hadronize\ninto a meson that subsequently decays into gluon jets.

Two kinds of broad emission line region (BELR) models\nhave been proposed, outflow and gravitationally bound BELR, which are supported\nrespectively by blueshift of the CIV line and reverberation mapping\nobservations. To reconcile these two apparently different models, we present a\ndetailed comparison study between the CIV and MgII lines using a sample of AGNs\nselected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the kinematics of the\nCIV region is different from that of MgII, which is thought to be controlled by\ngravity. A strong correlation is found between the blueshift and asymmetry of\nthe CIV profile and the Eddington ratio. This provides strong observational\nsupport for the postulation that the outflow is driven by radiation pressure.\nIn particular, we find robust evidence that the CIV line region is largely\ndominated by outflow at high Eddington ratios, while it is primarily\ngravitationally bounded at low Eddington ratios. Our results indicate that\nthese two emitting regions coexist in most of AGNs. The emission strength from\nthese two gases varies smoothly with Eddington ratio in opposite ways. This\nexplanation naturally reconciles the apparently contradictory views proposed in\nprevious studies. Finally, candidate models are discussed which can account for\nboth, the enhancement of outflow emission and suppression of normal BEL, in AGN\nwith high Eddington ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 00:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Transitions between the two implies that the discs may be\nwarped and precessing. Type II X-ray outbursts are thought to occur when the\nwarped disc interacts with the fast stellar wind. We suggest that tides from a\nmisaligned companion neutron star can cause the observed effects. We make\nnumerical models of a Be star decretion disc in which the spin of the Be star\nis misaligned with the orbital axis of a neutron star companion. Tidal torques\nfrom the neutron star truncate the disc at a radius small enough that the\nneutron star orbit does not intersect the disc unless the eccentricity or\nmisalignment is very large. A magnetic torque from the Be star that is largest\nat the equator, where the rotation is fastest, is approximated by an inner\nboundary condition. There are large oscillations in the mass and inclination of\nthe disc as it moves towards a steady state. These large variations may explain\nthe observed changes from Be star to Be shell star and vice-versa and also the\nType II X-ray outbursts. We find the tidal timescale on which the disc warps,\nprecesses and reaches a steady state to be around a year up to a few hundred\nyears. If present, the oscillations in mass and disc inclination occur on a\nfraction of this timescale depending on the orbital parameters of the binary.\nThe timescales associated with the tidal torque for observed Be star binaries\nsuggest that these effects are important in all but the longest period\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 01:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A major limitation of this approach is\nthe large computational memory space requirement to construct the de Bruijn\ngraph, which scales with k-mer length and total diversity (N) of unique k-mers\nin the genome expressed in base pairs or roughly (2k+8)N bits. This limitation\nis particularly important with large-scale genome analysis and for sequencing\ncenters that simultaneously process multiple genomes. We present a sparse de\nBruijn graph structure, based on which we developed SparseAssembler that\ngreatly reduces memory space requirements. The structure also allows us to\nintroduce a novel method for the removal of substitution errors introduced\nduring sequencing. The sparse de Bruijn graph structure skips g intermediate\nk-mers, therefore reducing the theoretical memory space requirement to\n~(2k/g+8)N. We have found that a practical value of g=16 consumes approximately\n10% of the memory required by standard de Bruijn graph-based algorithms but\nyields comparable results. A high error rate could potentially derail the\nSparseAssembler. Therefore, we developed a sparse de Bruijn graph-based\ndenoising algorithm that can remove more than 99% of substitution errors from\ndatasets with a \\leq 2% error rate. Given that substitution error rates for the\ncurrent generation of sequencers is lower than 1%, our denoising procedure is\nsufficiently effective to safeguard the performance of our algorithm.

A realistic magnetic field of moderate strength has\nbeen shown to suppress, through catastrophic magnetic braking, the formation of\na rotationally supported disk during the protostellar accretion phase of\nlow-mass star formation in the ideal MHD limit. We address, through 2D\n(axisymmetric) simulations, the question of whether realistic levels of\nnonideal effects, computed with a simplified chemical network including dust\ngrains, can weaken the magnetic braking enough to enable a rotationally\nsupported disk to form. We find that ambipolar diffusion, the dominant nonideal\nMHD effect over most of the density range relevant to disk formation, does not\nenable disk formation, at least in 2D. The reason is that ambipolar diffusion\nallows the magnetic flux that would be dragged into the central stellar object\nin the ideal MHD limit to pile up instead in a small circumstellar region,\nwhere the magnetic field strength (and thus the braking efficiency) is greatly\nenhanced. We also find that, on the scale of tens of AU or more, a realistic\nlevel of Ohmic dissipation does not weaken the magnetic braking enough for a\nrotationally supported disk to form, either by itself or in combination with\nambipolar diffusion. The Hall effect, the least explored of these three\nnonideal MHD effects, can spin up the material close to the central object to a\nsignificant, supersonic rotation speed, even when the core is initially\nnon-rotating, although the spun-up material remains too sub-Keplerian to form a\nrotationally supported disk. The problem of catastrophic magnetic braking that\nprevents disk formation in dense cores magnetized to realistic levels remains\nunresolved.

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope. In\nthis paper, we have demonstrated that envelope pollution in general lowers the\ncritical core masses and hastens gas accretion on to the protoplanet because of\nthe increase in the molecular weight and reduction of adiabatic temperature\ngradient. Widely- and highly-polluted envelopes allow smaller cores to form\nmassive envelopes before disc dissipation.

The observed\nanisotropies are small, so accurate measurements require small statistical\nuncertainties, i.e. large datasets. These can be obtained by employing ground\ndetector arrays with large extensions (from 10^4 to 10^9 m^2) and long\noperation time (up to 20 years). The control of such arrays is challenging and\nspurious variations in the counting rate due to instrumental effects (e.g. data\ntaking interruptions or changes in the acceptance) and atmospheric effects\n(e.g. air temperature and pressure effects on EAS development) are usually\npresent. These modulations must be corrected very precisely before performing\nstandard anisotropy analyses, i.e. harmonic analysis of the counting rate\nversus local sidereal time. In this paper we discuss an alternative method to\nmeasure large scale anisotropies, the \"East-West method\", originally proposed\nby Nagashima in 1989. It is a differential method, as it is based on the\nanalysis of the difference of the counting rates in the East and West\ndirections.

This definition has the same desirable\nproperties as the recently suggested dominant resource fairness, and also\nhandles the case of multiple bottlenecks. We then prove that a fair allocation\naccording to this definition is guaranteed to exist for any combination of user\nrequests and entitlements (where a user's relative use of the different\nresources is fixed).

The snow line migrates as the mass accretion rate (\\dot{M}) in the\ndisk decreases with time. Calculations are carried out from an early phase with\nhigh disk accretion rates (\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-7} M_sun/yr) to a later phase with\nlow disk accretion rates (\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-12} M_sun/yr) using the same\nnumerical method. It is found that the snow line moves inward for \\dot{M} >\n10^{-10} M_sun/yr, while it gradually moves outward in the later evolution\nphase with \\dot{M} < 10^{-10} M_sun/yr. In addition to the silicate opacity,\nthe ice opacity is taken into consideration. In the inward migration phase, the\nadditional ice opacity increases the distance of the snow line from the central\nstar by a factor of 1.3 for dust grains < 10 micro-meter in size and 1.6 for >\n100 micro-meter. It is inevitable that the snow line comes inside the Earth's\norbit in the course of the disk evolution, if the alpha viscosity parameter is\nin a range 0.001-0.1, the dust-to-gas mass ratio is higher than a tenth of the\nsolar abundance value, and the dust grains are smaller than 1 mm. The formation\nof water-devoid planetesimals in the terrestrial planet region seems to be\ndifficult throughout the disk evolution, which imposes a new challenge to\nplanet formation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 11:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

QIS-XML is a proposed\nframework, based on the widely used standard (XML) to describe, visualize,\nexchange and process quantum gates and quantum circuits. It also provides a\npotential approach to a generic programming language for quantum computers\nthrough the concept of XML driven compilers. Examples are provided for the\ndescription of commonly used quantum gates and circuits, accompanied with tools\nto visualize them in standard web browsers. An algorithmic example is also\npresented, performing a simple addition operation with quantum circuits and\nrunning the program on a quantum computer simulator. Overall, this initial\neffort demonstrates how XML technologies could be at the core of the\narchitecture for describing and programming quantum computers. By leveraging a\nwidely accepted standard, QIS-XML also builds a bridge between classic and\nquantum IT, which could foster the acceptance of QIS by the ICT community and\nfacilitate the understanding of quantum technology by IT experts. This would\nsupport the consolidation of Classic Information Science and Quantum\nInformation Science into a Complete Information Science, a challenge that could\nbe referred to as the \"Information Science Grand Unification Challenge\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 12:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-15"}

We observe an\nonion-like velocity structure in [FeII] in the blueshifted jet, similar to that\nobserved in optical lines. High-velocity gas at ~-200 km/s is collimated inside\na half-opening angle of 4 degrees and medium-velocity gas at ~-100 km/s in a\ncone with an half-opening angle 14 degrees. Two new axial jet knots are\ndetected in the blue jet, as well as a more distant bubble with corresponding\ncounter-bubble. The periodic knot ejection timescale is revised downward to 2.5\nyrs. The redshifted jet is detected only beyond 0.7\" from the star, yielding\nrevised constraints on the disk surface density. From comparison to [OI] data\nwe infer iron depletion of a factor 3 at high velocities and a factor 10 at\nspeeds below -100 km/s. The mass-fluxes in each of the medium and high-velocity\ncomponents of the blueshifted lobe are ~1.6+-0.8x10^-8 Msun/yr, representing\n0.02-0.2 of the disk accretion rate. The medium-velocity conical [FeII] flow in\nthe DG Tau jet is too fast and too narrow to trace photo-evaporated matter from\nthe disk atmosphere. Both its kinematics and collimation cannot be reproduced\nby the X-wind, nor can the \"conical magnetospheric wind\". The level of Fe gas\nphase depletion in the DG Tau medium-velocity component also rules out a\nstellar wind and a cocoon ejected sideways from the high-velocity beam. A\nquasi-steady centrifugal MHD disk wind ejected over 0.25-1.5 AU and/or episodic\nmagnetic tower cavities launched from the disk appear as the most plausible\norigins for the medium velocity component in the DG Tau jet.

Its best matching object and its\nstate estimated by the Kalman filter are combined to update position and size\nof the tracked object. However, the mobile object trajectories are usually\nfragmented because of occlusions and misdetections. Therefore, we also propose\na trajectory filtering, named global tracker, aims at removing the noisy\ntrajectories and fusing the fragmented trajectories belonging to a same mobile\nobject.

We present the investigation of magnetic-field\nvariations in the NOAA Active Region 8038 which was observed on the Sun during\n7--16 May 1997. Analyses of H{\\alpha} filtergrams and MDI/SOHO magnetograms\nrevealed continual but discrete surge activity, and emergence and cancellation\nof flux in this active region. The movie of these magnetograms revealed two\nimportant results that the major opposite polarities of pre-existing region as\nwell as in the emerging flux region (EFR) were approaching towards each other\nand moving magnetic features (MMF) were ejecting out from the major north\npolarity at a quasi-periodicity of about ten hrs during 10--13 May 1997. These\nactivities were probably caused by the magnetic reconnection in the lower\natmosphere driven by photospheric convergence motions, which were evident in\nmagnetograms. The magnetic field variations such as flux, gradient, and sunspot\nrotation revealed that free energy was slowly being stored in the corona. The\nslow low-layer magnetic reconnection may be responsible for this storage and\nthe formation of a sigmoidal core field or a flux rope leading to the eventual\neruption. The occurrence of EUV brightenings in the sigmoidal core field prior\nto the rise of a flux rope suggests that the eruption was triggered by the\ninner tether-cutting reconnection, but not the external breakout reconnection.\nAn impulsive acceleration revealed from fast separation of the H{\\alpha}\nribbons of the first 150 seconds suggests the CME accelerated in the inner\ncorona, which is consistent with the temporal profile of the reconnection\nelectric field. In conclusion, we propose a qualitative model in view of\nframework of a solar eruption involving, mass ejections, filament eruption,\nCME, and subsequent flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 13:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-15"}

To first order, the beaming and the\nreflection/heating effects modulate the stellar brightness at the orbital\nperiod, with phases separated by a quarter of a period, whereas the ellipsoidal\neffect is modulated with the orbital first harmonic.

Its sensitivity to helium is linear over the entire\nmetallicity range, it is minimally affected by age, uncertainties in the\nphotometric zero-point, reddening or the effects of evolution on the horizontal\nbranch. The two main drawbacks are the need for precise and large photometric\ndata sets, and a strong dependence of the {\\Delta}Y/{\\Delta}{\\xi} slope on\nmetallicity. To test the {\\Delta}{\\xi} parameter we selected 22 Galactic\nGlobular Clusters (GGCs) with low foreground reddening, a broad range of iron\nabundance and precise, relatively deep, and homogeneous multi-band (B,V,I)\nphotometry.
