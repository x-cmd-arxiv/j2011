The outbursts are accompanied by\nstrong outflows, with the inferred mass outflow rates reaching ~10% of the mass\ninflow rates. Shu et al. proposed that the outflows represent accreted disc\nmaterial that is driven centrifugally from the spun-up surface layers of the\nprotostar by the stellar magnetic field. This model was critiqued by Calvet et\nal., who argued that it cannot reproduce the photospheric absorption-line\nshifts observed in the prototype object FU Ori. Calvet et al. proposed that the\nwind is launched, instead, from the surface of the disc on scales of a few\nstellar radii by a non-stellar magnetic field. In this paper we present results\nfrom numerical simulations of disc accretion on to a slowly rotating star with\nan aligned magnetic dipole moment that gives rise to a kilogauss-strength\nsurface field. We demonstrate that, for parameters appropriate to FU Ori, such\na system can develop a strong, collimated disc outflow of the type previously\nidentified by Romanova et al. in simulations of protostars with low and\nmoderate accretion rates. At the high accretion rate that characterizes FUOR\noutbursts, the radius at which the disc is truncated by the stellar magnetic\nfield moves much closer to the stellar surface, but the basic properties of the\noutflow, which is launched from the vicinity of the truncation radius along\nopened-up stellar magnetic field lines, remain the same, and are distinct from\nthose of the mechanism proposed by Shu et al. We show that the simulated\noutflow can in principle account for the main observed characteristics of FUOR\nwinds, including the photospheric line shifts measured in FU Ori.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2011 23:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

If the epoch of the first LMC accretion onto the\nGalaxy from outside its viriral radius is more than ~4 Gyr ago (i.e., at least\ntwo pericenter passages), the stars stripped from the stellar halo of the LMC\ncan form an irregular polar ring or a thick disk with a size of ~100 kpc and\nrotational kinematics. On the other hand, if the LMC was first accreted onto\nthe Galaxy quite recently (~ 2 Gyr ago), the stripped stars form shorter\nleading and trailing stellar stream at R=50-120 kpc. Also distributions of the\nstripped stars in phase space between the two cases can be significantly\ndifferent.

It therefore presents a unique\nopportunity to determine independently the physical properties of the three\ncomponents of the system, as well as its distance. We aim at determining the\nfundamental parameters (masses, radii, luminosities, rotational velocities) of\nthe three components of delta Vel, as well as the parallax of the system,\nindependently from the existing Hipparcos} measurement. We determined dynamical\nmasses from high-precision astrometry of the orbits of Aab-B and Aa-Ab using\nadaptive optics (VLT/NACO) and optical interferometry (VLTI/AMBER). The main\ncomponent is an eclipsing binary composed of two early A-type stars in rapid\nrotation. We modeled the photometric and radial velocity measurements of the\neclipsing pair Aa-Ab using a self consistent method based on physical\nparameters (mass, radius, luminosity, rotational velocity). From our\nself-consistent modeling of the primary and secondary components of the delta\nVel A eclipsing pair, we derive their fundamental parameters with a typical\naccuracy of 1%. We find that they have similar masses, respectively\n2.43+/-0.02Msol and 2.27+/-0.02Msol. The physical parameters of the tertiary\ncomponent (delta Vel B) are also estimated, although to a lower accuracy. We\nobtain a parallax of 39.8+/-0.4mas for the system, in satisfactory agreement\n(-1.2 sigma) with the Hipparcos value (40.5+/-0.4mas). The physical parameters\nwe derive represent a consistent set of constraints for the evolutionary\nmodeling of this system. The agreement of the parallax we measure with the\nHipparcos value to a 1% accuracy is also an interesting confirmation of the\ntrue accuracy of these two independent measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 05:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Photometric data in the X-rays,\nultraviolet and near-infrared bands have been used to characterize this event.\nThe SN field was imaged with the ROTSE-IIIb optical telescope about seven days\nbefore the explosion. This allowed us to constrain the epoch of the shock\nbreakout to JD = 2454825.6. The duration of the plateau phase, as derived from\nthe photometric monitoring, was ~ 98 days. The spectra of SN 2008in show a\nstriking resemblance to those of the archetypal low-luminosity IIP SNe 1997D\nand 1999br. A comparison of ejecta kinematics of SN 2008in with the\nhydrodynamical simulations of Type IIP SNe by Dessart et al. (2010) indicates\nthat it is a less energetic event (~ 5$\\times10^{50}$ erg). However, the light\ncurve indicates that the production of radioactive $^{56}$Ni is significantly\nhigher than that in the low-luminosity SNe. Adopting an interstellar absorption\nalong the SN direction of $A_V$ ~ 0.3 mag and a distance of 13.2 Mpc, we\nestimated a synthesized Ni mass of ~ 0.015 $M_{\\odot}$. Employing\nsemi-analytical formulae (Litvinova & Nadezhin 1985), we derived a pre-SN\nradius of ~ 126$R_{\\odot}$, an explosion energy of ~ 5.4$\\times10^{50}$ erg and\na total ejected mass of ~ 16.7$M_{\\odot}$. The latter indicates that the zero\nage main-sequence mass of the progenitor did not exceed 20$M_{\\odot}$.\nConsidering the above properties of SN 2008in, and its occurrence in a region\nof sub-solar metallicity ([O/H] ~ 8.44 dex), it is unlikely that fall-back of\nthe ejecta onto a newly formed black hole occurred in SN 2008in.

In\nessence, energy loss models are effectively only probed in the vicinity of zero\nenergy loss and, as a result, at RHIC energies only the pathlength dependence\nof energy loss offers some discriminating power.

Large values of eccentricity and inclination can be excited and\nstrong correlations settle in among the orbital angles. This dynamical\nbehaviour, in particular for bound dust grains, can potentially cause\nsignificant asymmetries in dusty disks around solar type stars which might be\ndetected by observations. However, the amount of orbital changes due to this\nnon--gravitational perturbation is strongly limited by the collisional lifetime\nof dust particles. We show that for large values of the disk's optical depth\nthe influence of ISM flow on the disk shape is almost negligible because the\ngrains are collisionally destroyed before they can accumulate enough orbital\nchanges due to the ISM perturbations. On the other hand, for values smaller\nthan $10^{-3}$, peculiar asymmetric patterns appear in the density profile of\nthe disk when we consider 1-10 mum grains, just above the blow-out threshold.\nThe extent and relevance of these asymmetries grow for lower values of the\noptical depth. An additional sink mechanism, which may prevent the formation of\nlarge clumps and warping in the disks is related to the fast inward migration\ndue to the drag component of the forces. When a significant eccentricity is\npumped up by the ISM perturbations, the drag forces (Poynting-Robertson and in\nparticular ISM drag) drive the disk particles on fast migrating tracks leading\nthem into the star on a short timescale. It is then expected that disks with\nsmall optical depth expand inside the parent body ring all the way towards the\nstar while disks with large optical depth would not significantly extend\ninside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 11:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

From the fractal geometry point of view, the theory of local\nfractional integrals and derivatives has been dealt with fractal and\ncontinuously non-differentiable functions, and has been successfully applied in\nengineering problems. It points out the proof of the generalized local\nfractional Taylor formula, and is devoted to the applications of the\ngeneralized local fractional Taylor formula to the generalized local fractional\nseries and the approximation of functions. Finally, it is shown that local\nfractional Taylor series of the Mittag-Leffler type function is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 14:58:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2011 07:40:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 20:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-02"}
