Here we corroborate their main conclusion\nbut go on to examine, in some detail, a specific solution that asymptotes to\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We show that part of the boundary of the solution\ncontains the inner bifurcation two - sphere of the Schwarzschild - de Sitter\nspacetime and so both the black and white hole horizons together form a partial\nboundary of this McVittie solution. We go on to show that the null and weak\nenergy conditions are satisfied and that the dominant energy condition is\nsatisfied almost everywhere in the solution. The solution is understood here by\nway of a systematic construction of a conformal diagram based on detailed\nnumerical integrations of the null geodesic equations. We find that the\nMcVittie solution admits a degenerate limit in which the bifurcation two -\nsphere disappears. For solutions with zero cosmological constant, we find no\nevidence for the development of a weak null singularity. Rather, we find that\nin this case there is either a black hole to the future of an initial\nsingularity or a white hole to its past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 16:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 18:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}

In this context, wave\npacket initial conditions with a single carrier frequency excite infinitely\nmany resonances. On large but finite time-scales, the coupled evolution of\nbackward and forward waves is governed by nonlocal equations of resonant\nnonlinear geometrical optics. For the special class of solutions which are\nperiodic in the fast phase, these equations are equivalent to an infinite\nsystem of nonlinear coupled mode equations, the so called it extended nonlinear\ncoupled mode equations, xNLCME. Numerical studies support the existence of\nlong-lived spatially localized coherent structures, featuring a slowly varying\nenvelope and a train of carrier shocks.\n  In this paper we explore, by analytical, asymptotic and numerical methods,\nthe existence and properties of spatially localized structures of the xNLCME\nsystem, which arises for a refractive index profile consisting of periodic\narray of Dirac delta functions.\n  We consider the limit of small amplitude solutions with frequencies near a\nband-edge. In this case, stationary xNLCME is well-approximated by an infinite\nsystem of coupled, stationary, nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations, the extended\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger system, xNLS.

Using\nbifurcation methods we show existence of solutions for a range of\n$\\epsilon\\in(-\\epsilon_0,\\epsilon_0)$ and, by a numerical continuation method,\nestablish the continuation of certain branches all the way to $\\epsilon=1$.\nFinally, we perform time-dependent simulations of truncated xNLCME and find the\nsmall-amplitude solitons to be robust to both numerical errors and the NLS\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 17:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

Using numerical\nsimulations, we compute the radial distribution function (RDF), which measures\nthe probability of finding particle pairs at given distances, and the\nprobability density function of the particle concentration. The clustering\nstatistics depend on the Stokes number, $St$, defined as the ratio of the\nparticle friction timescale, $\\tau_{\\rm p} $, to the Kolmogorov timescale in\nthe flow. In the dissipation range, the clustering intensity strongly peaks at\n$St \\simeq 1$, and the RDF for $St \\sim 1$ shows a fast power-law increase\ntoward small scales, suggesting that turbulent clustering may considerably\nenhance the particle collision rate. Clustering at inertial-range scales is of\nparticular interest to the problem of planetesimal formation. At these scales,\nthe strongest clustering is from particles with $\\tau_{\\rm p}$ in the inertial\nrange. Clustering of these particles occurs primarily around a scale where the\neddy turnover time is $\\sim\\tau_{\\rm p}$. Particles of different sizes tend to\ncluster at different locations, leading to flat RDFs between different\nparticles at small scales. In the presence of multiple particle sizes, the\noverall clustering strength decreases as the particle size distribution\nbroadens. We discuss particle clustering in recent models for planetesimal\nformation. We point out that, in the model based on turbulent clustering of\nchondrule-size particles, the probability of finding strong clusters that can\nseed planetesimals may have been significantly overestimated.

High intensity\nturbulence is considered with the r.m.s. velocity 35 times the laminar flame\nspeed, S_L, resulting in the Damkohler number Da = 0.05. Here we show that: (1)\nThe flame brush has a complex internal structure, in which the isosurfaces of\nhigher fuel mass fractions are folded on progressively smaller scales. (2)\nGlobal properties of the turbulent flame are best represented by the structure\nof the region of peak reaction rate, which defines the flame surface. (3) In\nthe thin reaction zone regime, S_T is predominantly determined by the increase\nof the flame surface area, A_T, caused by turbulence. (4) The observed increase\nof S_T relative to S_L exceeds the corresponding increase of A_T relative to\nthe surface area of the planar laminar flame, on average, by ~14%, varying from\nonly a few percent to ~30%. (5) This exaggerated response is the result of\ntight flame packing by turbulence, which causes frequent flame collisions and\nformation of regions of high flame curvature, or \"cusps.\" (6) The local flame\nspeed in the cusps substantially exceeds its laminar value, which results in a\ndisproportionately large contribution of cusps to S_T compared with the flame\nsurface area in them. (7) A criterion is established for transition to the\nregime significantly influenced by cusp formation. In particular, at Karlovitz\nnumbers Ka > 20, flame collisions provide an important mechanism controlling\nS_T, in addition to the increase of A_T by large-scale motions and the\npotential enhancement of diffusive transport by small-scale turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2011 00:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

In particular, no nesting properties of electron and hole -\nlike Fermi surfaces is observed, casting doubts on most popular theoretical\nschemes of Cooper pairing for these systems. The discovery of Fe vacancies\nordering and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at pretty high temperatures (T_N>\n500 K), much exceeding superconducting T_c makes these systems unique\nantiferromagnetic superconductors with highest T_N observed up to now.

We consider the question of what happens when target constraints are\nallowed. Specifically, we consider the question of specifying the composition\nof standard schema mappings (those specified by st-tgds, target egds, and a\nweakly acyclic set of target tgds). We show that SO tgds, even with the\nassistance of arbitrary source constraints and target constraints, cannot\nspecify in general the composition of two standard schema mappings. Therefore,\nwe introduce source-to-target second-order dependencies (st-SO dependencies),\nwhich are similar to SO tgds, but allow equations in the conclusion. We show\nthat st-SO dependencies (along with target egds and target tgds) are sufficient\nto express the composition of every finite sequence of standard schema\nmappings, and further, every st-SO dependency specifies such a composition. In\naddition to this expressive power, we show that st-SO dependencies enjoy other\ndesirable properties. In particular, they have a polynomial-time chase that\ngenerates a universal solution. This universal solution can be used to find the\ncertain answers to unions of conjunctive queries in polynomial time. It is easy\nto show that the composition of an arbitrary number of standard schema mappings\nis equivalent to the composition of only two standard schema mappings. We show\nthat surprisingly, the analogous result holds also for schema mappings\nspecified by just st-tgds (no target constraints).

An analysis of the various decoherence\nsources and disorders shows that our scheme can serve as a guide to coming\nexperiments involving a small number of coupled resonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2011 14:19:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 10:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The mechanism of oxidation is studied by analysing their\ncompositional and morphological evolution over a long span of time (three\nyears) due to exposure to ambient atmosphere. It is concluded that the\nmechanism proceeds in two steps. In the first step, the shell of ZnO forms over\nZn NCs rapidly up to certain limiting thickness: with in few days -- depending\nupon the size -- Zn NCs are converted to Zn-ZnO (core-shell), Zn-void-ZnO, or\nhollow ZnO type NCs. Bigger than ~15 nm become Zn-ZnO (core-shell) type: among\nthem, NCs above ~25 nm could able to retain their initial geometrical shapes\n(namely triangular, hexagonal, rectangular and rhombohedral), but ~25 to 15 nm\nsize NCs become irregular or distorted geometrical shapes. NCs between ~15 to 5\nnm become Zn-void-ZnO type, and smaller than ~5 nm become ZnO hollow sphere\ntype i.e. ZnO hollow NCs. In the second step, all Zn-void-ZnO and Zn-ZnO\n(core-shell) structures are converted to hollow ZnO NCs in a slow and gradual\nprocess, and the mechanism of conversion proceeds through expansion in size by\nincorporating ZnO monomers inside the shell. The observed oxidation behaviour\nof NCs is compared with theory of Cabrera - Mott on low-temperature oxidation\nof metal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2011 15:12:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 06:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-29"}

In this article we develop a method which - under suitable\nassumptions - allows to compute the JSR and the LSR of a finite family of\nmatrices exactly. We remark that so far no algorithm was available in the\nliterature to compute the LSR exactly.\n  The paper presents necessary theoretical results on extremal norms (and on\nextremal antinorms) of linear operators, which constitute the basic tools of\nour procedures, and a detailed description of the corresponding algorithms for\nthe computation of the JSR and LSR (the last one restricted to families sharing\nan invariant cone). The algorithms are easily implemented and their\ndescriptions are short.\n  If the algorithms terminate in finite time, then they construct an extremal\nnorm (in the JSR case) or antinorm (in the LSR case) and find their exact\nvalues; otherwise they provide upper and lower bounds that both converge to the\nexact values. A theoretical criterion for termination in finite time is also\nderived. According to numerical experiments, the algorithm for the JSR finds\nthe exact value for the vast majority of matrix families in dimensions less\nthan 20. For nonnegative matrices it works faster and finds JSR in dimensions\nof order 100 within a few iterations; the same is observed for the algorithm\ncomputing the LSR. To illustrate the efficiency of the new method we are able\nto apply it in order to give answers to several conjectures which have been\nrecently stated in combinatorics, number theory, and the theory of formal\nlanguages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2011 15:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}
