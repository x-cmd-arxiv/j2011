We consider the fluid obeys an ideal\ngas equation of state as a simple model of dark matter with pressure. Assuming\nout of equilibrium initial conditions we search for late-time attractor type of\nsolutions, which we found to show a constant accretion rate for the non-zero\npressure case, that is, the pressure itself suffices to produce stationary\naccretion regimes. We then analyze the resulting density profile of such\nlate-time solutions with the function $A/r^{\\kappa}$. For different values of\nthe adiabatic index we find different slopes of the density profile, and we\nstudy such profile in two regions: a region one near the black hole, located\nfrom the horizon up to 50$M$ and a region two from $\\sim 800M$ up to $\\sim\n1500M$, which for a black hole of $10^{9}M_{\\odot}$ corresponds to $\\sim\n0.1$pc. The profile depends on the adiabatic index or equivalently on the\npressure of the fluid and our findings are as follows: in the near region the\ndensity profile shows values of $\\kappa <1.5$ and in the limit of the\npressure-less case $\\kappa \\rightarrow 1.5$; on the other hand, in region two,\nthe value of $\\kappa<0.3$ in all the cases we studied. If these results are to\nbe applied to the dark matter problem, the conclusion is that, in the limit of\npressure-less gas the density profile is cuspy only near the black hole and\napproaches a non-cuspy profile at bigger scales within 1pc. These results show\non the one hand that pressure suffices to provide flat density profiles of dark\nmatter and on the other hand show that the presence of a central black hole\ndoes not distort the density profile of dark matter at scales of 0.1pc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 16:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

However, deployment is impeded by their relatively low power\nconversion efficiencies. The last decade has seen significant progress in\nenhancing the power conversion of these devices through various strategies. One\nsuch approach is based on morphology control. This is because morphology\naffects all phenomena involved in solar conversion: light absorption and\nelectron-hole pair (exciton) generation; exciton diffusion and dissociation\ninto free charges; and transport of charges to the electrodes. Progress in\nexperimental characterization and computational modeling now allow\nreconstruction and imaging of the thin film morphology. This opens up the\npossibility of rationally linking fabrication with morphology, as well as\nmorphology with performance. In this context, a comprehensive set of\ncomputational tools to rapidly quantify and classify the heterogeneous internal\nstructure of thin films will be invaluable in linking process, structure and\nproperty.

We apply different decomposition methods for the 1D luminosity\nprofiles and 2D images. These include non-linear least-squares and Bayesian\nMonte-Carlo Markov-chain analyses. The basic photometric model for M31 has a\nSersic bulge with shape index n = 2.2 +/- 0.3 and effective radius R_e = 1.0\n+/- 0.2 kpc, a dust-free exponential disk of scale length R_d = 5.3 +/- 0.5\nkpc; the parameter errors reflect the range between various decomposition\nmethods. The bulge parameter, n, is rather insensitive to bandpass effects and\nits value suggests a first rapid formation via mergers followed by secular\ngrowth from the disk. The M31 halo has a 2D power-law index ~ -2.5 +/- 0.2. We\nfind that the M31 bulge light is mostly dominant over the range R_minor < 1.2\nkpc. The disk takes over in the range 1.2 kpc < R_minor < 9 kpc, whereas the\nhalo dominates at R_minor > 9 kpc. The stellar nucleus, bulge, disk, and halo\ncomponents each contribute roughly 0.05%, 23%, 73% and 4% of the total light of\nM31 out to 200 kpc along the minor axis. Nominal errors for the structural\nparameters of the M31 bulge, disk and halo amount to 20%. If M31 and the Milky\nWay are at all typical, faint stellar halos should be routinely detected in\ngalaxy surveys reaching below mu_i ~ 27 mag/arcsec^2. We stress that our\nresults rely on this photometric analysis alone.

On 2011 March 25, the Swift {\\gamma}-ray satellite\ndiscovered an unusual transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) potentially\nrepresenting such an event.

Taking advantage of the wide field of view available using the PTF\ncamera at the Palomar 48\" telescope, 40 nights were dedicated in December\n2009-January 2010 to perform continuous high-cadence differential photometry on\na single field containing the young (7-10Myr) 25 Ori association. The primary\nmotivation for the project is to search for planets around young stars in this\nregion. The unique data set also provides for much ancillary science. In this\nfirst paper we describe the survey and data reduction pipeline, and present\ninitial results from an inspection of the most clearly varying stars relating\nto two of the ancillary science objectives: detection of eclipsing binaries and\nyoung stellar objects. We find 82 new eclipsing binary systems, 9 of which we\nare candidate 25 Ori- or Orion OB1a-association members. Of these, 2 are\npotential young W UMa type systems.

One of\nthe candidate young systems presents an unusual light curve, perhaps\nrepresenting a semi-detached binary system with an inflated low-mass primary or\na star with a warped disk, and may represent an additional young Orion member.\nFinally, we identify 14 probable new classical T-Tauri stars in our data, along\nwith one previously known (CVSO 35) and one previously reported as a candidate\nweak-line T-Tauri star (SDSS J052700.12+010136.8).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 20:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 02:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-12"}

Throughout the main period of energy release there is\na super-hot (T>30 MK) plasma emitting thermal bremsstrahlung atop the flare\nloops. Our model describes the heating and compression of such a source by\nlocalized, transient magnetic reconnection. It is a three-dimensional\ngeneralization of the Petschek model whereby Alfven-speed retraction following\nreconnection drives supersonic inflows parallel to the field lines, which form\nshocks heating, compressing, and confining a loop-top plasma plug. The\nconfining inflows provide longer life than a freely-expanding or\nconductively-cooling plasma of similar size and temperature. Superposition of\nsuccessive transient episodes of localized reconnection across a current sheet\nproduces an apparently persistent, localized source of high-temperature\nemission. The temperature of the source decreases smoothly on a time scale\nconsistent with observations, far longer than the cooling time of a single\nplug. Built from a disordered collection of small plugs, the source need not\nhave the coherent jet-like structure predicted by steady-state reconnection\nmodels. This new model predicts temperatures and emission measure consistent\nwith the observations of 26 Feb 2004. Furthermore, the total energy released by\nthe flare is found to be roughly consistent with that predicted by the model.\nOnly a small fraction of the energy released appears in the super-hot source at\nany one time, but roughly a quarter of the flare energy is thermalized by the\nreconnection shocks over the course of the flare.

Our work implies that a\nstrong direct sum theorem for communication complexity holds if and only if\nefficient compression of communication protocols is possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 23:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

Creativity presents a formidable\nchallenge for neuroscience. Neuroscience generally involves studying what\nhappens in the brain when someone engages in a task that involves responding to\na stimulus, or retrieving information from memory and using it the right way,\nor at the right time. If the relevant information is not already encoded in\nmemory, the task generally requires that the individual make systematic use of\ninformation that is encoded in memory. But creativity is different. It\nparadoxically involves studying how someone pulls out of their brain something\nthat was never put into it! Moreover, it must be something both new and useful,\nor appropriate to the task at hand. The ability to pull out of memory something\nnew and appropriate that was never stored there in the first place is what we\nrefer to as the magic of creativity. Even if we are so fortunate as to\ndetermine which areas of the brain are active and how these areas interact\nduring creative thought, we will not have an answer to the question of how the\nbrain comes up with solutions and artworks that are new and appropriate. On the\nother hand, since the representational capacity of neurons emerges at a level\nthat is higher than that of the individual neurons themselves, the inner\nworkings of neurons is too low a level to explain the magic of creativity. Thus\nwe look to a level that is midway between gross brain regions and neurons.\nSince creativity generally involves combining concepts from different domains,\nor seeing old ideas from new perspectives, we focus our efforts on the neural\nmechanisms underlying the representation of concepts and ideas. Thus we ask\nquestions about the brain at the level that accounts for its representational\ncapacity, i.e. at the level of distributed aggregates of neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 00:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 01:41:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 22:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

The\nequilibrium states of the stationary, axisymmetric magnetic fields in the\nmagnetar magnetosphere are obtained as solutions of the Grad-Shafranov equation\nin a Schwarzschild spacetime. To understand the magnetic energy buildup in the\nmagnetar magnetosphere, a generalized magnetic virial theorem in the\nSchwarzschild metric is newly derived. We carefully address the question\nwhether the magnetar magnetospheric magnetic field can build up sufficient\nmagnetic energy to account for the work required to open up the magnetic field\nduring magnetar giant flares. We point out the importance of the Aly-Sturrock\nconstraint, which has been widely studied in solar corona mass ejections, as a\nreference state in understanding magnetar energy storage processes. We examine\nhow the magnetic field can possess enough energy to overcome the Aly-Sturrock\nenergy constraint and open up. In particular, general relativistic (GR) effects\non the Aly-Sturrock energy constraint in the Schwarzschild spacetime are\ncarefully investigated. It is found that, for magnetar outbursts, the\nAly-Sturrock constraint is more stringent, i.e., the Aly-Sturrock energy\nthreshold is enhanced due to the GR effects. In addition, neutron stars with\ngreater mass have a higher Aly-Sturrock energy threshold and are more difficult\nto erupt. This indicates that magnetars are probably not neutron stars with\nextreme mass. For a typical neutron star with mass of $1-2 M_{\\odot}$, we\nfurther explore the effects of cross-field current effects, caused by the mass\nloading, on the possibility of stored magnetic field energy exceeding the\nAly-Sturrock threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 07:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We focus on the retapping\ncurrent in a down-sweep of the current, at which a nanowire re-enters the\nsuperconducting state from a normal state. The retrapping current is found to\nbe significantly smaller than the switching current at which the nanowire\nswitches into the normal state from a superconducting state during a current\nup-sweep. For wires of different lengths, we analyze the heat removal due to\nvarious processes, including electronic and phonon processes. For a short wires\n1.5 um in length, electronic thermal conduction is effective; for longer wires\n10um in length, phonon conduction becomes important. We demonstrate that the\nmeasured retrapping current as a function of temperature can be quantitatively\naccounted for by the selfheating occurring in the normal portions of the\nnanowires to better than 20 % accuracy. For the phonon processes, the extracted\nthermal conduction parameters support the notion of a reduced phase-space below\n3-dimensions, consistent with the phonon thermal wavelength having exceeded the\nlateral dimensions at temperatures below ~ 1.3K. Nevertheless, surprisingly the\nbest fit was achieved with a functional form corresponding to 3-dimensional\nphonons, albeit requiring parameters far exceeding known values in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 10:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We\nthen show how these can be applied to obtain robust exploration policies in a\nBayesian reinforcement learning setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 14:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 14:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-14"}
