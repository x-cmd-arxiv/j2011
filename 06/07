It can be argued that muscular function, limb movements, and touch\nperception serve supervisory functions for movement control in motion and\ntouch-based (e.g. manipulable) devices/interfaces and human-machine interfaces\nin general. To get at this hypothesis requires the use of novel techniques and\nanalyses which demonstrate the multifaceted and regulatory role of adaptive\nphysiological processes in these interactions. Neuromechanics is an approach\nthat unifies the role of physiological function, motor performance, and\nenvironmental effects in determining human performance. A neuromechanical\nperspective will be used to explain the effect of environmental fluctuations on\nsupervisory mechanisms, which leads to adaptive physiological responses. Three\nexperiments are presented using two different types of virtual environment that\nallowed for selective switching between two sets of environmental forces. This\nswitching was done in various ways to maximize the variety of results.\nElectromyography (EMG) and kinematic information contributed to the development\nof human performance-related measures. Both descriptive and specialized\nanalyses were conducted: peak amplitude analysis, loop trace analysis, and the\nanalysis of unmatched muscle power. Results presented here provide a window\ninto performance under a range of conditions. These analyses also demonstrated\nmyriad consequences for force-related fluctuations on dynamic physiological\nregulation. The findings presented here could be applied to the dynamic control\nof touch-based and movement-sensitive human-machine systems. In particular, the\ndesign of systems such as human-robotic systems, touch screen devices, and\nrehabilitative technologies could benefit from this research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 16:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 13:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-15"}

Therefore characteristics of dynamics near this state (such as its\nstability properties/Lyapunov exponents or distributions of the durations of\nsynchronized episodes) do not describe system's dynamics for most of the time.\nWe consider an approach to characterize the system dynamics in this case, by\nexploring the relationship between the phases on each cycle of oscillations.

These asymmetries are most prominent in loop footpoint\nregions, where a clear correlation of the asymmetry with the Doppler shift and\nline width determined from the single Gaussian fit is found. Such asymmetries\nsuggest at least two emission components: a primary component accounting for\nthe background emission and a secondary component associated with high-speed\nupflows. The latter has been proposed to play a vital role in the coronal\nheating process and there is no agreement on its properties. Here we slightly\nmodify the initially developed technique of Red-Blue (RB) asymmetry analysis\nand apply it to both artificial spectra and spectra observed by the EUV Imaging\nSpectrometer onboard Hinode, and demonstrate that the secondary component\nusually contributes a few percent of the total emission, has a velocity ranging\nfrom 50 to 150 km s-1 and a Gaussian width comparable to that of the primary\none in loop footpoint regions.

It is shown by analysis of\nthe plane-wave solution that, (1) there may be a pseudo-power flow when a\nmedium moves, and the Poynting vector does not necessarily denote the direction\nof real power flowing, (2) Minkowski's light momentum and energy constitute a\nLorentz four-vector in a form of single photon or single EM-field cell, and\nPlanck constant is a Lorentz invariant, (3) there is no momentum transfer\ntaking place between the plane wave and the uniform medium, and the EM momentum\nconservation equation cannot be uniquely determined without resort to the\nprinciple of relativity, and (4) the moving medium behaves as a so-called\n\"negative index medium\" when it moves opposite to the wave vector at a\nfaster-than-dielectric light speed. It is also shown by analysis of EM-field\nLorentz transformations that, when a static electric (magnetic) field moves in\nfree space, neither Abraham's nor Minkowski's formulation can correctly\ndescribe a real electromagnetic momentum; as an application of this principle,\nthe classical electron mass-energy paradox is analyzed and resolved. Finally, a\ngeneral EM momentum definition is proposed, and according to this new\ndefinition, the traditional \"Abraham-type\" and \"Minkowski-type\" momentums in\nthe dispersion wave-guiding systems, such as regular dielectric-filled metallic\nwaveguides, are found to be included in the same momentum formulation, but they\nappear at different frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 19:47:45 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 10:30:36 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 10:39:32 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 18:05:28 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 19:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 19:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2011 08:02:56 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2011 22:19:29 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2011 02:03:10 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 08:53:04 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 10:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 19:44:19 GMT"},{"version":"v20","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2011 10:47:17 GMT"},{"version":"v21","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 08:40:15 GMT"},{"version":"v22","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2011 16:47:16 GMT"},{"version":"v23","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 09:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v24","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 17:26:13 GMT"},{"version":"v25","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 05:55:29 GMT"},{"version":"v26","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 21:13:52 GMT"},{"version":"v27","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 03:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v28","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 19:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v29","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 11:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 19:07:35 GMT"},{"version":"v30","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 11:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v31","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 02:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v32","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 06:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v33","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 08:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v34","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 09:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v35","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 08:28:11 GMT"},{"version":"v36","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 17:31:47 GMT"},{"version":"v37","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2012 14:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v38","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 02:43:42 GMT"},{"version":"v39","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 19:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 10:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v40","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 05:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v41","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 19:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v42","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 03:27:39 GMT"},{"version":"v43","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 08:44:32 GMT"},{"version":"v44","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 19:16:46 GMT"},{"version":"v45","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2012 03:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v46","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 07:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v47","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 17:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v48","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 16:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v49","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 05:56:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 21:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v50","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 00:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v51","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 10:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v52","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 19:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v53","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 01:50:57 GMT"},{"version":"v54","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 20:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v55","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 22:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v56","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 15:58:00 GMT"},{"version":"v57","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2012 21:22:00 GMT"},{"version":"v58","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 07:03:17 GMT"},{"version":"v59","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 07:18:55 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2011 09:33:50 GMT"},{"version":"v60","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2012 15:27:03 GMT"},{"version":"v61","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 14:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v62","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 02:48:40 GMT"},{"version":"v63","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 17:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v64","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 17:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v65","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 19:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v66","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 03:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v67","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 18:10:10 GMT"},{"version":"v68","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 18:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v69","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 19:16:37 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 13:16:18 GMT"},{"version":"v70","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 20:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v71","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 19:00:34 GMT"},{"version":"v72","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 16:55:04 GMT"},{"version":"v73","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 17:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v74","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 15:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v75","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 09:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v76","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 21:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v77","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 21:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 09:35:24 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2011 07:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

As a first step, we build on\nthe hypothesis of a volume density threshold for overall star formation and the\nmodel of Parmentier (2011) to establish the mass-radius relations of molecular\nclumps containing given masses of star-forming gas. Specifically, we relate the\nmass $m_{clump}$, radius $r_{clump}$ and density profile slope $-p$ of\nmolecular clumps which contain a mass $m_{th}$ of gas denser than a volume\ndensity threshold $\\rho_{th}$. In a second step, we use the relation between\nthe mass of embedded-clusters and the mass of their most-massive star to\nestimate the minimum mass of star-forming gas needed to form a $10\\,M_{\\odot}$\nstar. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $SFE \\simeq 0.30$, this gives\n$m_{th,crit} \\simeq 150 M_{\\odot}$. In a third step, we demonstrate that, for\nsensible choices of the clump density index ($p \\simeq 1.7$) and of the cluster\nformation density threshold ($n_{th} \\simeq 10^4\\,cm^{-3}$), the line of\nconstant $m_{th,crit} \\simeq 150 M_{\\odot}$ in the mass-radius space of\nmolecular structures equates with the MSF limit for spatial scales larger than\n0.3\\,pc.

For radii smaller than 0.3\\,pc, the MSF limit is shown to be consistent\nwith the formation of a $10\\,M_{\\odot}$ star out of its individual pre-stellar\ncore of density threshold $n_{th} \\simeq 10^5\\,cm^{-3}$.

Little is known\nhowever, when it comes to escape fractions and the mechanisms behind the\nleakage. To learn more one may look at local objects, but so far only one low-z\ngalaxy has shown any sign of emitting LyC radiation. With data from the Far\nUltraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), Bergvall et al. (2006) found an\nabsolute escape fraction of ionizing photons (f_esc) of 4-10% for the blue\ncompact galaxy Haro 11. However, using a newer version of the reduction\npipeline on the same data set, Grimes et al. (2007) could not confirm this and\nderived an upper limit of f_esc \\leq 2%. Here, using the last version of the\npipeline CalFUSE v3.2, we aim at settling the question if Haro 11 is emitting\nionizing radiation to a significant level or not. We also investigate the\nperformance of the reduction pipeline for faint targets such as Haro 11. At\nthese faint flux levels both FUSE and CalFUSE are pushed to their limits, and a\ndetailed analysis was undertaken. We show that non-simultaneous background\nestimates are insuffient when working with low signal-to-noise data, and a new\nbackground model was developed based on a direct fit to the detector response.\nApplying the new background fit, a significant signal in the LyC emerged in\nboth detector segments covering these wavelengths. Thus, the leakage is\nconfirmed with a flux density of f_900=4.0 *10^{-15} erg/s/cm^2/{\\AA}\n(S/N=4.6), measured on the airglow free regions in the LyC for the night only\ndata. This corresponds to an absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons for\nHaro 11 of f_esc=3.3 \\pm 0.7%.

Galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nuLnu(8) to 8-1000\num infrared luminosity (LIR) tend to lie along lines of constant offset from\nthe main sequence. We explore the relation between SED shape and offset in\nspecific star formation rate (SSFR) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.\nMain sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nuLnu(8)/LIR regardless of LIR\nand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nuLnu(8)/LIR decreases with increasing offset\nabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. We\nprovide a redshift-independent calibration of SED templates in the range of\n8--60 um as a function of log(SSFR) offset from the main sequence. Redshift\ndependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.\nUltra deep IRS spectra match these SED trends well and verify that they are\nmostly due to a change in ratio of PAH to LIR rather than continua of hidden\nAGN. Alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nuLnu(8)/LIR on LIR. Same\nnuLnu(8)/LIR is reached at increasingly higher LIR at higher redshift, with\nshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(LIR) at redshifts z~1 and\nz~2. Corresponding SED template calibrations are provided for use if no stellar\nmasses are in hand. For most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also host\nan AGN, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2011 20:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 12:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 18:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The gas is\nidentified thanks to the ultra-strong Mg II absorption features it imprints in\nthe rest-frame UV spectra of galaxies in the background of the overdensity.\nThere is no evidence that the optically-thick gas is part of any massive galaxy\n(i.e. M_star > 4x10^9 M_sun), but rather is associated with the overdensity;\nless massive and fainter galaxies (25.5 < z_850 < 27.5 mag) have too large an\nimpact parameter to be causing ultra-strong absorption systems, based on our\nknowledge of such systems. The lack of corresponding Fe II absorption features,\nnot detected even in co-added spectra, suggests that the gas is chemically more\npristine than the ISM and outflows of star-forming galaxies at similar\nredshift, including those in the overdensity itself, and comparable to the most\nmetal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo. A crude estimate of the projected\ncovering factor of the high-column density gas (N_H >~ 10^20 cm-2) based on the\nobserved fraction of galaxies with ultra-strong absorbers is C_F ~ 0.04. A\nbroad, continuum absorption profile extending to the red of the interstellar Mg\nII absorption line by <~ 2000 km/s is possibly detected in two independent\nco-added spectra of galaxies of the overdensity, consistent with a large-scale\ninfall motion of the gas onto the overdensity and its galaxies.

The stellar and planetary masses and radii depend on the\neccentricity of the system, which is poorly constrained due to the high\nvelocity jitter (~80m/s).

The shape effect makes a main contribution to determine the\nsize of the polarizability.

This signal\n(amplitude and width) may be used to analyze the relative area fraction of\noriented plates in the cloud top layer and their characteristic tilt angle to\nthe horizontal. We make use of spaceborne measurements from the POLDER\ninstrument to provide a statistical analysis of these parameters. More than\nhalf of the clouds show a detectable maximum reflectance in the glint\ndirection, although this maximum may be rather faint. The typical effective\nfraction (area weighted) of oriented plates in clouds lies between 10-3 and\n10-2. For those oriented plates, the characteristic tilt angle is less than 1\ndegree in most cases. These low fractions imply that the impact of oriented\nplates on the cloud albedo is insignificant. The largest proportion of clouds\nwith horizontally oriented plates is found in the range 500-700 hPa, in\nagreement with typical in situ observation of plates in clouds. We propose a\nsimple aerodynamic model that accounts for the orienting torque of the flow as\nthe plate falls under its own gravity and the disorienting effects of Brownian\nmotion and atmospheric turbulence. The model indicates that the horizontal\nplate diameters are in the range 0.1 to a few millimeters. For such sizes,\nBrownian forces have a negligible impact on the plate orientation. On the other\nhand, typical levels of atmospheric turbulence lead to tilt angles that are\nsimilar to those estimated from the glint observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 01:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A hybrid system is a\nsystem mixing continuous and discrete behaviours that cannot be faithfully\nmodeled neither by using a formalism with continuous dynamics only nor by a\nformalism including only discrete dynamics. We use the well known framework of\nhybrid automata for modeling hybrid systems, and we define a Fault Diagnosis\nGame on them, using two players: the environment and the diagnoser. The\nenvironment controls the evolution of the system and chooses whether and when a\nfault occurs. The diagnoser observes the external behaviour of the system and\nannounces whether a fault has occurred or not.

The focus of this paper is the design of a systematic\nMDS code with the additional property that a single disk failure can be\nrepaired with minimum repair bandwidth, i.e., with the minimum possible amount\nof data to be downloaded for recovery of the failed disk. Previously, a lower\nbound of (n-1)/(n-k) units has been established by Dimakis et. al, on the\nrepair bandwidth for a single disk failure in an (n,k) MDS code . Recently, the\nexistence of asymptotic codes achieving this lower bound for arbitrary (n,k)\nhas been established by drawing connections to interference alignment. While\nthe existence of asymptotic constructions achieving this lower bound have been\nshown, finite code constructions achieving this lower bound existed in previous\nliterature only for the special (high-redundancy) scenario where $k \\leq\n\\max(n/2,3)$. The question of existence of finite codes for arbitrary values of\n(n,k) achieving the lower bound on the repair bandwidth remained open.

Finding an answer to this difficult question is of\nimportance to model time-series showing trend-like behavior, such as river\nrun-off in hydrology, historical temperatures in the study of climates changes,\nor packet counts in network traffic engineering. The main goal of this paper is\nto develop a test procedure to detect the presence of non-stationarity for a\nclass of processes whose $K$-th order difference is stationary. Contrary to\nmost of the proposed methods, the test procedure has the same distribution for\nshort-range and long-range dependence covariance stationary processes, which\nmeans that this test is able to detect the presence of non-stationarity for\nprocesses showing long-range dependence or which are unit root. The proposed\ntest is formulated in the wavelet domain, where a change in the generalized\nspectral density results in a change in the variance of wavelet coefficients at\none or several scales. Such tests have been already proposed in\n\\cite{whitcher:2001}, but these authors do not have taken into account the\ndependence of the wavelet coefficients within scales and between scales.\nTherefore, the asymptotic distribution of the test they have proposed was\nerroneous; as a consequence, the level of the test under the null hypothesis of\nstationarity was wrong. In this contribution, we introduce two test procedures,\nboth using an estimator of the variance of the scalogram at one or several\nscales. The asymptotic distribution of the test under the null is rigorously\njustified. The pointwise consistency of the test in the presence of a single\njump in the general spectral density is also be presented. A limited\nMonte-Carlo experiment is performed to illustrate our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 07:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-08"}

We take\nthis protein diversity into account by modulating protein-protein interaction\npotentials both at short and longer range. We confirm theoretical predictions\nin terms of biological cluster specialization by deciphering how clusters\nrecruit only a few protein species. In this respect, we highlight that cluster\nphases can turn out to be an advantage at the biological level, for example by\nenhancing the cell response to external stimuli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 08:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-08"}

A new\ndamping mechanism inspired by the architecture of trees is here identified and\ncharacterized in the simplest tree-like structure, a Y-shape branched\nstructure. Through analytical and numerical analyses of a simple\ntwo-degree-of-freedom model, branching is shown to be the key ingredient in\nthis protective mechanism that we call damping-by-branching. It originates in\nthe geometrical nonlinearities so that it is specifically efficient to damp out\nlarge amplitudes of motion. A more realistic model, using flexible beam\napproximation, shows that the mechanism is robust. Finally, two bioinspired\narchitectures are analyzed, showing significant levels of damping achieved via\nbranching with typically 30% of the energy being dissipated in one oscillation.\nThis concept of damping-by-branching is of simple practical use in the design\nof slender flexible structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 08:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A more complete understanding\nof the behaviour of RE J1034+396 can therefore lead to a unification of the\naccretion physics between such extreme AGN and super-Eddington BHBs.

Instead the periodically changing\nabsorption may be produced by the QPO causing a change in ionization state. We\nextend our analysis by including the covariance spectra which give much better\nsignal to noise than an rms spectrum. These reveal a new aspect of the QPO,\nwhich is that there is also a small contribution from a soft component which is\nhotter than the soft excess seen in the mean spectrum.

Limiting the confusion from Galactic and Extragalactic foregrounds is\ncritical to the success of these telescopes. Instrumental response or the Point\nSpread Function (PSF) of such telescopes is inherently 3 dimensional with\nfrequency mapping to the Line of Sight (LOS) distance. EoR signals will\nnecessarily have to be detected in data where continuum confusion persists;\ntherefore, it is important that the PSF has acceptable frequency structure so\nthat the residual foreground does not confuse the EoR signature. This paper\naims to understand the 3 dimensional PSF and foreground contamination in the\nsame framework. We develop a formalism to estimate the foreground contamination\nalong frequency, or equivalently LOS dimension, and establish a relationship\nbetween foreground contamination in the image plane and visibility weights on\nthe Fourier plane. We identify two dominant sources of LOS foreground\ncontamination-'PSF contamination' and 'gridding contamination'. We show that\n'PSF contamination' is localized in LOS wavenumber space, beyond which there\npotentially exists an 'EoR window' with negligible foreground contamination\nwhere we may focus our efforts to detect EoR. 'PSF contamination' in this\nwindow may be substantially reduced by judicious choice of a frequency window\nfunction. Gridding and imaging algorithms create additional 'gridding\ncontamination' and we propose a new imaging algorithm using the Chirp Z\nTransform (CZT) that significantly reduces this contamination.

Here,\nunlike in the case of crystals where structures can be solved by model building\nand phase refinement, the phase distribution of the wave scattered by an\nindividual molecule must directly be recovered. There are two well-known\nsolutions to the phase problem: holography and coherent diffraction imaging\n(CDI). Both techniques have their pros and cons. In holography, the\nreconstruction of the scattered complex-valued object wave is directly provided\nby a well-defined reference wave that must cover the entire detector area which\noften is an experimental challenge. CDI provides the highest possible, only\nwavelength limited, resolution, but the phase recovery is an iterative process\nwhich requires some pre-defined information about the object and whose outcome\nis not always uniquely-defined. Moreover, the diffraction patterns must be\nrecorded under oversampling conditions, a pre-requisite to be able to solve the\nphase problem. Here, we report how holography and CDI can be merged into one\nsuperior technique: holographic coherent diffraction imaging (HCDI). An inline\nhologram can be recorded by employing a modified CDI experimental scheme. We\ndemonstrate that the amplitude of the Fourier transform of an inline hologram\nis related to the complex-valued visibility, thus providing information on\nboth, the amplitude and the phase of the scattered wave in the plane of the\ndiffraction pattern. With the phase information available, the condition of\noversampling the diffraction patterns can be relaxed, and the phase problem can\nbe solved in a fast and unambiguous manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 11:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 12:15:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 10:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-14"}

A series of snapshots from the dynamo models\nare cross-correlated to obtain the shift of the magnetic patterns at each\nlatitude and time point. The surface differential rotation patterns obtained\nfrom the snapshots of the dynamo calculations show in all studied cases\nvariability over the activity cycle. In the models using only the large scale\ndynamo field the measured rotation patterns are only at times similar to the\ninput rotation law. This is due to the spot motion being mainly determined by\nthe geometric properties of the large scale dynamo field. In the models with\nadditional small scale magnetic field the surface differential rotation\nmeasured from the model follows well the input rotation law. The results imply\nthat the stellar spots caused by the large scale dynamo field are not\nnecessarily tracing the stellar differential rotation, whereas the spots formed\nfrom small scale fields trace well the surface flow patterns. It can be\nquestioned whether the large spots observed in active stars could be caused by\nsmall scale fields.

Previous theoretical\npredictions of the ferromagnetic phase transition have been based on the\nperturbation theory, which treats the gas parameter as a small number. On the\nother hand, Belitz, Kirkpatrick, and Vojta (BKV) have argued that the phase\ntransition in clean itinerant ferromagnets is generically of first order at low\ntemperatures, due to the correlation effects that lead to a nonanalytic term in\nthe free energy. The second-order perturbation theory predicts a first-order\nphase transition at $(k_{\\rm F}a)_c=1.054$, consistent with the BKV argument.\nHowever, since the critical gas parameter is expected to be of order O(1),\nperturbative predictions may be unreliable. In this paper we study the\nnonperturbative effects on the ferromagnetic phase transition by summing the\nparticle-particle ladder diagrams to all orders in the gas parameter. We\nconsider a universal repulsive Fermi gas where the effective range effects can\nbe neglected, which can be realized in a two-component Fermi gas of $^6$Li\natoms by using a nonadiabatic field switch to the upper branch of a Feshbach\nresonance with a positive s-wave scattering length. Our theory predicts a\nsecond-order phase transition, which indicates that ferromagnetic transition in\ndilute Fermi gases is possibly a counterexample to the BKV argument.

An\nXMM-Newton validation observation has allowed us to confirm that the candidate\nis a bona fide galaxy cluster. With these X-ray data we measure an accurate\nredshift, z = 0.94 +/- 0.02, and estimate the cluster mass to be M_500 = (7.8\n+/- 0.8)e+14 solar masses. PLCK G266.6-27.3 is an exceptional system: its\nluminosity of L_X(0.5-2.0 keV)=(1.4 +/- 0.05)e+45 erg/s, equals that of the two\nmost luminous known clusters in the z > 0.5 universe, and it is one of the most\nmassive clusters at z~1. Moreover, unlike the majority of high-redshift\nclusters, PLCK G266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. This observation\nconfirms Planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,\nand opens the way to the systematic study of population evolution in the\nexponential tail of the mass function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 15:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 10:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 11:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A typical application is \\emph{shape fitting}, where we\nwish to approximate a set $P$ of $n$ elements (say, points) by a shape $x$ from\na (possibly infinite) family $X$ of shapes. Here, each point $p\\in P$\ncorresponds to a function $f$ such that $f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to $x$,\nand we seek a shape $x$ that minimizes the sum of distances from each point in\n$P$. In the $k$-clustering variant, each $x\\in X$ is a tuple of $k$ shapes, and\n$f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to its closest shape in $x$.\n  Our main result is a unified framework for constructing {\\em coresets} and\n{\\em approximate clustering} for such general sets of functions. To achieve our\nresults, we forge a link between the classic and well defined notion of\n$\\varepsilon$-approximations from the theory of PAC Learning and VC dimension,\nto the relatively new (and not so consistent) paradigm of coresets, which are\nsome kind of \"compressed representation\" of the input set $F$. Using\ntraditional techniques, a coreset usually implies an LTAS (linear time\napproximation scheme) for the corresponding optimization problem, which can be\ncomputed in parallel, via one pass over the data, and using only\npolylogarithmic space (i.e, in the streaming model).\n  We show how to generalize the results of our framework for squared distances\n(as in $k$-mean), distances to the $q$th power, and deterministic\nconstructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 15:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 03:27:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 20:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 28 May 2016 21:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

These data are intended to provide a\nbroad data base enabling a critical test of the validity of phenomenological\nand microscopic models for electrode polarization. In the present work, the\nresults are analyzed using a simple phenomenological equivalent-circuit\ndescription, involving a distributed parallel RC circuit element for the\nmodeling of the weakly conducting regions close to the electrodes. Excellent\nfits of the experimental data are achieved in this way, demonstrating the\nuniversal applicability of this approach. In the investigated ionically\nconducting materials, we find the universal appearance of a second dispersion\nregion due to electrode polarization, which is only revealed if measuring down\nto sufficiently low frequencies.
