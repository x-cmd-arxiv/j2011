We\nwant to outline a coherent description of Tycho's properties in terms of SNR\nevolution, shock hydrodynamics and multi-wavelength emission by accounting for\nparticle acceleration at the forward shock via first order Fermi mechanism. We\nadopt here a quick and reliable semi-analytical approach to non-linear\ndiffusive shock acceleration which includes magnetic field amplification due to\nresonant streaming instability and the dynamical backreaction on the shock of\nboth cosmic rays (CRs) and self-generated magnetic turbulence. We find that\nTycho's forward shock is accelerating protons up to at least 500 TeV,\nchannelling into CRs about the 10 per cent of its kinetic energy. Moreover, the\nCR-induced streaming instability is consistent with all the observational\nevidences indicating a very efficient magnetic field amplification (up to ~300\nmicro Gauss). In such a strong magnetic field the velocity of the Alfv\\'en\nwaves scattering CRs in the upstream is expected to be enhanced and to make\naccelerated particles feel an effective compression factor lower than 4, in\nturn leading to an energy spectrum steeper than the standard prediction\n{\\propto} E^-2. This latter effect is crucial to explain the GeV-to-TeV\ngamma-ray spectrum as due to the decay of neutral pions produced in nuclear\ncollisions between accelerated nuclei and the background gas. The\nself-consistency of such an hadronic scenario, along with the fact that the\nconcurrent leptonic mechanism cannot reproduce both the shape and the\nnormalization of the detected the gamma-ray emission, represents the first\nclear and direct radiative evidence that hadron acceleration occurs efficiently\nin young Galactic SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2011 17:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 15:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In this paper we study the problem of estimating the\nparameters that describe star formation history (SFH) in galaxies.

Theoretical data for each SSP is\nproduced for a fixed parameter vector via computer modeling. Though the\nparameters that define each SSP are continuous, optimizing the signal model\nover a large set of SSPs on a fine parameter grid is computationally infeasible\nand inefficient. The goal of this study is to estimate the set of parameters\nthat describes the SFH of each galaxy. These target parameters, such as the\naverage ages and chemical compositions of the galaxy's stellar populations, are\nderived from the SSP parameters and the component weights in the signal model.\nHere, we introduce a principled approach of choosing a small basis of SSP\nprototypes for SFH parameter estimation. The basic idea is to quantize the\nvector space and effective support of the model components. In addition to\ngreater computational efficiency, we achieve better estimates of the SFH target\nparameters. In simulations, our proposed quantization method obtains a\nsubstantial improvement in estimating the target parameters over the common\nmethod of employing a parameter grid.

Broadband foreground sources are\nexpected to be roughly four orders of magnitude larger than any cosmological\nsignals, so precise foreground models will be necessary. Such foreground models\noften contain a large number of parameters, reflecting the complicated physics\nthat governs foreground sources. In this paper, we concentrate on spectral\nmodeling (neglecting, for instance, bright point source removal from spatial\nmaps) and show that 21 cm tomography experiments will likely not be able to\nmeasure these parameters without large degeneracies, simply because the\nforeground spectra are so featureless and generic. However, we show that this\nis also an advantage, because it means that the foregrounds can be\ncharacterized to a high degree of accuracy once a small number of parameters\n(likely three or four, depending on one's instrumental specifications) are\nmeasured. This provides a simple understanding for why 21 cm foreground\nsubtraction schemes are able to remove most of the contaminants by suppressing\njust a small handful of simple spectral forms. In addition, this suggests that\nthe foreground modeling process should be relatively simple and will likely not\nbe an impediment to the foreground subtraction schemes that are necessary for a\nsuccessful 21 cm tomography experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2011 20:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 13:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 12:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-16"}

After correcting the\nline-of-sight velocities for the LMC's space motion and accounting for\nasymmetric drift in the AGB population, we derive a rotation curve that is\nconsistent with all of the tracers used, as well as that of published HI data.\nThe amplitude of the rotation curve is v_0=87+/-5 km s^-1 beyond a radius\nR_0=2.4+/-0.1 kpc, and has a position angle of the kinematic line of nodes of\ntheta=142 degrees +/-5 degrees. By examining the outliers from our fits, we\nidentify a population of 376 stars, or >~5% of our sample, that have\nline-of-sight velocities that apparently oppose the sense of rotation of the\nLMC disk. We find that these kinematically distinct stars are either\ncounter-rotating in a plane closely aligned with the LMC disk, or rotating in\nthe same sense as the LMC disk, but in a plane that is inclined by 54 degrees\n+/- 2 degrees to the LMC. Their kinematics clearly link them to two known HI\narms, which have previously been interpreted as being pulled out from the LMC.\nWe measure metallicities from the Ca triplet lines of ~1000 LMC field stars and\n30 stars in the kinematically distinct population. For the LMC field, we find a\nmedian [Fe/H]=-0.56 +/- 0.02 with dispersion of 0.5 dex, while for the\nkinematically distinct stars the median [Fe/H] is -1.25 +/- 0.13 with a\ndispersion of 0.7 dex. The metallicity differences provide strong evidence that\nthe kinematically distinct population originated in the SMC. This\ninterpretation has the consequence that the HI arms kinematically associated\nwith the stars are likely falling into the LMC, instead of being pulled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2011 22:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

The\nclass of scalar-tensor theories, which includes f(R) gravity, predict such a\nforce enhancement (massive galaxies like the Milky Way can evade it through a\nscreening mechanism that protects the interior of the galaxy from this \"fifth\"\nforce). We study observable deviations from GR in the disks of late-type dwarf\ngalaxies moving under gravity. The fifth-force acts on the dark matter and HI\ngas disk, but not on the stellar disk owing to the self-screening of main\nsequence stars. We find four distinct observable effects in such disk galaxies:\n1. A displacement of the stellar disk from the HI disk. 2. Warping of the\nstellar disk along the direction of the external force. 3. Enhancement of the\nrotation curve measured from the HI gas compared to that of the stellar disk.\n4. Asymmetry in the rotation curve of the stellar disk. We estimate that the\nspatial effects can be up to 1 kpc and the rotation velocity effects about 10\nkm/s in infalling dwarf galaxies. Such deviations are measurable: we expect\nthat with a careful analysis of a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies one can\nimprove astrophysical constraints on gravity theories by over three orders of\nmagnitude, and even solar system constraints by one order of magnitude.

The performance is\ngood both asymptotically, since the belief propagation thresholds approach\ncapacity, as well as for finite lengths, since degree-2 variables that result\nin high error floors can be completely avoided. However, to realize the\npromised good performance, one needs large blocklengths. This in turn implies a\nlarge latency and decoding complexity. For the memoryless binary erasure\nchannel, we consider the decoding of spatially coupled codes through a windowed\ndecoder that aims to retain many of the attractive features of belief\npropagation, while trying to reduce complexity further. We characterize the\nperformance of this scheme by defining thresholds on channel erasure rates that\nguarantee a target erasure rate.

The present work uses the Lorenz 096 coupled system, a simplified\nnonlinear model of atmospheric dynamics, to extend a recently developed\ntechnique for lengthening the shadowing time of a dynamical system. Ensemble\nforecasting is used to make forecasts with and without inflation, a method\nwhereby the ensemble is regularly expanded artificially along dimensions whose\nuncertainty is contracting. The first goal of this work is to compare model\nforecasts, with and without inflation, to a true trajectory created by\nintegrating a modified version of the same model. The second goal is to\nestablish whether inflation can increase the maximum shadowing time for a\nsingle optimal member of the ensemble. In the second experiment the true\ntrajectory is known a priori, and only the closest ensemble members are\nretained at each time step, a technique known as stalking. Finally, a targeted\ninflation is introduced to both techniques to reduce the number of instances in\nwhich inflation occurs in directions likely to be incommensurate with the true\ntrajectory. Results varied for inflation, with success dependent upon the\nexperimental design parameters (e.g. size of state space, inflation amount).\nHowever, a more targeted inflation successfully reduced the number of forecast\ndegradations without significantly reducing the number of forecast\nimprovements. Utilized appropriately, inflation has the potential to improve\npredictions of the future state of atmospheric phenomena, as well as other\nphysical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 03:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 21:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In this paper, we use\ngrid-adaptive numerical simulations of the radiative hydrodynamic equations to\nparametrically investigate the filament formation process in a pre-shaped loop\nwith both steady and finite-time chromospheric heating. Compared to previous\nworks, we consider low-lying loops with shallow dips, and use a more realistic\ndescription for the radiative losses. We demonstrate for the first time that\nthe onset of thermal instability satisfies the linear instability criterion.\nThe onset time of the condensation is roughly \\sim 2 hr or more after the\nlocalized heating at the footpoint is effective, and the growth rate of the\nthread length varies from 800 km hr-1 to 4000 km hr-1, depending on the\namplitude and the decay length scale characterizing this localized\nchromospheric heating. We show how single or multiple condensation segments may\nform in the coronal portion. In the asymmetric heating case, when two segments\nform, they approach and coalesce, and the coalesced condensation later drains\ndown into the chromosphere. With a steady heating, this process repeats with a\nperiodicity of several hours. While our parametric survey confirms and augments\nearlier findings, we also point out that steady heating is not necessary to\nsustain the condensation. Once the condensation is formed, it can keep growing\nalso when the localized heating ceases. Finally, we show that the condensation\ncan survive continuous buffeting by perturbations resulting from the\nphotospheric p-mode waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 05:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We first consider the gathering problem, which requires\nall robots to meet in finite time at a non-predefined location. It is known\nthat the solvability of Byzantine gathering strongly depends on a number of\nsystem attributes, such as synchrony, the number of Byzantine robots,\nscheduling strategy, obliviousness, orientation of local coordinate systems and\nso on. However, the complete characterization of the attributes making\nByzantine gathering solvable still remains open.\n  In this paper, we show strong impossibility results of Byzantine gathering.\nNamely, we prove that Byzantine gathering is impossible even if we assume one\nByzantine fault, an atomic execution system, the n-bounded centralized\nscheduler, non-oblivious robots, instantaneous movements and a common\norientation of local coordinate systems (where n denote the number of correct\nrobots). Those hypotheses are much weaker than used in previous work, inducing\na much stronger impossibility result.\n  At the core of our impossibility result is a reduction from the distributed\nconsensus problem in asynchronous shared-memory systems.

A super-hydrophobic wall is characterized by\nparameters $L$ (texture characteristic length), $b_1$ and $b_2$ (local slip\nlengths at solid and gas areas), and $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ (fractions of solid\nand gas areas). Hydrodynamic properties of the plane are fully expressed in\nterms of the effective slip-length tensor with eigenvalues that depend on\ntexture parameters and $H$ (local separation). The effect of effective slip is\npredicted to decrease the force as compared with expected for two hydrophilic\nsurfaces and described by the Taylor equation. The presence of additional\nlength scales, $L$, $b_1$ and $b_2$, implies that a film drainage can be much\nricher than in case of a sphere moving towards a hydrophilic plane. For a large\n(compared to $L$) gap the reduction of the force is small, and for all textures\nthe force is similar to expected when a sphere is moving towards a smooth\nhydrophilic plane that is shifted down from the super-hydrophobic wall. The\nvalue of this shift is equal to the average of the eigenvalues of the\nslip-length tensor. By analyzing striped super-hydrophobic surfaces, we then\ncompute the correction to the Taylor equation for an arbitrary gap. We show\nthat at thinner gap the force reduction becomes more pronounced, and that it\ndepends strongly on the fraction of the gas area and local slip lengths. For\nsmall separations we derive an exact equation, which relates a correction for\neffective slip to texture parameters. Our analysis provides a framework for\ninterpreting recent force measurements in the presence of super-hydrophobic\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 08:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}

The well-established\ndefinition for non-Markovianity of a classical stochastic process represents a\ncondition on the Kolmogorov hierarchy of the n-point joint probability\ndistributions. Since this definition cannot be transferred to the quantum\nregime, quantum non-Markovianity has recently been defined and quantified in\nterms of the underlying quantum dynamical map, using either its divisibility\nproperties or the behavior of the trace distance between pairs of initial\nstates. Here, we investigate and compare these definitions and their relations\nto the classical notion of non-Markovianity by employing a large class of\nnon-Markovian processes, known as semi-Markov processes, which admit a natural\nextension to the quantum case. A number of specific physical examples is\nconstructed which allow to study the basic features of the classical and the\nquantum definitions and to evaluate explicitly the measures for quantum\nnon-Markovianity. Our results clearly demonstrate several fundamental\ndistinctions between the classical and the quantum notion of non-Markovianity,\nas well as between the various quantum measures for non-Markovianity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 10:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-06"}

The model\nsuccessfully reproduces the observed switching rate as a function of the\nrotation speed, and provides a generic physical explanation independent of most\ndetails. A stator affects the switching dynamics through two mechanisms:\naccelerating the conformation flipping rates of individual rotor switching\nunits, which favours slower motor speed and thus increasing torque; and\naffecting more switching units within unit time, which favours faster speed.\nConsequently, the switching rate shows a maximum at intermediate speed. Our\nmodel predicts that a motor switches more often with more stators.

In consequence, a key part of the\ntheory is a set of equations, which provides the gradient of the merit function\nwith respect to parameters that control the shape of the driving field. We show\nthat these equations can be straightforwardly derived using the standard linear\nresponse theory, only requiring a minor generalization -- the unperturbed\nHamiltonian is allowed to be time-dependent. As a result, the aforementioned\ngradients are identified with certain response functions. This identification\nleads to a natural reformulation of QOCT in term of the Keldysh contour\nformalism of the quantum many-body theory. In particular, the gradients of the\nmerit function can be calculated using the diagrammatic technique for\nnon-equilibrium Green's functions, which should be helpful in the application\nof QOCT to computationally difficult many-electron problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 13:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-19"}

The point source was also detected in follow-up higher\nfrequency(1170 MHz) observations. The spectral index for the point source\nobtained from the GMRT observations is alpha = -2.1. The steep spectrum, as\nwell as the location of the point source near the centre of the SNR establish\nthe fact that it is indeed the pulsar J2022+3842 associated with this SNR.\nConsistent with this, subsequent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray data shows\na point source coincident with the radio point source, as well as diffuse\nextended X-ray emission surrounding the unresolved source. However, no pulsed\nemission was detected despite deep searches at both 610 MHz and 1160 MHz\nalthough pulsed emission has been seen at 2 GHz with the GBT. It appears that\nthe most likely reason for not detecting the pulsed signal at the GMRT is\ntemporal broadening: for the estimated DM towards this SNR, the pulse\nbroadening time could be as large as tens of milliseconds. The diffuse X-ray\nemission is elongated along the same direction as the bipolar structure seen in\nthe radio. We interpret the radio lobes as having been formed from an\nequatorial wind.

Remarkably,\nall these correlation functions exhibit spatial power-law behaviors, sharing a\nsingle underlying universal critical exponent for each type of dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 14:54:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2011 21:13:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 05:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 07:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

It is generally accepted that they cannot host\nblack holes as large as those associated with active galaxies, but they appear\nto be significantly more luminous than their better understood Galactic X-ray\nbinary (XRB) cousins, while displaying an intriguing combination of differences\nand similarities with them. Through studying large, representative samples of\nthese sources we may hope to enhance our understanding of them. To this end, we\nderive a large catalogue of 650 X-ray detections of 470 ULX candidates, located\nin 238 nearby galaxies, by cross correlating the 2XMM Serendipitous Survey with\nthe Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies. The presented dedicated\ncatalogue offers a significant improvement over those previously published both\nin terms of number and the contribution of background contaminants, e.g.\ndistant quasars, which we estimate to be at most 24 per cent, but more likely\n~17 per cent. To undertake population studies, we define a `complete'\nsub-sample of sources compiled from observations of galaxies with sensitivity\nlimits below 10^39 erg/s. The luminosity function of this sample is consistent\nwith a simple power-law. Although we do not find any statistical requirement\nfor a high luminosity cut-off, as has been reported previously, we are not able\nto rule out its presence. Also, we find that the number of ULXs per unit galaxy\nmass decreases with increasing galaxy mass for ULXs associated with spiral\ngalaxies, in broad agreement with previous results, but is consistent with\nbeing constant with galaxy mass for sources associated with elliptical\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 15:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This entails finding a (set of) boolean function(s) F (typically\nrepresented using OBDDs, Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams) such that: 1) for\nall x for which K is satisfiable, K(x, F(x)) = 1 holds; 2) the implementation\nof F is efficient with respect to given implementation parameters such as code\nsize or execution time. While this problem has been widely studied in digital\nhardware synthesis, little has been done in a software synthesis context.\nUnfortunately the approaches developed for hardware synthesis cannot be\ndirectly used in a software context. This motivates investigation of effective\nmethods to solve the above problem when F has to be implemented with software.\nIn this paper we present an algorithm that, from an OBDD representation for K,\ngenerates a C code implementation for F that has the same size as the OBDD for\nF and a WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) at most O(nr), being n = |x| the\nnumber of arguments of functions in F and r the number of functions in F.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 12:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 10:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 07:47:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 08:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-23"}
