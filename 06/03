The specific heat below T2\nconsists of a normal metallic component from the ungapped parts of the Fermi\nsurface, and a Bardeen-Cooper- Schrieffer (BCS) component that represents the\nSDW gapping of the Fermi surface.

The thermal conductivity of CaFe4As3 is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than those of conventional metals at all temperatures, due to\na strong phonon scattering. The thermoelectric power displays a sign change\nfrom positive to negative indicating that a partial gap forms at the Fermi\nlevel with the onset of commensurate spin density wave order at T2=26.4 K.

While the conditions for fragmentation have\nbeen extensively studied, little is known of the subsequent evolution of these\ngiant planet embryos, in particular their expected orbital migration. Assuming\na single planet has formed by fragmentation, we investigate its interaction\nwith the gravitoturbulent disc it is embedded in. Two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations are used with a simple prescription for the disc\ncooling. A steady gravitoturbulent disc is first set up, after which\nsimulations are restarted including a planet with a range of masses\napproximately equal to the clump's initial mass expected in fragmenting discs.\nPlanets rapidly migrate inwards, despite the stochastic kicks due to the\nturbulent density fluctuations. We show that the migration timescale is\nessentially that of type I migration, with the planets having no time to open a\ngap. In discs with aspect ratio ~ 0.1 at their forming location, planets with a\nmass comparable to, or larger than Jupiter's can migrate in as short as 10000\nyears, that is, about 10 orbits at 100 AU. Massive planets formed at large\nseparation from their star by gravitational instability are thus unlikely to\nstay in place, and should rapidly migrate towards the inner parts of\nprotoplanetary discs, regardless of the planet mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 19:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Using the Spitzer observations of\nCOSMOS we determined the fraction of luminous star-forming galaxies at 1.5<z<3\nescaping the traditional color selection techniques because of dust extinction,\nas well as their contribution to the cosmic star formation density at high\nredshift. We find that the BzK criterion offers an almost complete (~90%)\nidentification of the 24mic sources at 1.4<z<2.5, while the BM/BX criterion\nmiss 50% of the MIPS population. Similarly the criterion based on the presence\nof a stellar bump in massive sources (so-called \"IRAC peakers\") miss up to 40%\nof the IR luminosity density and only 25% of the IR energy density at z~2 is\nproduced by Optically-Faint IR-bright galaxies selected based on their extreme\nmid-IR to optical flux ratios.

A supply of gas undergoing collapse and rapid expansion is therefore the\nessential ingredient.

We also present detailed physical insight by\nexamining strain profiles, band edges diagrams and wave function plots.\nMulti-directional PL measurements and calculations of the DOP reveal a unique\nproperty of InAs quantum dot stacks that the TE response is anisotropic in the\nplane of the stacks. Therefore a single value of the DOP is not sufficient to\nfully characterize the polarization response. We explain this anisotropy of the\nTE-modes by orientation of hole wave functions along the [-110] direction. Our\nresults provide a new insight that isotropic polarization response measured in\nthe experimental PL spectra is due to two factors: (i) TM[001]-mode\ncontributions increase due to enhanced intermixing of HH and LH bands, and (ii)\nTE[110]-mode contributions reduce significantly due to hole wave function\nalignment along the [-110] direction. We also present optical spectra for\nvarious geometry configurations of quantum dot stacks to provide a guide to\nexperimentalists for the design of multi-layer QD stacks for optical devices.\nOur results predict that the QD stacks with identical layers will exhibit lower\nvalues of the DOP than the stacks with non-identical layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 21:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-26"}

Revisiting this issue using high-resolution\ncosmological hydrodynamics simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, we find\nthat at the time of accretion, gas and dark matter do carry a similar amount of\nspecific angular momentum, but that it is systematically higher than that of\nthe dark matter halo as a whole. At high redshift, freshly accreted gas rapidly\nstreams into the central region of the halo, directly depositing this large\namount of angular momentum within a sphere of radius r=0.1rvir. In contrast,\ndark matter particles pass through the central region unscathed, and a fraction\nof them ends up populating the outer regions of the halo (r/rvir>0.1),\nredistributing angular momentum in the process. As a result, large-scale\nmotions of the cosmic web have to be considered as the origin of gas angular\nmomentum rather than its virialised dark matter halo host. This generic result\nholds for halos of all masses at all redshifts, as radiative cooling ensures\nthat a significant fraction of baryons remain trapped at the centre of the\nhalos. Despite this injection of angular momentum enriched gas, we predict an\namount for stellar discs which is in fair agreement with observations at z=0.\nThis arises because the total specific angular momentum of the baryons remains\nclose to that of dark matter halos. We propose a new scenario where gas\nefficiently carries the angular momentum generated by large-scale structure\nmotions deep inside dark matter halos, redistributing it only in the vicinity\nof the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 00:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-06"}

We use a\nthree-phase model (gas/surface/mantle) to simulate the coupled gas--grain\nchemistry, allowing the distinction of the chemically-active surface from the\nice layers preserved in the mantle beneath. The model includes a treatment of\nthe competition between barrier-mediated surface reactions and thermal-hopping\nprocesses. The results show excellent agreement with the observed behavior of\nCO2, CO and water ice in the interstellar medium. The reaction of the OH\nradical with CO is found to be efficient enough to account for CO2 ice\nproduction in dark clouds. At low visual extinctions, with dust temperatures\n~12 K, CO2 is formed by direct diffusion and reaction of CO with OH; we\nassociate the resultant CO2-rich ice with the observational polar CO2\nsignature. CH4 ice is well correlated with this component. At higher\nextinctions, with lower dust temperatures, CO is relatively immobile and thus\nabundant; however, the reaction of H and O atop a CO molecule allows OH and CO\nto meet rapidly enough to produce a CO:CO2 ratio in the range ~2--4, which we\nassociate with apolar signatures. We suggest that the observational apolar\nCO2/CO ice signatures in dark clouds result from a strongly segregated CO:H2O\nice, in which CO2 resides almost exclusively within the CO component. Observed\nvisual-extinction thresholds for CO2, CO and H2O are well reproduced by\ndepth-dependent models.

This paper aims to\ndevelop a more general formalism that can be used to both clearly define the\nlimitations of the matrix RIME, and to describe observational scenarios that\nlie outside these limitations. Some assumptions underlying the matrix RIME are\nexplicated and analysed in detail. To this purpose, an array correlation matrix\n(ACM) formalism is explored. This proves of limited use; it is shown that\nmatrix algebra is simply not a sufficiently flexible tool for the job. To\novercome these limitations, a more general formalism based on tensors and the\nEinstein notation is proposed and explored both theoretically, and with a view\nto practical implementations. The tensor formalism elegantly yields generalized\nRIMEs describing beamforming, mutual coupling, and wide-field polarimetry in\none equation. It is shown that under the explicated assumptions, tensor\nequations reduce to the 2x2 RIME. From a practical point of view, some methods\nfor implementing tensor equations in an optimal way are proposed and analysed.\nThe tensor RIME is a powerful means of describing observational scenarios not\namenable to the matrix RIME.

In essence, energy loss models are\neffectively only probed in the vicinity of zero energy loss and as a result,\nonly the pathlength dependence of energy loss offers some discriminating power\nat RHIC kinematics. At LHC, this is no longer the case: Due to the much flatter\nshape of the parton spectra originating from 2.76 AGeV collisions, the\navailable observables probe much deeper into the model dynamics.

We discuss (in brief) the most important results of turbulent\n(re)acceleration models, the open problems, and the possibilities to test\nmodels with future observations. In this respect, further constraints on the\norigin of giant nearby radio halos can also be obtained by combining their\n(spectral and morphological) properties with the constraints from gamma-ray\nobservations of their parent clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 09:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The missing ERCSC sources are typically associated with the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud, the Milky Way or are otherwise extended. The spectral\nanalysis of the PACO faint catalogue shows a spectral steepening of the sources\nat high frequencies, confirming the results obtained from the PACO bright\nsample. A comparison with AT20G measurements, carried out, on average, a few\nyears earlier, has demonstrated that, on these timescales, our sources show a\nrather high variability with an rms amplitude of ~40 per cent at 20 GHz. The\nsource spectral properties are found not to vary substantially with flux\ndensity, except for an increase of the fraction of steep spectrum sources at\nfainter flux densities.

The same holds true for the perturbation to the\nparticle number density. These facts exclude all definitions of gauge-invariant\nquantities used to describe density perturbations in former theories. Using\nthese two new quantities, a manifestly covariant and gauge-invariant\ncosmological perturbation theory, adapted to non-barotropic equations of state\nfor the pressure, has been developed. The new theory is valid for all scales\nsince metric gradients do not occur in the final evolution equations. The new\ntheory has an exact non-relativistic limit with a time-independent Newtonian\npotential. The usual Newtonian perturbation theory is inadequate to study the\nevolution of density perturbations. In the radiation-dominated era,\nperturbations in the particle number density are gravitationally coupled to\nperturbations in the total energy density, irrespective of the nature of the\nparticles. This implies that structure formation can commence only after\ndecoupling of matter and radiation.

The taxonomy has to be easily interpreted and present\nthe most relevant information about extra-solar planets. I propose the\nfollowing the extra-solar planet taxonomy scale with four parameters. The first\nparameter concerns the mass of an extra-solar planet in the form of the units\nof the mass of other known planets, where M represents the mass of Mercury, E\nthat of Earth, N Neptune, and J Jupiter. The second parameter is the planet's\ndistance from its parent star (semi-major axis) described in logarithm with\nbase 10. The third parameter is the mean Dyson temperature of the extra-solar\nplanet, for which I established four main temperature classes; F represents the\nFreezing class, W the Water Class, G the Gaseous Class, and R the Roasters\nClass.

We used tracers of\nthe Doppler shifts, such as the location of the absorption core, the ratio of\nthe two emission peaks H2V and H2R, and intensity images at a fixed wavelength.\nThe average off-limb profiles show a smooth variation with increasing limb\ndistance. The line width increases up to a height of about 2 Mm above the limb.\nThe profile shape is fairly symmetric with nearly identical H2V and H2R\nintensities; at a height of 5 Mm, it changes into a single Gaussian without\nemission peaks.

Our main result is the following upper bound on\ntheir number: ((1+o(1))(n/e^d))^(n^d).\n  We tend to believe that this is actually the correct number, but the problem\nof proving the complementary lower bound remains open. Our main tool is an\nadaptation of Bregman's proof of the Minc conjecture on permanents. More\nconcretely, our approach is very close in spirit to Radhakrishnan's proof of\nBregman's theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 06:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-13"}

The magnetism of\nCeFeAsO changes drastically upon P substitution on the As site. CeFePO is a\nheavy fermion system without long range order whereas CeFeAsO exhibits a\nFe-3$d$ SDW type of ordering accompanied by a structural transition from\ntetragonal ($TT$) to orthorhombic ($OT$) structure. Furthermore Ce-4$f^{1}$\norders antiferromagnetically (AFM) at low temperature. At the critical\nconcentration where the Fe-magnetism is diminished the Ce-Ce interaction\nchanges to a ferromagnetic (FM) type of ordering. Three representative samples\nof the CeFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O ($x$=0.05, 0.3 and 0.9) series are systematically\ninvestigated. 1) For the $x$=0.05 alloy a drastic change of the line width at\n130 K indicates the AFM-SDW type of ordering of Fe and the structural change\nfrom $TT$ to $OT$ phase. The line width roughly measures the internal field in\nthe ordered state and the transition is most likely first order. The small and\nnearly constant shift for $^{31}$P and $^{75}$As suggests the presence of\ncompeting hyperfine interactions between the nuclear spins and the 4$f$ and\n3$d$ ions of Ce and Fe. 2) For the $x$=0.3 alloy, evolution of the Fe-SDW type\norder takes place at around 70 K corroborating the results of bulk measurement\nand $\\mu SR$. Here we found strong evidence for phase separation of\nparamagnetic and magnetic SDW phases. 3) In contrast to heavy fermion CeFePO\nfor the $x$=0.9 alloy a phase transition is found at 2 K. The field-dependent\nNMR shift gives strong evidence of FM ordering. Above the ordering the spin\nlattice relaxation rate $^{31}$(1/T$_{1}$) shows unconventional, non-Korringa\nlike behaviour which indicates a complex interplay of Kondo and FM\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:33:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Reduced Error Pruning is an\nalgorithm that has been used as a representative technique in attempts to\nexplain the problems of decision tree learning. In this paper we present\nanalyses of Reduced Error Pruning in three different settings. First we study\nthe basic algorithmic properties of the method, properties that hold\nindependent of the input decision tree and pruning examples. Then we examine a\nsituation that intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be\nreplaced by a leaf node, one in which the class label and attribute values of\nthe pruning examples are independent of each other. This analysis is conducted\nunder two different assumptions. The general analysis shows that the pruning\nprobability of a node fitting pure noise is bounded by a function that\ndecreases exponentially as the size of the tree grows. In a specific analysis\nwe assume that the examples are distributed uniformly to the tree. This\nassumption lets us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because\nthey do not receive any pruning examples. This paper clarifies the different\nvariants of the Reduced Error Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its\nalgorithmic properties, analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions\nthan before, and includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-06"}

In the last five years, several such local consistencies have been\nproposed by us or by others. We make an overview of all of them, and highlight\nsome relations between them.

Our contributions in this paper are twofold. In\nterms of probabilistic inference, we introduce the Abstract Hidden Markov Model\n(AHMM), a novel type of stochastic processes, provide its dynamic Bayesian\nnetwork (DBN) structure and analyse the properties of this network. We then\ndescribe an application of the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter to the AHMM\nwhich allows us to construct an efficient, hybrid inference method for this\nmodel. In terms of plan recognition, we propose a novel plan recognition\nframework based on the AHMM as the plan execution model. The Rao-Blackwellised\nhybrid inference for AHMM can take advantage of the independence properties\ninherent in a model of plan execution, leading to an algorithm for online\nprobabilistic plan recognition that scales well with the number of levels in\nthe plan hierarchy. This illustrates that while stochastic models for plan\nexecution can be complex, they exhibit special structures which, if exploited,\ncan lead to efficient plan recognition algorithms. We demonstrate the\nusefulness of the AHMM framework via a behaviour recognition system in a\ncomplex spatial environment using distributed video surveillance data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-06"}

The quark contributions to the\nDyson-Schwinger equations are derived and one-loop perturbative results for the\ntwo-point functions are presented. The problem of confinement is addressed in\nthe heavy quark limit, by rewriting the generating functional of quantum\nchromodynamics in terms of a heavy quark mass expansion. By restricting to\nleading order in this expansion and considering only the two-point functions of\nthe Yang-Mills sector, the rainbow-ladder approximation to the gap and\nBethe-Salpeter equations is shown to be exact. Analytic nonperturbative\nsolutions to the Bethe-Salpeter equation for quark-antiquark bound states and\nFaddeev equation for three-quark bound states, in the case of equal quark\nseparations, are presented. The quark-antiquark and three-quark confining\npotentials are derived and a direct connection between the temporal gluon\npropagator and the corresponding string tensions is found. It is shown that\nonly color singlet of quark-antiquark (meson) and qqq (baryon) states are\nphysically allowed. Moreover, the four-point Green's functions, in both\nquark-antiquark and diquark channels, are explicitly derived. It is found that\nthe corresponding poles relate to the bound state energy of the heavy quark\nsystems, and a natural separation between physical and unphysical poles in the\nGreen's functions emerges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 15:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-06"}

Taking into\naccount the selection effects that result from dust extinction, including the\nreduction in the signal-to-noise ratio of an absorber appearing in a reddened\nquasar spectrum, we find a stronger dependence of E(B-V) on absorber rest\nequivalent width (EW) than in other published work. The dependence of the\nmedian reddening on EW can be reproduced by a power-law model:\nE(B-V)=.8+/-3*10-4 * EW^(3.48+/-0.3) for 1.0A<EW<5.0A. Observed Mg II samples,\nderived from flux-limited quasar surveys, are shown to suffer from significant\nincompleteness at the level of 24+/-4 per cent for absorbers with EW>1A and\n34+/-2 per cent for absorbers with EW>2A. Direct determination of the shape of\nthe near-ultraviolet extinction curves for absorbers as a function of E(B-V)\nshow evidence for systematic changes in the form of the extinction curves. At\nlow E(B-V) (>0.05), the extinction curve is well represented by a Small\nMagellanic Cloud-like extinction curve. For intermediate E(B-V)s (<0.2),\napproximately a third of MgII absorbers show evidence for a 2175A feature\nsimilar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud. For the small number of high\nE(B-V) (>0.3) absorbers, the majority of which exhibit strong CaII 3935,3970\nabsorption, there is evidence for a 2175A feature as strong as that found in\nthe Milky Way.
