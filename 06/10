In particular, free-space\noptical detection methods for single atoms and ions such as the shelving\ntechnique, though being among the most sensitive detection methods in quantum\nphysics, inevitably require spontaneous scattering, even in the dispersive\nregime. This causes heating, a limitation for atom-based quantum information\nprocessing where it obviates straightforward reuse of the qubit. No such energy\nexchange is required by quantum mechanics. Here we experimentally demonstrate\noptical detection of an atomic qubit with significantly less than one\nspontaneous scattering event. We measure transmission and reflection of an\noptical cavity containing the atom. In addition to the qubit detection itself,\nwe quantitatively measure how much spontaneous scattering has occurred. This\nallows us to relate the information gained to the amount of spontaneous\nemission, and we obtain a detection error below 10% while scattering less than\n0.2 photons on average. Furthermore, we perform a quantum Zeno type experiment\nto quantify the measurement back action and find that every incident photon\nleads to an almost complete state collapse. Together, these results constitute\na full experimental characterization of a quantum measurement in the \"energy\nexchange-free\" regime below a single spontaneous emission event. Besides its\nfundamental interest, this means significant simplification for proposed\nneutral-atom quantum computation schemes and may enable sensitive detection of\nmolecules and atoms lacking closed transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 16:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-10"}

For the analogous Rosenbluth algorithm, which samples unconfined\nself-avoiding walks of length n, the variance of the corresponding estimator is\nbelieved to be exponential in n.

The origin of this enigmatic dichotomy has\nbeen debated for over forty years, but with new data, a clearer picture is\nemerging. Motivated by Cassini radar and imaging observations, we investigate\nSoter's model of dark exogenous dust striking an originally brighter Iapetus by\nmodeling the dynamics of the dark dust from the ring of the exterior retrograde\nsatellite Phoebe under the relevant perturbations. In particular, we study the\nparticles' probabilities of striking Iapetus, as well as their expected spatial\ndistribution on the Iapetian surface. We find that, of the long-lived particles\n(greater than about 5 microns), most particle sizes (greater than about 10\nmicrons) are virtually certain to strike Iapetus, and their calculated\ndistribution on the surface matches up well with Cassini Regio's extent in its\nlongitudinal span. The satellite's polar regions are observed to be bright,\npresumably because ice is deposited there. Thus, in the latitudinal direction\nwe estimate polar dust deposition rates to help constrain models of thermal\nmigration invoked to explain the bright poles (Spencer & Denk 2010). We also\nanalyze dust originating from other irregular outer moons, determining that a\nsignificant fraction of that material will eventually coat Iapetus--perhaps\nexplaining why the spectrum of Iapetus' dark material differs somewhat from\nthat of Phoebe. Finally we track the dust particles that do not strike Iapetus,\nand find that most land on Titan, with a smaller fraction hitting Hyperion.

While galactic supernovae can be\nresolved with this technique, the supernova neutrino emission spectrum remains\nunconstrained and thus presents a limited potential for the topics related to\nsupernova core collapse models.\n  The paper elaborates analytically on the capabilities of IceCube to detect\nsupernovae through the analysis of hits in the detector correlated in space and\ntime. These arise from supernova neutrinos interacting in the instrumented\ndetector volume along single strings. Although the effective detection volume\nfor such coincidental hits is much smaller ($\\gtrsim 35\\,$kton, about the scale\nof SuperK), a wealth of information is obtained due to the comparatively low\ncoincidental noise rate.

In the radiation and dark matter\ndominated stages, the expansion of the Universe decelerates while the inflation\nand dark energy eras are accelerating regimes. So far there is no clear cut\nconnection between these accelerating periods. More intriguing, the substance\ndriving the present accelerating stage remains a mystery, and the best\navailable candidate (vacuum energy density) is plagued with the coincidence and\ncosmological constant problems. In this paper we overcome such problems through\nan alternative cosmic scenario based on gravitationally-induced particle\nproduction. The model proposed here is non-singular with the space-time\nemerging from a pure initial de Sitter stage thereby providing a natural\nsolution to the horizon problem. Subsequently, due to an instability provoked\nby the production of massless particles, the Universe evolves smoothly to the\nstandard radiation dominated era thereby ending the production of radiation as\nrequired by the conformal invariance (Parker's theorem). Next, the radiation\nbecomes subdominant with the Universe entering in the cold dark matter\ndominated era. Finally, the negative pressure associated with the creation of\ncold dark matter particles accelerates the expansion and drives the Universe to\na final de Sitter stage. The late time cosmic expansion history is exactly like\nin the standard LCDM model, however, there is no dark energy. The model evolves\nbetween two limiting (early and late time) de Sitter regimes. Our scenario is\nfully determined by two extreme energy densities, or equivalently, the\nassociated de Sitter Hubble scales connected by 122 orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 01:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-13"}

We also provide antimonotone operators for both\nADL and NDL, each based on the Gelfond-Lifschitz (GL) operator for logic\nprograms. For defeasible theories without defeaters or priorities on rules, the\noperator for ADL corresponds to the GL operator and so can be seen as partially\ncapturing the consequences according to ADL. Similarly, the operator for NDL\ncaptures the consequences according to NDL, though in this case no restrictions\non theories apply. Both operators can be used to define stable model semantics\nfor defeasible theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 05:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-13"}

An exciton initially localized in one chromophore first\nspreads coherently to neighboring chromophores. During this initial coherent\nspreading, quantum effects such as entanglement play a role.

This can be difficult for instruments that do not feature a\ncalibration plan for such high precision measurements. Here, it is not always\nobvious how to de-correlate the data using auxiliary information of the\ninstrument and it becomes paramount to know how well one can disentangle\ninstrument systematics from one's data, given nothing but the data itself. We\npropose a non-parametric machine learning algorithm, based on the concept of\nindependent component analysis, to de-convolve the systematic noise and all\nnon-Gaussian signals from the desired astrophysical signal. Such a `blind'\nsignal de-mixing is commonly known as the `Cocktail Party problem' in\nsignal-processing.

In this paper, we\nexplore these signal extraction techniques using simulated data and two data\nsets observed with the Hubble-NICMOS instrument. Another important application\nis the de-correlation of the exoplanetary signal from time-correlated stellar\nvariability. Using data obtained by the Kepler mission we show that the desired\nsignal can be de-convolved from the stellar noise using a single time series\nspanning several eclipse events. Such non-parametric techniques can provide\nimportant confirmations of the existent parametric corrections reported in the\nliterature, and their associated results. Additionally they can substantially\nimprove the precision exoplanetary light curve analysis in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 09:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 16:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This interesting configuration had\nled to different speculations such as dynamical ejection of the B-stars from\nthe central cluster or triggered star formation in a cloud that was swept up in\nthe collision zone between the two expanding HII regions. The presence or\nabsence of low-mass stars associated with these B-stars can discriminate\nbetween the possible scenarios. We performed a deep Chandra X-ray observation\nof the S254-S258 region in order to efficiently discriminate young stars from\nthe numerous older field stars in the area.

This number agrees well with the\nexpectation for the low-mass population associated to the B-stars in S255 and\nS257 as predicted by an IMF extrapolation.

Compared to\nold stellar populations, young populations release a higher fraction of their\ntotal luminosity in the UV, making them a good source of the energetic UV\nphotons that can power dust emission. However, given their relative abundance,\nthe question of whether young or old stellar populations provide most of these\nphotons that power the infrared emission is an interesting question. Using\nthree samples of galaxies observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope and our\ndusty radiative transfer model, we find that young stellar populations (on the\norder of 100 million years old) dominate the dust heating in star forming\ngalaxies, and old stellar populations (13 billion years old) generally\ncontribute less than 20% of the far-IR luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 10:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In this\nreview, we discuss different techniques for sensitive position detection and we\ngive an overview of the cooling techniques that are being employed. The latter\ninclude sideband cooling and active feedback cooling. The basic concepts that\nare important when measuring on mechanical systems with high accuracy and/or at\nvery low temperatures, such as thermal and quantum noise, linear response\ntheory, and backaction, are explained. From this, the quantum limit on linear\nposition detection is obtained and the sensitivities that have been achieved in\nrecent opto and nanoelectromechanical experiments are compared to this limit.\nThe mechanical resonators that are used in the experiments range from\nmeter-sized gravitational wave detectors to nanomechanical systems that can\nonly be read out using mesoscopic devices such as single-electron transistors\nor superconducting quantum interference devices. A special class of\nnanomechanical systems are bottom-up fabricated carbon-based devices, which\nhave very high frequencies and yet a large zero-point motion, making them ideal\nfor reaching the quantum regime.

We formalize this question by introducing a new framework for distributed\ncomputation, called {\\em oblivious protocols}.\n  We investigate the power of this model by considering two concrete examples,\nthe {\\em musical chairs} task $MC(n,m)$ and the well-known {\\em Renaming}\nproblem. The $MC(n,m)$ game is played by $n$ players (processors) with $m$\nchairs. Players can {\\em occupy} chairs, and the game terminates as soon as\neach player occupies a unique chair. Thus we say that player $P$ is {\\em in\nconflict} if some other player $Q$ is occupying the same chair, i.e.,\ntermination means there are no conflicts. By known results from distributed\ncomputing, if $m \\le 2n-2$, no strategy of the players can guarantee\ntermination. However, there is a protocol with $m = 2n-1$ chairs that always\nterminates. Here we consider an oblivious protocol where in every time step the\nonly communication is this: an adversarial {\\em scheduler} chooses an arbitrary\nnonempty set of players, and for each of them provides only one bit of\ninformation, specifying whether the player is currently in conflict or not. A\nplayer notified not to be in conflict halts and never changes its chair,\nwhereas a player notified to be in conflict changes its chair according to its\ndeterministic program. Remarkably, even with this minimal communication\ntermination can be guaranteed with only $m=2n-1$ chairs. Likewise, we obtain an\noblivious protocol for the Renaming problem whose name-space is small as that\nof the optimal nonoblivious distributed protocol.\n  Other aspects suggest themselves, such as the efficiency (program length) of\nour protocols.

An\nimportant observational constraint neglected in the analysis is the mass of\ndust giving rise to the IR emission. In this paper we add this constraint to\nthe analysis of AzTEC-3. Adopting an upper limit to the mass of stars and a\nbolometric luminosity for this object, we construct stellar and chemical\nevolutionary scenarios, constrained to produce the inferred dust mass and\nobserved luminosity before the associated stellar mass exceeds the\nobservational limit. We find that the model with a Top Heavy IMF provided the\nmost plausible scenario consistent with the observational constraints. In this\nscenario the dust formed over a period of ~200 Myr, with a SFR of ~500 Msun/yr.\nThese values for the age and SFR in AzTEC-3 are significantly higher and lower,\nrespectively, from those derived without the dust mass constraint. However,\nthis scenario is not unique, and others cannot be completely ruled out because\nof the prevailing uncertainties in the age of the galaxy, its bolometric\nluminosity, and its stellar and dust masses. A robust result of our models is\nthat all scenarios require most of the radiating dust mass to have been\naccreted in molecular clouds. Our new procedure highlights the importance of a\nmultiwavelength approach, and of the use of dust evolution models in\nconstraining the age and the star formation activity and history in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 15:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Consistent with experimental\nobservations we also find that the bending energy associated with the vertices\nof bilayer polyhedra can be locally reduced through the formation of pores.\nHowever, the stabilization of polyhedral bilayer vesicles over spherical\nbilayer vesicles relies crucially on molecular segregation of excess\namphiphiles along the ridges rather than the vertices of bilayer polyhedra.\nFurthermore, our analysis implies that, contrary to what has been suggested on\nthe basis of experiments, the icosahedron does not minimize elastic bending\nenergy among arbitrary polyhedral shapes and sizes. Instead, we find that, for\nlarge polyhedron sizes, the snub dodecahedron and the snub cube both have lower\ntotal bending energies than the icosahedron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 15:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-13"}

The molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio of\nthe star formation rate (SFR) to CO luminosity, is ~1 Gyr-1 for near-solar\nmetallicity galaxies with stellar masses above M_S~1e11 M_sun. In this regime\nthe depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as a\nfunction of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z~0 and 2. Below\nM_S the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. We argue\nthat this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physical\nparameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamental\nmetallicity-SFR-stellar mass relation. A more probable explanation is that the\nconversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in\n'CO-dark' gas.

Lastly, we consider experimentally\nrelevant regimes to observe the structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 15:55:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 21:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 16:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-02"}
