Yet,\nwhile they are well-founded in theory, independent verification and calibration\nof these models, including the exploration of possible degeneracies between\ntheir parameters, are rarely made. As a consequence, a robust fitting method\nthat leads to unique and reproducible results has been lacking. Here we\nintroduce a novel approach based on Bayesian analysis to fit the Spitzer-IRS\nspectra of starbursts using the SED models proposed by Groves et al. (2008). We\ndemonstrate its capabilities and verify the agreement between the derived best\nfit parameters and actual physical conditions by modelling the nearby,\nwell-studied, giant HII region 30 Dor in the LMC. The derived physical\nparameters, such as cluster mass, cluster age, ISM pressure and covering\nfraction of photodissociation regions, are representative of the 30 Dor region.\nThe inclusion of the emission lines in the modelling is crucial to break\ndegeneracies. We investigate the limitations and uncertainties by modelling\nsub-regions, which are dominated by single components, within 30 Dor. A\nremarkable result for 30 Doradus in particular is a considerable contribution\nto its mid-infrared spectrum from hot ({\\simeq} 300K) dust. The demonstrated\nsuccess of our approach will allow us to derive the physical conditions in more\ndistant, spatially unresolved starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 16:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

It automatically constructs a\nsequence of increasingly smaller matrix problems that enable efficient\nresolution of all scales present in the solution. One of the main components of\nthe method is an adequate choice of coarse grids. The current coarsening\nmethodology is based on measuring how a so-called algebraically smooth error\nvalue at one point depends on the error values at its neighbors. Such a concept\nof strength of connection is well understood for operators whose principal part\nis an M-matrix; however, the strength concept for more general matrices is not\nyet clearly understood, and this lack of knowledge limits the scope of AMG\napplicability. The purpose of this paper is to motivate a general definition of\nstrength of connection, based on the notion of algebraic distances, discuss its\nimplementation, and present the results of initial numerical experiments.

The diffusion process is\nsimulated using relativistic Fokker-Planck dynamics for elastic scattering in a\nhydrodynamic background. The heavy-quark transport coefficients in the medium\nare obtained from non-perturbative $T$-matrix interactions which build up\nresonant correlations close to the transition temperature. The latter also form\nthe basis for hadronization of heavy quarks into heavy-flavor mesons via\nrecombination with light quarks from the medium. The pertinent resonance\nrecombination satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping\nbetween quark and meson distributions. The recombination probability is derived\nfrom the resonant heavy-quark scattering rate. Consequently, recombination\ndominates at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and yields to fragmentation at\nhigh $p_T$.

We pursue the investigation\nof this discrepancy by computing model spectra of cool convective white dwarfs\nfrom a small sequence (11,300 K < Teff < 12,800 K) of 3D hydrodynamical model\natmospheres, which feature a sophisticated treatment of convection and\nradiative transfer.

We argue that even if the mechanism of moduli stabilization is\ndecoupled from the mechanism of SUSY breaking, moduli masses will generically\nbe parametrically related to the gravitino mass once the cancellation of the\ncosmological constant is taken into account. For low- scale SUSY breaking, this\nimplies that moduli fields are light, long-lived relics that will generically\ndrive the universe into a matter-dominated phase, in contradiction to standard\nBBN. We discuss two scenarios for evading this problem. The first is to\nconsider very tuned supergravity potentials that can make the moduli heavy\nenough to decay at early times and reheat above the temperature of BBN. Viable\ncosmology can be achieved in this scenario, which has a population of highly\nrelativistic light gravitinos arising from decays of moduli. Next, we consider\nthe more natural scenario with light moduli. The saxion field associated with\nthe solution of the strong CP problem provides the most natural candidate for\ndriving thermal inflation, which dilutes the moduli. We construct an explicit\nmodel for this scenario, when the PQ symmetry breaking scale is larger than the\nmessenger scale.

The huge\nvariety of morphologies requires an approach that is highly flexible, e.g.,\naccounting for azimuthal structure. We revisit the method of sersiclets, where\ngalaxy morphologies are decomposed into basis functions based on the Sersic\nprofile. This approach is justified by the fact that the Sersic profile is the\nfirst-order Taylor expansion of any real light profile. We show that sersiclets\novercome the modelling failures of shapelets. However, sersiclets implicate an\nunphysical relation between the steepness of the light profile and the spatial\nscale of azimuthal structures, which is not obeyed by real galaxy morphologies\nand can therefore give rise to modelling failures. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat sersiclets are prone to undersampling, which restricts sersiclet modelling\nto highly resolved galaxy images. Analysing data from the Great08 challenge, we\ndemonstrate that sersiclets should not be used in weak-lensing studies. We\nconclude that although the sersiclet approach appears very promising at first\nglance, it suffers from conceptual and practical problems that severly limit\nits usefulness. The Sersic profile can be enhanced by higher-order terms in the\nTaylor expansion, which can drastically improve model reconstructions of galaxy\nimages. If orthonormalised, these higher-order profiles can overcome the\nproblems of sersiclets while preserving their mathematical justification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Our algorithm has\nrunning time O($nm^\\prime$), where $m^\\prime$ is the number of edges in a\nminimal triangulation of the given graph. Generalized split graphs can\nrecognized via this algorithm in O($nm' + n\\OL{m}'$) = O($n^3$) time. We give\nalgorithms on unipolar graphs for finding a maximum independent set and a\nminimum clique cover in O($n+m$) time and for finding a maximum clique and a\nminimum proper coloring in O($n^{2.5}/\\log n$), when a unipolar partition is\ngiven. These algorithms yield algorithms for the four optimization problems on\ngeneralized split graphs that have the same worst-case time bound. We also\nprove that the perfect code problem is NP-Complete for unipolar graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 20:37:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 21:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

When images are\nquantified using pair correlation functions, the magnitude of apparent\nclustering due to over-counting will vary inversely with the surface density of\nlabeled molecules and does not depend on the number of times an average\nmolecule is counted.

We also note these\nsolutions remain coordinate free as no priori localization information of the\nnodes is assumed. For the coverage hole problem, we follow a \"divide and\nconquer approach\", by strategically dissecting the network so that the overall\ntopology is preserved, while efficiently pursuing the detection and\nlocalization of failures. The detection of holes, is enabled by first\nattributing a combinatorial object called a \"Rips Complex\" to each network\nsegment, and by subsequently checking the existence/non-existence of holes by\nway of triviality of the first homology class of this complex. Our estimate\nexponentially approaches the location of potential holes with each iteration,\nyielding a very fast convergence coupled with optimal usage of valuable\nresources such as power and memory. We then show a simple extension of the\nabove problem to address a well known problem in networks, namely the\nlocalization of a worm hole attack.

Here we present a new\nscenario for the formation of GCs, in an attempt to qualitatively explain this\notherwise intriguing observational framework. Our scenario divides GCs into\nthree groups, depending on the initial mass (M_I) of the progenitor structure\n(PS), as follows. i) Massive PSs can retain the gas ejected by massive stars,\nincluding the ejecta of core-collapse SNe. ii) Intermediate-mass PSs can retain\nat least a fraction of the fast winds of massive stars, but none of the\ncore-collapse SNe ejecta. iii) Low-mass PSs can only retain the slow winds of\nintermediate-mass stars. Members of the first group would include omega\nCentauri (NGC 5139), M54 (NGC 6715), M22 (NGC 6656), and Terzan 5, whereas NGC\n2808 (and possibly NGC 2419) would be members of the second group. The\nremaining GCs which only present a spread in light elements, such as O and Na,\nwould be members of the third group. According to our scenario, the different\ncomponents in omega Cen should not display a sizeable spread in age. We argue\nthat this is consistent with the available observations. We give other simple\narguments in favor of our scenario, which can be described in terms of two main\nanalytical relations: i) Between the actual observed ratio between first and\nsecond generation stars (R_SG^FG) and the fraction of first generation stars\nthat have been lost by the GC (S_L); and ii) Between S_L and M_I. We also\nsuggest a series of future improvements and empirical tests that may help\ndecide whether the proposed scenario properly describes the chemical evolution\nof GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 23:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Although their realistic effect on\npatient dose distributions would be generally small, it could be at the level\nof a few percent when a beam traverses a large bone. Conclusions: The present\nconversion functions are invariant and may be incorporated in treatment\nplanning systems with a common function relating CT number to electron density.\nThis will enable improved beam dose calculation while minimizing initial setup\nand quality management of the user's specific system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 01:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 08:37:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 07:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

We\nshow, by numerical simulations, that the electric \"cavity\" field inside a\nhydrated non-polar solute does not follow the predictions of standard Maxwell's\nelectrostatics of dielectrics. Instead, the field inside the solute tends, with\nincreasing solute size, to the limit predicted by the Lorentz virtual cavity.\nThe standard paradigm fails because of its reliance on the surface charge\ndensity at the dielectric interface determined by the boundary conditions of\nthe Maxwell dielectric. The interface of a polar liquid instead carries a\npreferential in-plane orientation of the surface dipoles thus producing\nvirtually no surface charge. The resulting boundary conditions for\nelectrostatic problems differ from the traditional recipes, affecting the\nmicroscopic and macroscopic fields based on them. We show that relatively small\ndifferences in cavity fields propagate into significant differences in the\ndielectric constant of an ideal mixture. The slope of the dielectric increment\nof the mixture versus the solute concentration depends strongly on which\npolarization scenario at the interface is realized.

A number of\nalternative measures have been proposed, but, with a few exceptions, these have\ngenerally been applied only to the online problem they were developed in\nconnection with. Recently, a systematic study of performance measures for\nonline algorithms was initiated [Boyar, Irani, Larsen: Eleventh International\nAlgorithms and Data Structures Symposium 2009], first focusing on a simple\nserver problem. We continue this work by studying a fundamentally different\nonline problem, online search, and the Reservation Price Policies in\nparticular. The purpose of this line of work is to learn more about the\napplicability of various performance measures in different situations and the\nproperties that the different measures emphasize. We investigate the following\nanalysis techniques: Competitive, Relative Worst Order, Bijective, Average,\nRelative Interval, Random Order, and Max/Max. In addition to drawing\nconclusions on this work, we also investigate the measures' sensitivity to\nintegral vs. real-valued domains, and as a part of this work, generalize some\nof the known performance measures.

This fact and\nimpossibility to observe entropy decrease at introspection explain the second\nlaw of thermodynamics. The situation in quantum mechanics is even a little bit\neasier: all closed systems of finite volume are periodic or nearly periodic.\nThe proof in quantum mechanics is in many respects similar to the proof in\nclassical Hamilton mechanics - it also uses small interaction between\nsubsystems and impossibility to observe entropy decrease at introspection.\nHowever, there are special cases which were not found in the classical\nmechanics.

First, the particle is driven by the rapid collisions with the\nsurrounding solvent molecules, referred to as thermal noise. Second, the\nfriction between the particle and the viscous solvent damps its motion.\nConventionally, the thermal force is assumed to be random and characterized by\na white noise spectrum. Friction is assumed to be given by the Stokes drag,\nimplying that motion is overdamped. However, as the particle receives momentum\nfrom the fluctuating fluid molecules, it also displaces the fluid in its\nimmediate vicinity. The entrained fluid acts back on the sphere and gives rise\nto long-range correlation. This hydrodynamic memory translates to thermal\nforces, which display a coloured noise spectrum. Even 100 years after Perrin's\npioneering experiments on Brownian motion, direct experimental observation of\nthis colour has remained elusive. Here, we measure the spectrum of thermal\nnoise by confining the Brownian fluctuations of a microsphere by a strong\noptical trap. We show that due to hydrodynamic correlations the power spectral\ndensity of the spheres positional fluctuations exhibits a resonant peak in\nstrong contrast to overdamped systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that peak\namplification can be achieved through parametric excitation. In analogy to\nMicrocantilever-based sensors our results demonstrate that the\nparticle-fluid-trap system can be considered as a nanomechanical resonator,\nwhere the intrinsic hydrodynamic backflow enhances resonance. Therefore,\ninstead of being a disturbance, details in thermal noise can be exploited for\nthe development of new types of sensors and particle-based assays for\nlab-on-a-chip applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 09:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 07:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-18"}

The SU's require secure data transmission at the\nphysical layer while the NU's are served with conventional best-effort data\ntraffic. The problem is formulated as joint power and subcarrier allocation\nwith the objective of maximizing average aggregate information rate of all NU's\nwhile maintaining an average secrecy rate for each individual SU under a total\ntransmit power constraint for the base station. We solve this problem in an\nasymptotically optimal manner using dual decomposition. Our analysis shows that\nan SU becomes a candidate competing for a subcarrier only if its channel gain\non this subcarrier is the largest among all and exceeds the second largest by a\ncertain threshold. Furthermore, while the power allocation for NU's follows the\nconventional water-filling principle, the power allocation for SU's depends on\nboth its own channel gain and the largest channel gain among others.

The non-perturbative equations we\npropose have no assumption about the proximity of the system to the epidemic\nthreshold, nor any linear approximation of the dynamics. In particular, we\nfirst develop a probabilistic description at the node level of the epidemic\npropagation for the so-called susceptible-infected-susceptible family of\nmodels, and after we derive the corresponding heterogeneous mean-field\napproach. We propose to use the full extension of the approach instead of\npruning the expansion to first order, which leads to a non-perturbative\nformulation that can be solved by fixed point iteration, and used with\nreliability far away from the epidemic threshold to assess the prevalence of\nthe epidemics.

Previous review articles in CS limit\ntheir scope to standard discrete-to-discrete measurement architectures using\nmatrices of randomized nature and signal models based on standard sparsity. In\nrecent years, CS has worked its way into several new application areas. This,\nin turn, necessitates a fresh look on many of the basics of CS. The random\nmatrix measurement operator must be replaced by more structured sensing\narchitectures that correspond to the characteristics of feasible acquisition\nhardware. The standard sparsity prior has to be extended to include a much\nricher class of signals and to encode broader data models, including\ncontinuous-time signals. In our overview, the theme is exploiting signal and\nmeasurement structure in compressive sensing. The prime focus is bridging\ntheory and practice; that is, to pinpoint the potential of structured CS\nstrategies to emerge from the math to the hardware.

These objects were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) to have estimated black hole (BH) masses below 2\\times10^6 M\\odot.\nCombining our results with previous ESI observations of similar objects, we\nobtain an expanded sample of 93 galaxies and examine the relation between BH\nmass and velocity dispersion (the M-Sigma relation) for active galaxies with\nlow BH masses. The low-mass active galaxies tend to follow the extrapolation of\nthe M-Sigma relation of inactive galaxies.

This result is consistent, within the uncertainties, with\nthe slope of the M-Sigma relation for reverberation-mapped active galaxies with\nBH masses from 10^6 to 10^9 M\\odot. For the subset of our sample having\nmorphological information from Hubble Space Telescope images, we examine the\nslope of the M-Sigma relation separately for subsamples of barred and unbarred\nhost galaxies, and find no significant evidence for a difference in slope. We\ndo find a mild offset between low-inclination and high-inclination disk\ngalaxies, such that more highly inclined galaxies tend to have larger {\\sigma}*\nat a given value of BH mass, presumably due to the contribution of disk\nrotation within the spectroscopic aperture. We also find that the velocity\ndispersion of the ionized gas trace the stellar velocity dispersion well for\nthis large sample of low-mass Seyfert 1 galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 14:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-05"}

We study the spot activity of II Peg during the years 2004-2010 to\ndetermine long- and short-term changes in the magnetic activity. In a previous\nstudy, we detected a persistent active longitude, as well as major changes in\nthe spot configuration occurring on a timescale of shorter than a year. The\nmain objective of this study is to determine whether the same phenomena persist\nin the star during these six years of spectroscopic monitoring.\n  Methods. The observations were collected with the high-resolution SOFIN\nspectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope. The temperature maps were\ncalculated using a Doppler imaging code based on Tikhonov regularization.\n  Results. We present 12 new temperature maps that show spots distributed\nmainly over high and intermediate latitudes. In each image, 1-3 main active\nregions can be identified. The activity level of the star is clearly lower than\nduring our previous study for the years 1994-2002. In contrast to the previous\nobservations, we detect no clear drift of the active regions with respect to\nthe rotation of the star.\n  Conclusions. Having shown a systematic longitudinal drift of the\nspot-generating mechanism during 1994-2002, the star has clearly switched to a\nlow-activity state for 2004-2010, during which the spot locations appear more\nrandom over phase space.

In this paper, we\nreview different methods to design or learn valid kernel functions for multiple\noutputs, paying particular attention to the connection between probabilistic\nand functional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 14:48:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 17:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}

In the\nabsence of the internetwork coupling ($J = 0$), the former network is well\nknown not to exhibit the synchronized phase at any finite coupling strength,\nwhereas the latter displays the mean-field transition. Through an analytic\napproach based on the mean-field approximation, it is found that for the weakly\ncoupled 1D network ($J_{\\rm I} \\ll 1$) the increase of $J$ suppresses\nsynchrony, because the nonsynchronized 1D network becomes a heavier burden for\nthe synchronization process of the WS network. As the coupling in the 1D\nnetwork becomes stronger, it is revealed by the renormalization group (RG)\nargument that the synchronization is enhanced as $J_{\\rm I}$ is increased,\nimplying that the more enhanced partial synchronization in the 1D network makes\nthe burden lighter. Extensive numerical simulations confirm these expected\nbehaviors, while exhibiting a reentrant behavior in the intermediate range of\n$J_{\\rm I}$. The nonmonotonic change of the critical value of $J_{\\rm II}$ is\nalso compared with the result from the numerical RG calculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 15:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches have\nbecome work horses in ABC. Here we discuss how to construct the perturbation\nkernels that are required in ABC SMC approaches, in order to construct a set of\ndistributions that start out from a suitably defined prior and converge towards\nthe unknown posterior. We derive optimality criteria for different kernels,\nwhich are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution and\nthe distribution of the perturbed particles. We will show that for many\ncomplicated posterior distributions, locally adapted kernels tend to show the\nbest performance. In cases where it is possible to estimate the Fisher\ninformation we can construct particularly efficient perturbation kernels. We\nfind that the added moderate cost of adapting kernel functions is easily\nregained in terms of the higher acceptance rate. We demonstrate the\ncomputational efficiency gains in a range of toy-examples which illustrate some\nof the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC, before turning to\ntwo demanding parameter inference problem in molecular biology, which highlight\nthe huge increases in efficiency that can be gained from choice of optimal\nmodels.

The large number of\nparameters as well as their nonlinear impact on the model responses hamper the\ndetermination of confidence regions for parameter estimates. At the same time,\nclassical approaches translating the uncertainty of the parameters into\nconfidence intervals for model predictions are hardly feasible.\n  In this article it is shown that a so-called prediction profile likelihood\nyields reliable confidence intervals for model predictions, despite arbitrarily\ncomplex and high-dimensional shapes of the confidence regions for the estimated\nparameters. Prediction confidence intervals of the dynamic states allow a\ndata-based observability analysis. The approach renders the issue of sampling a\nhigh-dimensional parameter space into evaluating one-dimensional prediction\nspaces. The method is also applicable if there are non-identifiable parameters\nyielding to some insufficiently specified model predictions that can be\ninterpreted as non-observability. Moreover, a validation profile likelihood is\nintroduced that should be applied when noisy validation experiments are to be\ninterpreted.\n  The properties and applicability of the prediction and validation profile\nlikelihood approaches are demonstrated by two examples, a small and instructive\nODE model describing two consecutive reactions, and a realistic ODE model for\nthe MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. The presented general approach\nconstitutes a concept for observability analysis and for generating reliable\nconfidence intervals of model predictions, not only, but especially suitable\nfor mathematical models of biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 19:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-14"}
