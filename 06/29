The absorption of electron-type\nneutrinos below the radius of the stalled shockwave may drive explosions (the\n\"neutrino mechanism\"). Because the heating rate is proportional to the square\nof neutrino energy, flavor conversion of mu and tau neutrinos to electron-type\nneutrinos via collective neutrino oscillations (CnuO) may in principle increase\nthe heating rate and drive explosions. In order to assess the potential\nimportance of CnuO for the shock revival, we solve the steady-state boundary\nvalue problem of spherically-symmetric accretion between the PNS surface (r_nu)\nand the shock (r_S), including a scheme for flavor conversion via CnuO. For a\ngiven r_nu, PNS mass (M), accretion rate (Mdot), and assumed values of the\nneutrino energies from the PNS, we calculate the critical neutrino luminosity\nabove which accretion is impossible and explosion results. We show that CnuO\ncan decrease the critical luminosity by a factor of at most ~1.5, but only if\nthe flavor conversion is fully completed inside r_S and if there is no matter\nsuppression. The magnitude of the effect depends on the model parameters (M,\nMdot, and r_nu) through the shock radius and the physical scale for flavor\nconversion. We quantify these dependencies and find that CnuO could lower the\ncritical luminosity only for small M and Mdot, and large r_nu. However, for\nthese parameter values CnuO are suppressed due to matter effects. By\nquantifying the importance of CnuO and matter suppression at the critical\nneutrino luminosity for explosion, we show in agreement with previous studies\nthat CnuO are unlikely to affect the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse\nsupernovae significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 16:21:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 16:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-29"}

Since continuous tracking\nof global network state at all nodes is practically impossible, nodes can only\nacquire limited local views of the whole network to design their transmission\nstrategies. In this paper, we study multi-layer wireless networks and assume\nthat each node has only a limited knowledge, namely 1-local view, where each\nS-D pair has enough information to perform optimally when other pairs do not\ninterfere, along with connectivity information for rest of the network. We\ninvestigate the information-theoretic limits of communication with such limited\nknowledge at the nodes. We develop a novel transmission strategy, namely Coded\nLayer Scheduling, that solely relies on 1-local view at the nodes and\nincorporates three different techniques: (1) per layer interference avoidance,\n(2) repetition coding to allow overhearing of the interference, and (3) network\ncoding to allow interference neutralization.

Orbits with arbitrary inclination to the stellar\nrotation axis are considered. We obtain results both from an analytic treatment\nand numerical one that are in satisfactory agreement. These results are applied\nto the initial phase of the tidal circularisation problem. We find that both\ntides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the\norbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6\nstellar radii (corresponding to periods $\\sim 4-5$ days after the\ncircularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger\nfor retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich\nlaw for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at\nthe age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by\ncircularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of\nthe planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital\nperiod $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.\nWe find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding\nto prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter\nmass and $P_{obs}\\sim $ four days. It grows with the mass of the planet, being\nof order five for a five Jupiter mass planet with the same $P_{orb}$. Thus, the\neffect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary\nsystems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a\nconsequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde\norbits. The results may also be applied to the problem of tidal capture of\nstars in young stellar clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 18:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We\ntake into account the dependence of collision frequency on the density and\ntemperature perturbations. The cooling-heating functions are taken for both\nelectrons and ions. A condensation mode of thermal instability has been studied\nin the fast sound speed limit. A new dispersion relation including the\ndifferent electron and ion cooling-heating functions and other effects\nmentioned above has been derived and its simple solutions for growth rates in\nthe limiting cases have been found. We have shown that the perturbations have\nan electromagnetic nature. The crucial role of the electric field perturbation\nalong the background magnetic field in the fast sound speed limit has been\ndemonstrated. We have found that at conditions under consideration, the\ncondensation must occur along the magnetic field while the transverse scale\nsizes can be both larger and smaller than the longitudinal ones. The results\nobtained can be useful for interpretation of observations of dense cold regions\nin astrophysical objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 19:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The 680 identified bona-fide PMS stars show a bimodal age distribution,\nwith two roughly equally numerous populations peaked respectively at ~1 Myr,\nand ~20 Myr. We use the age and other physical properties of these PMS stars to\nstudy how star formation has proceeded across time and space in NGC 346. We\nfind no correlation between the locations of young and old PMS stars, nor do we\nfind a correspondence between the positions of young PMS stars and those of\nmassive OB stars of similar age. Furthermore, the mass distribution of stars\nwith similar age shows large variations throughout the region. We conclude\nthat, while on a global scale it makes sense to talk about an initial mass\nfunction, this concept is not meaningful for individual star-forming regions.\nAn interesting implication of the separation between regions where massive\nstars and low-mass objects appear to form is that high-mass stars might not be\n\"perfect\" indicators of star formation and hence a large number of low-mass\nstars formed elsewhere might have so far remained unnoticed. For certain low\nsurface density galaxies this way of preferential low-mass star formation may\nbe the predominant mechanism, with the consequence that their total mass as\nderived from the luminosity may be severely underestimated and that their\nevolution is not correctly understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 19:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We take a sample of LRGs\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with redshifts of z>0.08 over a contiguous\narea of sky. Neighboring LRG magnitudes are averaged together to find the\nfluctuation in magnitudes as a function of R.A.. The result is a fluctuation of\na few percent in flux across roughly 100 degrees. The source of this\nfluctuation could be from a large scale bulk flow or a systematic in our\ntreatment of the data set, or the data set itself. A bulk flow model is fitted\nto the observed fluctuation, and the three bulk flow parameters, its direction\nand magnitude: alpha_b, delta_b, v_b are constrained. We find that the bulk\nflow direction is consistent with the direction found by other authors, with\nalpha_b 180, delta_b -50. The bulk flow magnitude however was found to be\nanomalously large with v_b>4000km/s. The LRG angular selection function cannot\nbe sufficiently taken into account in our analysis with the available data, and\nmay be the source of either the anomalous magnitude of the bulk flow signal, or\npossibly the entire fluctuation. However, the fluctuation indicates a bulk flow\ndirection very close to those found using other data sets and analyses. Further\ninvestigation with upcoming data is required to confirm this detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 20:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 19:56:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2012 22:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We evaluate the consequences of the lossy compression\nalgorithm of Bernstein et al. (2010) for the high-precision measurement of\nweak-lensing galaxy ellipticities. This square-root algorithm compresses each\npixel independently, and the information discarded is by construction less than\nthe Poisson error from photon shot noise. For simulated space-based images\n(without cosmic rays) digitized to the typical 16 bits per pixel, application\nof the lossy compression followed by image-wise lossless compression yields\nimages with only 2.4 bits per pixel, a factor of 6.7 compression. We\ndemonstrate that this compression introduces no bias in the sky background. The\ncompression introduces a small amount of additional digitization noise to the\nimages, and we demonstrate a corresponding small increase in ellipticity\nmeasurement noise. The ellipticity measurement method is biased by the addition\nof noise, so the additional digitization noise is expected to induce a\nmultiplicative bias on the galaxies' measured ellipticities. After correcting\nfor this known noise-induced bias, we find a residual multiplicative\nellipticity bias of m ~ -4x10^{-4}. This bias is small when compared to the\nmany other issues that precision weak lensing surveys must confront, and\nfurthermore we expect it to be reduced further with better calibration of\nellipticity measurement methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 21:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Inter-cell\ncoordination is in principle an effective way of ensuring different\ninfrastructure components behave in a way that increases, rather than\ndecreases, the key quality of service (QoS) metrics. The success of such\ncoordination depends heavily on how the overhead is shared, and the rate and\ndelay of the overhead sharing.

We refer to our new methodology as\nTransformation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC). One of the remarkable\nadvantages of our proposal is that even if the underlying target distribution\nis very high-dimensional, deterministic transformation of a one-dimensional\nrandom variable is sufficient to generate an appropriate Markov chain that is\nguaranteed to converge to the high-dimensional target distribution. Apart from\nclearly leading to massive computational savings, this idea of\ndeterministically transforming a single random variable very generally leads to\nexcellent acceptance rates, even though all the random variables associated\nwith the high-dimensional target distribution are updated in a single block.\nSince it is well-known that joint updating of many random variables using\nMetropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm generally leads to poor acceptance rates,\nTMCMC, in this regard, seems to provide a significant advance. We validate our\nproposal theoretically, establishing the convergence properties. Furthermore,\nwe show that TMCMC can be very effectively adopted for simulating from doubly\nintractable distributions.\n  TMCMC is compared with MH using the well-known Challenger data, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of of the former in the case of highly correlated variables.\nMoreover, we apply our methodology to a challenging posterior simulation\nproblem associated with the geostatistical model of Diggle et al. (1998),\nupdating 160 unknown parameters jointly, using a deterministic transformation\nof a one-dimensional random variable. Remarkable computational savings as well\nas good convergence properties and acceptance rates are the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 06:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 05:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 20:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-21"}

Extra mass ejection from the\nprimary star is one possible cause. (2) The expected He II 4687 brightness\nmaximum was followed several weeks later by another.

For multiset variables, where elements can be repeated, we consider\nricher representations that take into account additional information. We study\neight different representations in which we maintain bounds according to one of\nthe eight different orderings: length-(co)lex (LL/LC), variety-(co)lex (VL/VC),\nlength-variety-(co)lex (LVL/LVC), and variety-length-(co)lex (VLL/VLC)\norderings.

Therefore, our results are\nequally-applicable to any other localized objects on asymptotically\nPoincare-invariant space, such as classicalons. By adding a requirement that in\nlarge mass limit the quantization must approximately account for classical\nresults, we derive an universal quantization rule applicable to all\nclassicalons (including black holes) in arbitrary number of dimensions. In\nparticular, this implies, that black holes cannot emit/absorb arbitrarily soft\nquanta.

Clear variations are observed in\nthe spectra, most notably the ratio of the 11.0 to 11.2 micron bands, the peak\nposition of the 11.2 and 12.0 micron bands, and the degree of asymmetry of the\n11.2 micron band. The observed variations appear to change as a function of\nposition within the PDR. We aim to explain these variations by a change in the\nabundances of the emitting components of the PDR. A Blind Signal Separation\n(BSS) method, i.e. a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization algorithm is applied to\nseparate the observed spectrum into components. Using the NASA Ames PAH IR\nSpectroscopic Database, these extracted signals are fit. The observed signals\nalone were also fit using the database and these components are compared to the\nBSS components. Three component signals were extracted from the observation\nusing BSS. We attribute the three signals to ionized PAHs, neutral PAHs, and\nVery Small Grains (VSGs). The fit of the BSS extracted spectra with the PAH\ndatabase further confirms the attribution to ionized and neutral PAHs and\nprovides confidence in both methods for producing reliable results. The 11.0\nmicron feature is attributed to PAH cations while the 11.2 micron band is\nattributed to neutral PAHs. The VSG signal shows a characteristically\nasymmetric broad feature at 11.3 micron with an extended red wing.

Furthermore, we apply the\nCBR method to links rewiring procedure where at each step one link is removed\nand one new link is added. The CBR method helps to decide which links should be\nremoved or added. After several steps, the resulted networks are very close to\nthe optimal structure from the evolutionary optimization algorithm. The\nnumerical simulations on the Kuramoto model further demonstrate that our method\nhas advantage in shortening the convergence time to synchronization on directed\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 11:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

In these\nsolvated proteins, all having Tg and Td higher than the proteins hydrated by\nwater alone, the observation of the change of T-dependence of the MSD at Tg is\nunobstructed by the methyl-group rotation contribution at lower temperatures.\nOn the other hand, proteins hydrated by water alone have lower Tg and Td, and\nhence unambiguous evidence of the transition of MSD at Tg is hard to find.\nNotwithstanding, evidence on the break of the MSD at Tg can be found by\ndeuterating the protein to suppress the methyl-group contribution. An\nalternative strategy is the use of a spectrometer that senses motions faster\nthan 15 ps, which confers the benefit of shifting both the onset of\nmethyl-group rotation contribution as well as the dynamic transition to higher\ntemperatures, and again the change of MSD at Tg becomes evident. The break of\nthe elastic intensity or the MSD at Tg coexists with the dynamics transition at\nTd in hydrated and solvated proteins. Recognition of this fact helps to remove\ninconsistency and conundrum encountered in interpreting the data that thwart\nprogress in understanding the origin of the dynamic transition and its\nconnection to biological function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 12:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-30"}

We want to build more\ngeneral configurations of twisted, force-free magnetospheres as a first step to\nunderstanding the role played by the magnetic field geometry in the observed\nspectra. First we reviewed and extended previous analytical works to assess the\nviability and limitations of semi-analytical approaches.

We obtain new\nnumerical configurations of twisted magnetospheres, with distributions of twist\nand currents that differ from previous analytical solutions. The range of\nglobal twist of the new family of solutions is similar to the existing\nsemi-analytical models (up to some radians), but the achieved geometry may be\nquite different. The geometry of twisted, force-free magnetospheres shows a\nwider variety of possibilities than previously considered.

One context where this is\npossible is when the log density of the distribution of interest (the potential\nenergy function) can be written as the log of a Gaussian density, which is a\nquadratic function, plus a slowly varying function. Hamiltonian dynamics for\nquadratic energy functions can be analytically solved. With the splitting\ntechnique, only the slowly-varying part of the energy needs to be handled\nnumerically, and this can be done with a larger stepsize (and hence fewer\nsteps) than would be necessary with a direct simulation of the dynamics.\nAnother context where splitting helps is when the most important terms of the\npotential energy function and its gradient can be evaluated quickly, with only\na slowly-varying part requiring costly computations. With splitting, the quick\nportion can be handled with a small stepsize, while the costly portion uses a\nlarger stepsize. We show that both of these splitting approaches can reduce the\ncomputational cost of sampling from the posterior distribution for a logistic\nregression model, using either a Gaussian approximation centered on the\nposterior mode, or a Hamiltonian split into a term that depends on only a small\nnumber of critical cases, and another term that involves the larger number of\ncases whose influence on the posterior distribution is small.

The cluster core can then reach a central density high enough\nfor fast mergers of stellar-mass black holes and hence the rapid production of\na black hole seed that could be $10^5 M_\\odot$ or larger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 14:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2011 15:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

By quantifying physical parameters such as mass, velocity, and\norientation of the plasma ejection relative to the magnetic field, we provide a\ndescription of the nature of this particular phenomenon. The time-dependent\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) equations are solved in a box\nextending from the chromosphere to the lower corona. The plasma is heated by\ncurrents that are induced through field line braiding as a consequence of\nphotospheric motions. Spectra of optically thin emission lines in the extreme\nultraviolet range are synthesized, and magnetic field lines are traced over\ntime. Following strong heating just above the chromosphere, the pressure\nrapidly increases, leading to a hydrodynamic explosion above the upper\nchromosphere in the low transition region. The explosion drives the plasma,\nwhich needs to follow the magnetic field lines. The ejection is then moving\nmore or less ballistically along the loop-like field lines and eventually drops\ndown onto the surface of the Sun. The speed of the ejection is in the range of\nthe sound speed, well below the Alfven velocity. The plasma ejection is\nbasically a hydrodynamic phenomenon, whereas the rise of the heating rate is of\nmagnetic nature. The granular motions in the photosphere lead (by chance) to a\nstrong braiding of the magnetic field lines at the location of the explosion\nthat in turn is causing strong currents which are dissipated.

By using the\nsecond-order perturbation theory, we numerically show that the spectrum of the\ninduced gravitational waves has a plateau corresponding to duration of the\nenhancement and such gravitational waves can be probed by ultimate-DECIGO and\nspace-based atomic interferometers. We finally calculate the abundance of the\nprimordial black holes and put a constraint on the amplitude of the enhanced\ncurvature perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 15:57:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2011 08:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The kick source is considered as localized at the center of\nsquare with central symmetric spatial distribution. It is found that ensemble\naveraged energy of the particle diffusively grows as a function of time. This\ngrowth is much more extensive than that of kicked rotor energy. It is shown\nthat momentum transfer distribution in kicked billiard is considerably\ndifferent than that for kicked free particle. Time-dependence of the ensemble\naveraged energy for different localizations of the kick source is also\nexplored. It is found that changing of localization doesn't lead to crucial\nchanges in the time-dependence of the energy. Also, escape and transport of\nparticles are studied by considering kicked open billiard with one and three\nholes, respectively. It is found that for the open billiard with one hole the\nnumber of (non-interacting) billiard particles decreases according to\nexponential law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 02:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
