Both protocols are natural\nand intuitive to verify, and Bracha's achieves optimal resilience. However, the\nexpected running time of these protocols is exponential in general. Recently,\nKapron, Kempe, King, Saia, and Sanwalani presented the first efficient\nByzantine agreement algorithm in the asynchronous, full information model,\nrunning in polylogarithmic time. Their algorithm is Monte Carlo and drastically\ndeparts from the simple structure of Ben-Or and Bracha's Las Vegas algorithms.\n  In this paper, we begin an investigation of the question: to what extent is\nthis departure necessary? Might there be a much simpler and intuitive Las Vegas\nprotocol that runs in expected polynomial time? We will show that the\nexponential running time of Ben-Or and Bracha's algorithms is no mere accident\nof their specific details, but rather an unavoidable consequence of their\ngeneral symmetry and round structure. We define a natural class of \"fully\nsymmetric round protocols\" for solving Byzantine agreement in an asynchronous\nsetting and show that any such protocol can be forced to run in expected\nexponential time by an adversary in the full information model. We assume the\nadversary controls $t$ Byzantine processors for $t = cn$, where $c$ is an\narbitrary positive constant $< 1/3$. We view our result as a step toward\nidentifying the level of complexity required for a polynomial-time algorithm in\nthis setting, and also as a guide in the search for new efficient algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2011 20:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2011 01:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}

We explore the\nuse of the new BT2 (Barber et al. 2006) water line list in fitting the spectra,\nand we find that it does a much better job than the well-known HITRAN (Rothman\net al. 1998) water line list in the observed wavelength range and for the warm\ntemperatures probed by our data. By comparing the observed spectra with\nsynthetic disk emission models, we find that the water and OH emission lines\nhave similar widths (FWHM ~ 18 km s-1). If the line widths are set by disk\nrotation, the OH and water emission lines probe a similar range of disk radii\nin this source. The water and OH emission are consistent with thermal emission\nfor both components at a temperature ~ 1500 K. The column densities of the\nemitting water and OH are large, ~ 10^{21} cm-2 and ~ 10^{20} cm-2,\nrespectively.

As with the initial black string, each local string segment is\nitself unstable, and this fuels the self-similar cascade to (classically)\narbitrarily small scales; in the process the horizon develops a fractal\nstructure. In finite asymptotic time, the remaining string segments shrink to\nzero-size, yielding a naked singularity. Since no fine-tuning is required to\nexcite the instability, this constitutes a generic violation of cosmic\ncensorship.

We study the influence of two\nastrophysical processes, active galactic nuclei (AGN) heating and intracluster\nmedium (ICM) cooling, on the Lx-Tvir relation, simultaneously for the first\ntime. We determine best-fit relations for different subsamples using the\ncool-core strength and the presence of central radio activity as selection\ncriteria. We find the strong cool-core clusters (SCCs) with short cooling times\n(< 1Gyr)to display the steepest relation (Lx ~ Tvir^{3.33}) and the\nnon-cool-core clusters (NCCs) with long cooling times (> 7.7Gyr) to display the\nshallowest (Lx ~ Tvir^{2.42}). This has the simple implication that on the\nhigh-mass scale (Tvir > 2.5keV) the steepening of the Lx-Tvir relation is\nmainly due to the cooling of the intracluster medium gas. We propose that ICM\ncooling and AGN heating are both important in shaping the Lx-Tvir relation but\non different length-scales. While our study indicates that ICM cooling\ndominates on cluster scales (Tvir > 2.5keV), we speculate that AGN heating\ndominates the scaling relation in poor clusters and groups (Tvir < 2.5keV). The\nintrinsic scatter about the Lx-Tvir relation in X-ray luminosity for the whole\nsample is 45.4% and varies from a minimum of 34.8% for weak cool-core clusters\nto a maximum of 59.4% for clusters with no central radio source. We find that\nafter excising the cooling region, the scatter in the Lx-Tvir relation drops\nfrom 45.4% to 39.1%, implying that the cooling region contributes ~ 27% to the\noverall scatter. Lastly, we find the true SCC fraction to be 25% lower than the\nobserved one and the true normalizations of the Lx-Tvir relations to be lower\nby 12%, 7%, and 17% for SCC, WCC, and NCC clusters, respectively.

The model can be realized in terms of\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and photonic-crystal fibers. Following the\nrecent analysis of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of localized modes\ntrapped in 1D and 2D double-well nonlinear potentials (also known as\npseudopotentials), we aim to find 2D solitons in the two-circle setting, using\nnumerical methods and the variational approximation (VA). Well-separated\ncircles support stable symmetric and antisymmetric solitons. The decrease of\nseparation L between the circles leads to destabilization of the solitons. The\nsymmetric modes undergo two SSB transitions. First, they are transformed into\nweakly asymmetric breathers, which is followed by a transition to single-peak\nmodes trapped in one circle. The antisymmetric solitons perform a direct\ntransition to the single-peak mode. The symmetric solitons are described\nreasonably well by the VA. For touching (L=0) and overlapping (L<0) circles,\nsingle-peak solitons are found-asymmetric ones, trapped in either circle, and\nsymmetric solitons centered at the midpoint of the bi-circle configuration. If\nthe overlap is weak, the symmetric soliton is unstable. It may spontaneously\nleap into either circle and perform shuttle motion in it. A region of stability\nof the symmetric solitons appears with the increase of the overlap degree. In\nthe case of a moderately strong overlap, another SSB effect is found, in the\nform of a pair of symmetry-breaking and restoring bifurcations which link\nfamilies of the symmetric and asymmetric solitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2011 11:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We describe the influence on\ncurrent and in particular, the finite-frequency shotnoise. We illustrate these\nideas by studying transport through a quantum dot and give results that include\nboth sequential and cotunneling processes. Importantly, the noise spectra\nderived from the classical description are essentially frequency-independent\nand all quantum noise effects are absent.
