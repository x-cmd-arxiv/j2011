The tasks of\n\"programming\" global behaviors through local constraints belong to the area of\nsecurity. The \"program particles\" that assure that a system of local\ninteractions leads towards some desired global goals are called security\nprotocols. As computation spreads beyond cyberspace, into physical and social\nspaces, new security tasks and problems arise. As networks are extended by\nphysical sensors and controllers, including the humans, and interlaced with\nsocial networks, the engineering concepts and techniques of computer security\nblend with the social processes of security. These new connectors for\ncomputational and social software require a new \"discipline of programming\" of\nglobal behaviors through local constraints. Since the new discipline seems to\nbe emerging from a combination of established models of security protocols with\nolder methods of procedural programming, we use the name procedures for these\nnew connectors, that generalize protocols.

Its popularity is mainly due to its fast convergence speed, which is\nconsidered to be optimal in practice. In this paper, RLS methods are used to\nsolve reinforcement learning problems, where two new reinforcement learning\nalgorithms using linear value function approximators are proposed and analyzed.\nThe two algorithms are called RLS-TD(lambda) and Fast-AHC (Fast Adaptive\nHeuristic Critic), respectively. RLS-TD(lambda) can be viewed as the extension\nof RLS-TD(0) from lambda=0 to general lambda within interval [0,1], so it is a\nmulti-step temporal-difference (TD) learning algorithm using RLS methods. The\nconvergence with probability one and the limit of convergence of RLS-TD(lambda)\nare proved for ergodic Markov chains. Compared to the existing LS-TD(lambda)\nalgorithm, RLS-TD(lambda) has advantages in computation and is more suitable\nfor online learning. The effectiveness of RLS-TD(lambda) is analyzed and\nverified by learning prediction experiments of Markov chains with a wide range\nof parameter settings. The Fast-AHC algorithm is derived by applying the\nproposed RLS-TD(lambda) algorithm in the critic network of the adaptive\nheuristic critic method. Unlike conventional AHC algorithm, Fast-AHC makes use\nof RLS methods to improve the learning-prediction efficiency in the critic.\nLearning control experiments of the cart-pole balancing and the acrobot\nswing-up problems are conducted to compare the data efficiency of Fast-AHC with\nconventional AHC. From the experimental results, it is shown that the data\nefficiency of learning control can also be improved by using RLS methods in the\nlearning-prediction process of the critic. The performance of Fast-AHC is also\ncompared with that of the AHC method using LS-TD(lambda). Furthermore, it is\ndemonstrated in the experiments that different initial values of the variance\nmatrix in RLS-TD(lambda) are required to get better performance not only in\nlearning prediction but also in learning control. The experimental results are\nanalyzed based on the existing theoretical work on the transient phase of\nforgetting factor RLS methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 16:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-06"}

The channels are thought to be\nof larger diameter than believed before because, for an N-S-N system where the\nsuperconductor consists of an array of single-walled carbon nanotubes, the\nresistance, for good contacts, is R_Q/2N, where N is the number of nanotubes\nand R_Q=12.9 kOhm [See e.g. M.

To integrate these new data sources with enterprise\ndata, the current state-of-the-art approach is to convert the images to ASCII\ntext using optical character recognition (OCR) software and then to store the\nresulting ASCII text in a relational database. The OCR problem is challenging,\nand so the output of OCR often contains errors. In turn, queries on the output\nof OCR may fail to retrieve relevant answers. State-of-the-art OCR programs,\ne.g., the OCR powering Google Books, use a probabilistic model that captures\nmany alternatives during the OCR process. Only when the results of OCR are\nstored in the database, do these approaches discard the uncertainty. In this\nwork, we propose to retain the probabilistic models produced by OCR process in\na relational database management system. A key technical challenge is that the\nprobabilistic data produced by OCR software is very large (a single book blows\nup to 2GB from 400kB as ASCII). As a result, a baseline solution that\nintegrates these models with an RDBMS is over 1000x slower versus standard text\nprocessing for single table select-project queries. However, many applications\nmay have quality-performance needs that are in between these two extremes of\nASCII and the complete model output by the OCR software. Thus, we propose a\nnovel approximation scheme called Staccato that allows a user to trade recall\nfor query performance. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis of our\nscheme's properties, and describe how we integrate our scheme with\nstandard-RDBMS text indexing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 18:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 00:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 07:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 04:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-09"}

Previously,\nthe exploration of these fundamental results assumed long-term constraints, for\nexample, channel codes can have infinite decoding delay, and power or rate is\nnormalized over infinite channel-uses.

With these constraints, although the transmitter can\nperform rate adaption, power control, or beamforming, we show that\ndecoding-error is unavoidable.

Using realistic experimental capabilities for a wide range\nof targets (including fluorine, sodium, argon, germanium, iodine and xenon),\nthe role of target complementarity is analysed in detail while including the\nimpact of astrophysical uncertainties in a self-consistent manner.

Whereas the current Fermi-LAT data are not sensitive to any of\nthe CMSSM scenarios studied, and the calculated gamma-ray fluxes are probably\nunobservably low along the coannihilation strip for tanb = 10, we find that\nsubstantial portions of the focus-point strips and rapid-annihilation funnel\nregions could be pressured by several more years of Fermi-LAT data, if\nunderstanding of the astrophysical background and/or systematic uncertainties\ncan be improved in parallel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2011 21:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2011 16:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This feature requires a two--step process, in which the nuclearly\nprocessed matter from a first generation (FG) of stars gives birth to a second\ngeneration (SG) bearing the fingerprint of a fully CNO-cycled matter. Since the\npresent population of most globular clusters is made up largely of SG stars, a\nsubstantial fraction of the FG (>~90%) must be lost. Nevertheless, two types of\nclusters dominated by a simple stellar population (FG clusters) should exist:\neither clusters initially too small to be able to retain a cooling flow and\nform a SG (FG-only clusters), or massive clusters that could retain the CNO\nprocessed ejecta and form a SG, but were unable to lose a significant fraction\nof their FG (mainly-FG clusters). We attempt a classification of FG clusters,\nbased on the morphology of their horizontal branches (HBs), as displayed in\nphotomectric catalogues for 106 clusters. FG candidates are the clusters in\nwhich the HB can be reproduced by the evolution of an almost unique mass. <20%\nof clusters with [Fe/H]<-0.8 appear to be FG, but only ~10% probably had a mass\nsufficient to form at all an SG. This small percentage confirms on a wider\ndatabase that the SG is a dominant constituent of today's clusters, suggesting\nthat its formation is an ingredient necessary for the survival of globular\nclusters during their dynamical evolution in the Galactic tidal field. Pal3\nturns out to be a good example of FG-only cluster. HB simulations and space\ndistribution of its components, indicate that M 53 is a \"mainly-FG\" cluster.\nMainly-FG candidates may be also NGC5634, NGC5694 and NGC6101. In contrast, NGC\n2419 contains >30% of SG stars, and its present dynamical status bears less\ninformation on its formation process than the analysis of the chemical\nabundances of its stars and of its HB morphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2011 10:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry\ncorresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The\nfirst method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by\nillumination (ICPM - illumination characteristic points' method (PM)). The\nsecond method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents\nfrom epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM - outline tangent PM). These\ntwo methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because\npositions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and\ncorresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is\nlimited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We\nalso consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic PM)\nand CTPM (curve tangent PM), for searching epipolar geometry for images of\nsmooth bodies based on a set of level curves with constant illumination\nintensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on\nisophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines.\nThe CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve\nepipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves\nepipolar line. The standard method (SM) based on knowledge of pairs of the\nalmost exact correspondent points. The methods have been implemented and tested\nby SM on pairs of real images. Unfortunately, the last two methods give us only\na finite subset of solutions including \"good\" solution. Exception is \"epipoles\nin infinity\".

We find that\ngraphene adsorbs on the a-SiO$_2$ surface through van der Waals interactions.\nThe inhomogeneous topology of the a-SiO$_2$ clean surface promotes a total\ncharge density displacement on the adsorbed graphene sheet, giving rise to\nelectron-rich as well as hole-rich regions on the graphene. Such anisotropic\ndistribution of the charge density may contribute to the reduction of the\nelectronic mobility in G/a-SiO$_2$ systems. Furthermore, the adsorbed graphene\nsheet exhibits a net total charge density gain. In this case, the graphene\nsheet becomes n-type doped, however, with no formation of chemical bonds at the\ngraphene--SiO$_2$ interface. The electronic charge transfer from a-SiO$_2$ to\nthe graphene sheet occurs upon the formation of a partially occupied level\nlying above the Dirac point.

This paper investigates optimal real-time spectrum\nsharing between a cooperative relay network (CRN) and a nearby ad-hoc network.\nSpecifically, we optimize the spectrum access and resource allocation\nstrategies of the CRN so that the average traffic collision time between the\ntwo networks can be minimized while maintaining a required throughput for the\nCRN. The development is first for a frame-level setting, and then is extended\nto an ergodic setting. For the latter setting, we propose an appealing optimal\nreal-time spectrum sharing strategy via Lagrangian dual optimization. The\nproposed method only involves a small amount of real-time computation and\nnegligible control delay, and thus is suitable for practical implementations.\nSimulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2011 15:04:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 05:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2012 03:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 21:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 03:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2013 18:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

These equations have elegant analytical solutions that replace the\ncomplex integro-differential motion equations by simple differential equations\nof pole motion in a complex plane. The main problem with such a solution is the\nexistence of finite time singularities. To prevent such singularities, nonzero\nsurface tension is usually used.However, nonzero surface tension does not exist\nin filtration combustion, and this destroys the analytical solutions. However,\na more elegant approach exists for solving the problem. First, we can introduce\na small amount of pole noise to the system. Second, for regularisation of the\nproblem, we throw out all new poles that can produce a finite time singularity.\nIt can be strictly proved that the asymptotic solution for such a system is a\nsingle finger. Moreover, the qualitative consideration demonstrates that a\nfinger with 1/2 of the channel width is statistically stable. Therefore, all\nproperties of such a solution are exactly the same as those of the solution\nwith nonzero surface tension under numerical noise.

We solve the master equation of\nthe system for increasing number of emitters and as a function of the cavity\nquality factor, and we identify three main regimes characterized by well\ndistinguished statistical properties of the emitted radiation. For small cavity\ndecay rate, the emission events are uncorrelated and the number of photons in\nthe emitted field becomes larger than one, resembling the build-up of a laser\nfield inside the cavity. At intermediate decay rates (as compared to the\nemitter-cavity coupling) and for few emitters, the statistics of the emitted\nradiation is bunched and strikingly dependent on the parity of the number of\nemitters. The latter property is related to the cooperativity of the emitters\nmediated by their coupling to the cavity mode, and its connection with steady\nstate subradiance is discussed. Finally, in the bad cavity regime the typical\nsituation of emission from a collection of individual emitters is recovered. We\nalso analyze how the cooperative behavior evolves as a function of pure\ndephasing, which allows to recover the case of a classical source made of an\nensemble of independent emitters, similar to what is obtained for a very leaky\ncavity. State-of-art techniques of Q-switch of resonant cavities, allied with\nthe recent capability to tune single emitters in and out of resonance, suggest\nthis system as a versatile source of different quantum states of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2011 15:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}
