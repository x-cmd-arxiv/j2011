We also\nanalyze some problems that may appear in connection with these mathematical\ntools and the Darwin-Fowler approach in this case. We show that, analogously to\nthe nuclear densities, the strengths for transitions that change the exciton\nnumber by two or leave it unchanged can be estimated microscopically as\nconvolutions of the functions of simpler states. When using the HO basis for\nthe Model Space we obtained important departure from the results of the exciton\nmodel (EXM), which can partially invalidate our previous analysis on the\nattainment of equilibrium during the PE stage. On the other hand, by using\nconstant grid of energies for the sp-basis we were able to reproduce the\nresults of EXM quite well in a large range of excitation energies. A new model\ncode, TRANSNU, was developed that can be ported to traditional semi-classical\ncodes like TNG for nuclear data evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 18:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2011 18:21:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 21:13:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 10:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-24"}

We use 100um and 160um fluxes from GOODS-Herschel\n-the deepest survey yet undertaken by the Herschel telescope- and show that in\n>94 per cent of cases these fluxes are dominated by the host. We find no\nevidence of any correlation between the X-ray and infrared luminosities of\nmoderate AGNs at any redshift, suggesting that star-formation is decoupled from\nnuclear (AGN) activity. The star formation rates of AGN hosts increase strongly\nwith redshift; by a factor of 43 from z<0.1 to z=2-3 for AGNs with the same\nX-ray luminosities. This increase is consistent with the factor of 25-50\nincrease in the specific star formation rates (SSFRs) of normal, star-forming\n(main-sequence) galaxies. Indeed, the average SSFRs of AGN hosts are only\nmarginally (20 per cent) lower than those of main-sequence galaxies, with this\nsmall deficit being due to a fraction of AGNs residing in quiescent (low-SSFR)\ngalaxies. We estimate 79+/-10 per cent of moderate AGNs are hosted in\nmain-sequence galaxies, 15+/-7 per cent in quiescent galaxies and <10 per cent\nin strongly starbursting galaxies. The fractions of all main sequence galaxies\nat z<2 experiencing a period of moderate nuclear activity is strongly dependent\non galaxy stellar mass (Mstars); rising from a few per cent at\nMstars~10^{10}Msun to >20 per cent at Mstars>10^{11}Msun.

This moral is given an explicit demonstration by giving\nthe correspondence between the coordinates on phase space for a field theory\nand the particle number. Usually the ambiguity in particle definitions is only\nas varied as the possible sets of observers on the spacetime. However, there is\na greater choice in coordinates on the phase space, especially for a field\nsystem with infinite degrees of freedom. Hence, for one set of coordinates on\nthe spacetime (one class of comoving observers) there are many different\ncoordinates to choose on the phase space. This demonstrates the true\nvacuousness of the concept of particles when defined as energy levels of the\nharmonic oscillator. In order to give a definition of particles we must specify\nthe apparatus that detects them. The Unruh-Dewitt detector is one such\napparatus, so we are not surprised to find that it gives a physically\nmeaningful definition of particles. We give an explicit example on de Sitter\nspacetime and explain how the definition of particles as energy levels of the\nharmonic oscillator is meaningless even in simple cases. This is done first by\ncomparing the response of an Unruh-Dewitt detector to the expectation of the\nnumber operator. Second, we demonstrate that by a choice of coordinates on\nphase space one can turn the Hamiltonian of a free Klein-Gordon field on FRW\nwith flat spatial sections into a set of harmonic oscillators with\ntime-independent mass and frequency. Also, we demonstrate a new method for\ndetermining the wave functional of known states such as the conformal vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 19:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 14:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-24"}

In this study, we approach the problem of parameter estimation in\nconductance-based models of single neurons from a different perspective. By\nadopting a hidden-dynamical-systems formalism, we expressed parameter\nestimation as an inference problem in these systems, which can then be tackled\nusing well-established statistical inference methods. The particular method we\nused was Kitagawa's self-organizing state-space model, which was applied on a\nnumber of Hodgkin-Huxley models using simulated or actual electrophysiological\ndata. We showed that the algorithm can be used to estimate a large number of\nparameters, including maximal conductances, reversal potentials, kinetics of\nionic currents and measurement noise, based on low-dimensional experimental\ndata and sufficiently informative priors in the form of pre-defined constraints\nimposed on model parameters. The algorithm remained operational even when very\nnoisy experimental data were used. Importantly, by combining the\nself-organizing state-space model with an adaptive sampling algorithm akin to\nthe Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy we achieved a significant\nreduction in the variance of parameter estimates. The algorithm did not require\nthe explicit formulation of a cost function and it was straightforward to apply\non compartmental models and multiple data sets. Overall, the proposed\nmethodology is particularly suitable for resolving high-dimensional inference\nproblems based on noisy electrophysiological data and, therefore, a potentially\nuseful tool in the construction of biophysical neuron models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 20:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2011 23:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-05"}

While this bound\nis extremely useful in practice, often real world signals are not only sparse,\nbut also exhibit structure in the sparsity pattern. We focus on\ngroup-structured patterns in this paper. Under this model, groups of signal\ncoefficients are active (or inactive) together. The groups are predefined, but\nthe particular set of groups that are active (i.e., in the signal support) must\nbe learned from measurements.

We adopt two\nrepresentative models for the bulge formation and thereby investigate whether\nthe two models can explain both the observed cylindrical rotation and vertical\nmetallicity gradient in a self-consistent manner. One is the \"pure disk\nscenario\" (PDS) in which the bulge is formed from a pure thin stellar disk\nthrough spontaneous bar instability. The other is the \"two-component disk\nscenario\" (TCDS) in which the bulge is formed from a disk composed of thin and\nthick disks through bar instability. Our numerical simulations show that\nalthough PDS can reproduce the cylindrical rotation, it shows a rather flatter\nvertical metallicity gradient that is inconsistent with observations. The\nderived flatter metallicity gradient is due to the vertical mixing of stars\nwith different initial metallicities by the stellar bar. This result implies\nthat the bulge can not be simply formed from a pure thin stellar disk. On the\nother hand, the bulge formed from the two-component disk in TCDS can explain\nboth the observed cylindrical rotation and vertical metallicity gradient of the\nGalactic bulge reasonably well. In TCDS, more metal-poor stars at higher |z|\n(vertical distance) which originate from the already dynamically hotter thick\ndisk can not be strongly influenced by vertical mixing of the bar so that they\ncan stay in situ for longer timescales and thus keep the lower metallicity at\nhigher |z|. Consequently, the vertical metallicity gradient of the bulge\ncomposed of initially thin and thick disk stars can not be so flattened, even\nif the gradient of the thin disk can be flattened significantly by the bar in\nTCDS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 03:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The stability\nof the 'pinball' phase occurring for strong Coulomb repulsions is found to be\nstrongly influenced by geometrical frustration. A comparison with a spinless\nmodel reproduces the transition from the homogeneous metallic phase to a\npinball liquid, which indicates that the spin correlations should play a much\nsmaller role than the charge correlations in the metallic phase close to the\ncharge ordering transition.

Accurate starlight subtraction is achieved by referring\nto all-sky star catalogs and a Galactic stellar population synthesis model down\nto 32.0 mag.

Two steepest descent preconditioning\nvariants are proposed. The first employs a line search, while the second\nemploys a predefined small step. A simple global convergence proof is provided\nfor the N-GMRES optimization algorithm with the first steepest descent\npreconditioner (with line search), under mild standard conditions on the\nobjective function and the line search processes. Steepest descent\npreconditioning for N-GMRES optimization is also motivated by relating it to\nstandard non-preconditioned GMRES for linear systems in the case of a quadratic\noptimization problem with symmetric positive definite operator. Numerical tests\non a variety of model problems show that the N-GMRES optimization algorithm is\nable to very significantly accelerate convergence of stand-alone steepest\ndescent optimization. Moreover, performance of steepest-descent preconditioned\nN-GMRES is shown to be competitive with standard nonlinear conjugate gradient\nand limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno methods for the model\nproblems considered.

The challenge with the\nStudent-t model is the analytically intractable inference which is why several\napproximative methods have been proposed. The expectation propagation (EP) has\nbeen found to be a very accurate method in many empirical studies but the\nconvergence of the EP is known to be problematic with models containing\nnon-log-concave site functions such as the Student-t distribution. In this\npaper we illustrate the situations where the standard EP fails to converge and\nreview different modifications and alternative algorithms for improving the\nconvergence. We demonstrate that convergence problems may occur during the\ntype-II maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the hyperparameters and show\nthat the standard EP may not converge in the MAP values in some difficult\ncases. We present a robust implementation which relies primarily on parallel EP\nupdates and utilizes a moment-matching-based double-loop algorithm with\nadaptively selected step size in difficult cases. The predictive performance of\nthe EP is compared to the Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte\nCarlo approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 12:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-28"}

We\nsuggest that the discrepant results occur primarily because most of previous\nstudies have not simultaneously investigated the X-ray to near-IR spectral\nenergy distribution of this GRB. The difficulty with this burst is that the\nX-ray afterglow is dominated by strong flares at early times and is poorly\nmonitored at late times. In addition, the Z band photometry, which is the most\nsensitive to dust extinction, has been found to be affected by strong\nsystematics. In this paper we carefully re-analyze the Swift/XRT afterglow\nobservations of this GRB, using extensive past studies of X-ray flare\nproperties when computing the X-ray afterglow flux level and exploiting the\nrecent reanalysis of the optical (UV rest frame) data of the same GRB. We\nextract the X-ray to optical/near-IR afterglow SED for the three epochs where\nthe best spectral coverage is available: 0.47, 1.25, and 3.4 days after the\ntrigger. A spectral power-law model has been fitted to the extracted SEDs. We\ndiscuss that no spectral breaks or chromatic temporal breaks are expected in\nthe epochs of interest. To fit any UV rest-frame dust absorption, we tested the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve, the mean extinction curve (MEC)\nfound for a sample of QSO at $z>4$ and its corresponding attenuation curve, as\nwell as a starburst attenuation curve, and the extinction curve consistent with\na supernova dust origin (SN-type).

In this paper we consider the\nstochastic properties of a biochemical circuit, known to control eukaryotic\ncell cycle and possibly involved in oncogenesis, recently proposed in the\nliterature within a deterministic framework. Due to the inherent stochasticity\nof biochemical processes and the small number of molecules involved, the\nstochastic approach should be more correct in describing the real system: we\nstudy the agreement between the two approaches by exploring the system\nparameter space. We address the problem by proposing a simplified version of\nthe model that allows analytical treatment, and by performing numerical\nsimulations for the full model. We observed optimal agreement between the\nstochastic and the deterministic description of the circuit in a large range of\nparameters, but some substantial differences arise in at least two cases: 1)\nwhen the deterministic system is in the proximity of a transition from a\nmonostable to a bistable configuration, and 2) when bistability (in the\ndeterministic system) is \"masked\" in the stochastic system by the distribution\ntails.

The lithium was introduced in the form\nof an aqueous LiCl micro-emulsion with a di-isopropylnaphthalene-based liquid\nscintillator. A Li-6 concentration of 0.15 % by weight was obtained. A 125 mL\nglass cell was filled with the scintillator and irradiated with fission-source\nneutrons. Fast neutrons may produce recoil protons in the scintillator, and\nthose neutrons that thermalize within the detector volume can be captured on\nthe Li-6. The energy of the neutron may be determined by the light output from\nrecoiling protons, and the capture of the delayed thermal neutron reduces\nbackground events. In this paper, we discuss the development of this 6Li-loaded\nliquid scintillator, demonstrate the operation of it in a detector, and compare\nits efficiency and capture lifetime with Monte Carlo simulations. Data from a\nboron-loaded plastic scintillator were acquired for comparison. We also present\na pulse-shape discrimination method for differentiating between electronic and\nnuclear recoil events based on the Matusita distance between a normalized\nobserved waveform and nuclear and electronic recoil template waveforms. The\ndetails of the measurements are discussed along with specifics of the data\nanalysis and its comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 14:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In particular, we consider two different cases:\nwhen g has zeros of a polynomial order and when g has zeros of an exponential\norder. These two cases correspond to moderate and severe data losses,\nrespectively. We obtain asymptotic minimax lower bounds for the global risk of\nan estimator of f and construct adaptive wavelet nonlinear thresholding\nestimators of f which attain those minimax convergence rates (up to a\nlogarithmic factor in the case of a zero of a polynomial order), over a wide\nrange of Besov balls.\n  The spatially inhomogeneous ill-posed problem that we investigate is\ninherently more difficult than spatially homogeneous problems like, e.g.,\ndeconvolution. In particular, due to spatial irregularity, assessment of\nminimax global convergence rates is a much harder task than the derivation of\nminimax local convergence rates studied recently in the literature.\nFurthermore, the resulting estimators exhibit very different behavior and\nminimax global convergence rates in comparison with the solution of spatially\nhomogeneous ill-posed problems. For example, unlike in deconvolution problem,\nthe minimax global convergence rates are greatly influenced not only by the\nextent of data loss but also by the degree of spatial homogeneity of f.\nSpecifically, even if 1/g is not integrable, one can recover f as well as in\nthe case of an equispaced design (in terms of minimax global convergence rates)\nwhen it is homogeneous enough since the estimator is \"borrowing strength\" in\nthe areas where f is adequately sampled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 14:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 14:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 22:21:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 17:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-29"}

The effect of variable initial rotational and magnetic\nenergies on the formation of massive stars is studied in detail. We focus on\naccretion rates and on the question under which conditions massive Keplerian\ndisks can form in the very early evolutionary stage of massive protostars. For\nthis purpose, we perform 12 simulations with different initial conditions\nextending over a wide range in parameter space. The equations of\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are solved under the assumption of ideal MHD. We\nfind that the formation of Keplerian disks in the very early stages is\nsuppressed for a mass-to-flux ratio normalised to the critical value \\mu below\n10, in agreement with a series of low-mass star formation simulations. This is\ncaused by very efficient magnetic braking resulting in a nearly instantaneous\nremoval of angular momentum from the disk. For weak magnetic fields,\ncorresponding to \\mu > 10, large-scale, centrifugally supported disks build up\nwith radii exceeding 100 AU. A stability analysis reveals that the disks are\nsupported against gravitationally induced perturbations by the magnetic field\nand tend to form single stars rather than multiple objects. We find\nprotostellar accretion rates of the order of a few 10^-4 M_\\sun yr^-1 which,\nconsidering the large range covered by the initial conditions, vary only by a\nfactor of ~ 3 between the different simulations. We attribute this fact to two\ncompeting effects of magnetic fields. On the one hand, magnetic braking\nenhances accretion by removing angular momentum from the disk thus lowering the\ncentrifugal support against gravity. On the other hand, the combined effect of\nmagnetic pressure and magnetic tension counteracts gravity by exerting an\noutward directed force on the gas in the disk thus reducing the accretion onto\nthe protostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 15:50:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 15:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

It has been discussed so far for small systems with only a few\nindependent parameters. We extend here to a much broader class of states when\nthe second party is of arbitrary dimension d, so long as the first, measured,\nparty is a qubit. We present two formulae to calculate quantum discord, the\nfirst relating to the original entropic definition and the second to a recently\nproposed geometric distance measure which leads to an analytical formulation.\nThe tracing over the qubit in the entropic calculation is reduced to a very\nsimple prescription. And, when the d-dimensional system is a so-called X state,\nthe density matrix having non-zero elements only along the diagonal and\nanti-diagonal so as to appear visually like the letter X, the entropic\ncalculation can be carried out analytically. Such states of the full bipartite\nqubit-qudit system may be named \"extended X states\", whose density matrix is\nbuilt of four block matrices, each visually appearing as an X. The optimization\ninvolved in the entropic calculation is generally over two parameters, reducing\nto one for many cases, and avoided altogether for an overwhelmingly large set\nof density matrices as our numerical investigations demonstrate. Our results\nalso apply to states of a N-qubit system, where \"extended X states\" consist of\n(2^(N+2) - 1) states, larger in number than the (2^(N+1) - 1) of X states of N\nqubits. While these are still smaller than the total number (2^(2N) - 1) of\nstates of N qubits, the number of parameters involved is nevertheless large. In\nthe case of N = 2, they encompass the entire 15-dimensional parameter space,\nthat is, the extended X states for N = 2 represent the full qubit-qubit system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 15:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-26"}
