The concentration of AMH in blood may also reflect the non-growing\nfollicle (NGF) population, i.e. the ovarian reserve, and be of value in\npredicting reproductive lifespan. A full description of AMH production up to\nthe menopause has not been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: By\nsearching the published literature for AMH concentrations in healthy\npre-menopausal females, and using our own data (combined n = 3,260) we have\ngenerated and robustly validated the first model of AMH concentration from\nconception to menopause. This model shows that 34% of the variation in AMH is\ndue to age alone. We have shown that AMH peaks at age 24.5 years, followed by a\ndecline to the menopause. We have also shown that there is a neonatal peak and\na potential pre-pubertal peak. Our model allows us to generate normative data\nat all ages. Conclusions/Significance: These data highlight key inflection\npoints in ovarian follicle dynamics. This first validated model of circulating\nAMH in healthy females describes a transition period in early adulthood, after\nwhich AMH reflects the progressive loss of the NGF pool. The existence of a\nneonatal increase in gonadal activity is confirmed for females. An improved\nunderstanding of the relationship between circulating AMH and age will lead\nmore accurate assessment of ovarian reserve for the individual woman.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 16:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-08"}

The objective of this study is to model the\nage-related population of NGFs in the human ovary from conception to menopause.\nData were taken from eight separate quantitative histological studies (n = 325)\nin which NGF populations at known ages from seven weeks post conception to 51\nyears (median 32 years) were calculated. The data set was fitted to 20 peak\nfunction models, with the results ranked by obtained r2 correlation\ncoefficient. The highest ranked model was chosen. Our model matches the\nlog-adjusted NGF population from conception to menopause to a five-parameter\nasymmetric double Gaussian cumulative (ADC) curve (r2 = 0.81). When restricted\nto ages up to 25 years, the ADC curve has r2 = 0.95. We estimate that for 95%\nof women by the age of 30 years only 12% of their maximum pre-birth NGF\npopulation is present and by the age of 40 years only 3% remains. Furthermore,\nwe found that the rate of NGF recruitment towards maturation for most women\nincreases from birth until approximately age 14 years then decreases towards\nthe menopause. To our knowledge, this is the first model of ovarian reserve\nfrom conception to menopause. This model allows us to estimate the number of\nNGFs present in the ovary at any given age, suggests that 81% of the variance\nin NGF populations is due to age alone, and shows for the first time, to our\nknowledge, that the rate of NGF recruitment increases from birth to age 14\nyears then declines with age until menopause. An increased understanding of the\ndynamics of human ovarian reserve will provide a more scientfic basis for\nfertility counselling for both healthy women and those who have survived\ngonadotoxic cancer treatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 16:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-08"}

Real-time retail pricing is characterized by\npassing on the real-time wholesale electricity prices to the end consumers, and\nis shown to create a closed-loop feedback system between the physical layer and\nthe market layer of the power system. In the absence of a carefully designed\ncontrol law, such direct feedback between the two layers could increase\nvolatility and lower the system's robustness to uncertainty in demand and\ngeneration. A new notion of generalized price-elasticity is introduced, and it\nis shown that price volatility can be characterized in terms of the system's\nmaximal relative price elasticity, defined as the maximal ratio of the\ngeneralized price-elasticity of consumers to that of the producers. As this\nratio increases, the system becomes more volatile, and eventually, unstable. As\nnew demand response technologies and distributed storage increase the\nprice-elasticity of demand, the architecture under examination is likely to\nlead to increased volatility and possibly instability. This highlights the need\nfor assessing architecture systematically and in advance, in order to optimally\nstrike the trade-offs between volatility, economic efficiency, and system\nreliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 17:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-08"}

Motivated by data\nwhich suggests that the strong coupling \\alpha_s(Q) freezes at low Q, and by\nsimilarities between the spectra of hadrons and atoms, I discuss if and how QCD\nbound states may be treated perturbatively. I recall the basic principles of\nperturbative gauge theory bound states at lowest order in the \\hbar expansion.\nBorn level amplitudes are insensitive to the i\\epsilon prescription of\npropagators, which allows to eliminate the Z-diagrams of relativistic,\ntime-ordered Coulomb interactions. The Dirac wave function thus describes a\nsingle electron which propagates forward in time only, even though the bound\nstate has any number of pair constituents when Feynman propagators are used. In\nthe absence of an external potential, states that are bound by the Coulomb\nattraction of their constituents can be analogously described using only their\nvalence degrees of freedom. The instantaneous A^0 field is determined by Gauss'\nlaw for each wave function component, i.e., for each position of the valence\nconstituents. Solutions for A^0 obtained with a boundary condition that imposes\nan asymptotically constant energy density give rise to a linear potential for\ncolor singlet q\\bar q and qqq states. The strength of the linear potential is\ndetermined by the boundary condition and is of lower order in \\alpha_s than the\ngluon exchange interaction, which may then be treated as a higher order\nperturbative correction. Bound states evaluated to a given order in \\alpha_s\nand \\hbar must have the full symmetry of the exact theory, including the\ndynamic boost invariance of states quantized at equal time. The wave functions\nare indeed found to have such a hidden invariance, which ensures the correct\ndependence of the energy eigenvalues on the center of mass momentum. Thus\nrelativistic bound states can be studied using perturbative methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 19:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-08"}

Unfortunately, it\nsuffers from the well-known mass-sheet degeneracy, so that weak lensing\nanalyses cannot lead to fully reliable determinations of the total mass of the\nclusters. One possible way to set the relevant scale of the density profile\nwould be to make a direct measurement of the magnification produced by the\nclusters as gravitational lenses. In this paper we revisit a suggestion made a\nfew years ago for this general purpose, based on the use of the Fundamental\nPlane as a standard rod for early-type galaxies. Here we move one step further,\nbeyond the simple outline of the idea given earlier, and quantify some\nstatistical properties of this innovative diagnostic tool, with the final goal\nof identifying clear guidelines for a future observational test on concrete\ncases, which turns out to be well within the current instrument capabilities.\nThe study is carried out by discussing the statistical properties of\nFundamental Plane measurements for a sample of early-type source galaxies\nbehind a massive cluster, for which a weak lensing analysis is assumed to be\navailable. We proceed to study the best strategy to use Fundamental Plane\nmeasurements to determine the mass scale of a given cluster and find that the\noptimal choice is that of a sample of early-type galaxies behind the cluster\ndistributed approximately uniformly in the sky.

We use a well-defined\nFokker-Planck equation for the phase space distribution of the charged impurity\nparticles in a weakly to moderately coupled plasma.

A generic prediction of these 'disk-locking' (DL) theories is that a\ndisk-locked star will be forced to co-rotate with the Keplerian angular\nvelocity of the inner edge of the disk. These theories have also been\ninterpreted to suggest a correlation between young stars' rotation periods and\nthe structural properties of their disks, such that slowly rotating stars\npossess close-in disks that enforce the star's slow rotation, whereas rapidly\nrotating stars possess anemic or evacuated inner disks that are unable to brake\nthe stars and they spin up as they contract. To test these expectations, we\nmodel the SEDs of 33 young stars in IC 348 with known rotation periods and\ninfrared excesses indicating the presence of disks. For each star, we match the\nobserved spectral energy distribution, typically sampling 0.6-8.0 \\mum, to a\ngrid of 200,000 pre-computed star+disk radiative transfer models, from which we\ninfer the disk's inner-truncation radius (R_trunc). We then compare this\nR_trunc to the disk's co-rotation radius (R_co), calculated from the star's\nrotation period. We do not find obvious differences in the disk R_trunc of slow\nvs. rapid rotators. This holds true both at the level of whether close-in disk\nmaterial is present at all, and in analyzing the precise location of the inner\ndisk edge relative to the R_co amongst the subset of stars with close-in disk\nmaterial. One interpretation is that DL is unimportant for the IC 348 stars in\nour sample. Alternatively, if DL does operate, then it must operate on both the\nslow and rapid rotators, potentially producing both spin-up and spin-down\ntorques, and the transition from the disk-locked state to the disk-released\nstate must occur more rapidly than the stellar contraction timescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 22:22:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 17:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Development of such arrays for\nquantum computing requires fine control over QD size and spatial arrangement on\nthe sub-35 nm length scale. We employ fine-probe electron-beam irradiation to\nlocally decompose ambient hydrocarbons onto a bare Si (001) surface. These\ncarbonaceous patterns are annealed in UHV, forming ordered arrays of nanoscale\nSiC precipitates that serve as templates for subsequent Ge quantum dot\nself-assembly during heteroepitaxy. This templating approach has so far\nproduced interdot spacings down to 22.5 nm, and smaller spacings should be\npossible. We investigate the templated feature evolution during UHV processing\nto identify key mechanisms that must be controlled in order to preserve pattern\nfidelity and reduce broadening of the quantum dot size distribution. A key\nfinding is that the presence of a small background of excess carbon reduces Ge\nsurface diffusion, thereby suppressing coarsening to relatively high\ntemperatures. In fact, coarsening of the carbonaceous nanodot template prior to\nconversion to SiC can be a more important contributor to size dispersion, and\nmust be avoided through control of thermal budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 02:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}

During the rising\nperiod, the shape of the jet resembled a cylinder with helical structures on\nthe surface, while the mass of the jet was mainly distributed on the cylinder's\nshell. In the radial direction, the jet expanded successively at its western\nside. The radial expansion presented three distinct phases: the gradually\nexpanding phase, the fast expanding phase, and the steady phase. Each phase\nlasted for about 12 minutes.

Based on systematic first-principles studies of the\nepitaxial strain effect on the ferroelectric and magnetic properties of the\ntetragonal BiFeO3, we find that there exists a transition from C-type to G-type\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) phase at in-plane constant a ~ 3.905 {\\AA} when the\nferroelectric polarization is along [001] direction. Such magnetic phase\ntransition can be explained by the competition between the Heisenberg exchange\nconstant J1c and J2c under the influence of biaxial strain. Interestingly, when\nthe in-plane lattice constant enlarges, the preferred ferroelectric\npolarization tends to be canted and eventually lies in the plane (along [110]\ndirection). It is found that the orientation change of ferroelectric\npolarization, which can be realized by applying external electric-field, has\nsignificant impact on the Heisenberg exchange parameters and therefore the\nmagnetic orderings of tetragonal BiFeO3. For example, at a ~ 3.79 {\\AA}, an\nelectric field along [111] direction with magnitude of 2 MV/cm could change the\nmagnetic ordering from C-AFM to G-AFM.

We show\nthat two regimes arise, depending on the Reynolds number $Re$. At low Reynolds\nnumber, $Nu Pr^{-1/2}$ and $Re$ are a function of $Ra Pr^{-3/2}$. At large\nReynolds number $Nu Pr^{1/3}$ and $Re Pr$ are function only of $Ra Pr^{2/3}$\n(within logarithmic corrections). In practice, since $Nu$ is always close to\n$Ra^{1/3}$, this corresponds to a much weaker dependence of the heat transfer\nin the Prandtl number at low Reynolds number than at large Reynolds number.\nThis difference may solve an existing controversy between measurements in SF6\n(large $Re$) and in alcohol/water (lower $Re$). We link these regimes with a\npossible global bifurcation in the turbulent mean flow. We further show how a\nscaling theory could be used to describe these two regimes through a single\nuniversal function. This function presents a bimodal character for intermediate\nrange of Reynolds number. We explain this bimodality in term of two dissipation\nregimes, one in which fluctuation dominate, and one in which mean flow\ndominates. Altogether, our results provide a six parameters fit of the curve\n$Nu(Ra,Pr)$ which may be used to describe all measurements at $Pr\\ge 0.7$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 12:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This dissertation\ndescribes work in refining and improving a novel model of patchy reconnection,\nwhere only a small bundle of field lines is reconnected across a current sheet\nand forms a reconnected thin flux tube. Traditional models have not been able\nto explain why some of the observed SADs appear to be hot and relatively devoid\nof plasma. The present work shows that plasma depletion naturally occurs in\nflux tubes that are reconnected across nonuniform current sheets and slide\ntrough regions of decreasing magnetic field magnitude. Moreover, through a\ndetailed theoretical analysis of generalized thin flux tube equations, we show\nthat the addition to the model of pressure-driven parallel dynamics, as well as\ntemperature-dependent, anisotropic viscosity and thermal conductivity is\nessential for self-consistently producing gas-dynamic shocks inside reconnected\ntubes that heat and compress plasma to observed temperatures and densities. The\nshock thickness can be as long as the entire tube and heat can be conducted\nalong tube's legs, possibly driving chromospheric evaporation. We developed a\ncomputer program that solves numerically the thin flux tube equations that\ngovern the retraction of reconnected tubes. Simulations carried out with this\nprogram corroborate our theoretical predictions. A comparison of these\nsimulations with fully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations is\npresented to assess the validity of the thin flux tube model. We also present\nan observational method based on total emission measure and mean temperature to\ndetermine where in the current sheet a tube was reconnected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 13:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}

This model describes the separation properties of\noil-water mixtures, when a substance enforcing the mixing of the phases (a\nsurfactant) is added. However, the model is also closely connected with other\nCahn-Hilliard-type equations relevant in different types of applications. We\nfirst discuss the existence of a weak solution to the sixth-order model in the\ncase when the configuration potential of the system is of singular (e.g.,\nlogarithmic) type. Then, we study the behavior of the solutions in the case\nwhen the sixth order term is let tend to 0, proving convergence to solutions of\nthe fourth order system in a special case. The fourth order system is then\ninvestigated by a direct approach and existence of a weak solution is shown\nunder very general conditions by means of a fixed point argument. Finally,\nadditional properties of the solutions, like uniqueness and parabolic\nregularization are discussed, both for the sixth order and for the fourth order\nmodel, under more restrictive assumptions on the nonlinear diffusion term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 15:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 08:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

This is the first detection of a BAL,\nwhich is sometimes seen in powerful quasars with high accretion rates, in a BL\nLac object. The BAL was clearly detected in its spectra of two epochs at a high\nluminosity state taken in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), while it\ndisappeared in three SDSS spectra taken at a low luminosity state. The BAL and\nits variability pattern was also found in its historical multi-epoch spectra in\nthe literature, but has been overlooked previously. In its high resolution\nradio maps, PKS 0138-097 shows a core plus an one-sided parsec-scale jet. The\nBAL variability can be interpreted as follows: The optical emission is\ndominated by the core in a high state and by the jet in a low state, and the\nBAL material is located between the core and jet so that the BAL appears only\nwhen the core is shining. Our discovery suggests that outflows may also be\nproduced in active galactic nuclei at a low accreting state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 15:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

From December 2007 until June 2008 it was\nintensively observed in the very high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) band by the\nsingle-dish Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov telescope (MAGIC-I).\nAims: We aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of the\nblazar jet during active states. Methods: We performed a dense monitoring of\nthe source in VHE with MAGIC-I, and also collected complementary data in soft\nX-rays and optical-UV bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions\n(SED) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotron\nself--compton (SSC) framework. Results: The source showed intense and prolonged\ngamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (E > 200 GeV)\nseldom below the level of the Crab Nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.\nEight datasets of simultaneous optical-UV (KVA, Swift/UVOT), soft X-ray\n(Swift/XRT) and MAGIC-I VHE data were obtained during different outburst\nphases. The data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once the\nspectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework of\na single-zone SSC leptonic model. Conclusions: The main outcome of the study is\nthat within the homogeneous model high Doppler factors (40 <= delta <= 80) are\nneeded to reproduce the observed SED; but this model cannot explain the\nobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued that\ninhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme Doppler factors, more intense\nmagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour or\nsub-hour scale variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 15:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2012 12:06:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 14:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
