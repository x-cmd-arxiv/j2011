However, since such p-values are not probabilities that the\nnull hypotheses are true, empirical Bayes methods have been devised to estimate\nsuch posterior probabilities, called local false discovery rates (LFDRs) to\nemphasize the frequency interpretation of their priors. The main approaches to\nLFDR estimation, relying either on numerical algorithms to maximize likelihood\nor on the selection of smoothing parameters for nonparametric density\nestimation, lack the automatic nature of the methods of error rate control. To\nbegin filling the gap, this paper introduces automatic methods of LFDR\nestimation with proven asymptotic conservatism under the independence of\np-values but without strong parametric assumptions. Simulations indicate that\nthey remain conservative even for very small numbers of hypotheses. One of the\nproposed procedures enables interpreting the original FDR control rule in terms\nof LFDR estimation, thereby facilitating practical interpretation. The most\nconservative of the new procedures is applied to measured abundance levels of\n20 proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 16:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-03"}

The tests\nare made on different astrophysical objects, different (u,v) plane coverages\nand several signal-to-noise ratios to determine the minimal configuration\nneeded to reconstruct an image. We establish a methodology and we introduce the\nmean-square errors (MSE) to discuss the results. From the ~24000 simulations\nperformed for the benchmarking of image reconstruction with MiRA, we are able\nto classify the different regularizations in the context of the observations.\nWe find typical values of the regularization weight. A minimal (u,v) coverage\nis required to reconstruct an acceptable image, whereas no limits are found for\nthe studied values of the signal-to-noise ratio. We also show that\nsuper-resolution can be achieved with increasing performance with the (u,v)\ncoverage filling. Using image reconstruction with a sufficient (u,v) coverage\nis shown to be reliable. The choice of the main parameters of the\nreconstruction is tightly constrained. We recommend that efforts to develop\ninterferometric infrastructures should first concentrate on the number of\ntelescopes to combine, and secondly on improving the accuracy and sensitivity\nof the arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 17:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The\nmost used method to locate quantum critical points is the so called crossing\nmethod, where the estimates are obtained by comparing the mass gaps of two\ndistinct lattice sizes. The success of this method is due to its simplicity and\nthe ability to provide accurate results even considering relatively small\nlattice sizes. In this paper, we introduce an estimator that locates quantum\ncritical points by exploring the known distinct behavior of the entanglement\nentropy in critical and non critical systems. As a benchmark test, we use this\nnew estimator to locate the critical point of the quantum Ising chain and the\ncritical line of the spin-1 Blume-Capel quantum chain. The tricritical point of\nthis last model is also obtained. Comparison with the standard crossing method\nis also presented. The method we propose is simple to implement in practice,\nparticularly in density matrix renormalization group calculations, and provides\nus, like the crossing method, amazingly accurate results for quite small\nlattice sizes. Our applications show that the proposed method has several\nadvantages, as compared with the standard crossing method, and we believe it\nwill become popular in future numerical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 18:53:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 13:43:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 13:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Using\nfirst-principles density functional calculations, we show that the\nsubstitutional boron doping substantially reduces the Stone-Wales activation\nbarrier (from \\sim 7 eV to 2.54 eV).

As in previous, differential works we find a\ndistinct departure from ionization equilibrium in that the abundances of Fe I\nand Fe II differ by ~0.1 dex, with opposite sign for the RGB and TO stars. The\nalpha-element ratios are enhanced to 0.4 (RGB) and 0.3 dex (TO), respectively,\nand we also confirm strong variations in the O, Na, and Al/Fe abundance ratios.\nAccordingly, the light-element abundance patterns in one of the red giants can\nbe attributed to pollution by an early generation of massive SNe II. TO and RGB\nabundances are not significantly different, with the possible exception of Mg\nand Ti, which is, however, amplified by the patterns in one TO star,\nadditionally belonging to this early generation of GC stars. We discuss\ninterrelations of these light elements as a function of the GC metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Rather\nthan focus on one or more stable dark-matter particles, we instead consider a\nmulti-component framework in which the dark matter of the universe comprises a\nvast ensemble of interacting fields with a variety of different masses,\nmixings, and abundances. Moreover, rather than impose stability for each field\nindividually, we ensure the phenomenological viability of such a scenario by\nrequiring that those states with larger masses and Standard-Model decay widths\nhave correspondingly smaller relic abundances, and vice versa. In other words,\ndark-matter stability is not an absolute requirement in such a framework, but\nis balanced against abundance. This leads to a highly dynamical scenario in\nwhich cosmological quantities such as Omega_{CDM} experience non-trivial\ntime-dependences beyond those associated with the expansion of the universe.\nAlthough it may seem difficult to arrange an ensemble of states which have the\nrequired decay widths and relic abundances, we present one particular example\nin which this balancing act occurs naturally: an infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein\n(KK) states living in the bulk of large extra spacetime dimensions. Remarkably,\nthis remains true even if the stability of the KK tower itself is entirely\nunprotected. Thus theories with large extra dimensions --- and by extension,\ncertain limits of string theory --- naturally give rise to dynamical dark\nmatter. Such scenarios also generically give rise to a rich set of collider and\nastrophysical phenomena which transcend those usually associated with dark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 18:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Other temporal and\nresource-intensive domains including logistics planning, plant control and\nmanufacturing have also helped to focus the community on the modelling and\nreasoning issues that must be confronted to make planning technology meet the\nchallenges of application. The International Planning Competitions have acted\nas an important motivating fo rce behind the progress that has been made in\nplanning since 1998. The third com petition (held in 2002) set the planning\ncommunity the challenge of handling tim e and numeric resources. This\nnecessitated the development of a modelling langua ge capable of expressing\ntemporal and numeric properties of planning domains.

Determining\nwhether and when such transfers-of-control should occur is arguably the\nfundamental research problem in adjustable autonomy. Previous work has\ninvestigated various approaches to addressing this problem but has often\nfocused on individual agent-human interactions. Unfortunately, domains\nrequiring collaboration between teams of agents and humans reveal two key\nshortcomings of these previous approaches. First, these approaches use rigid\none-shot transfers of control that can result in unacceptable coordination\nfailures in multiagent settings. Second, they ignore costs (e.g., in terms of\ntime delays or effects on actions) to an agent's team due to such\ntransfers-of-control. To remedy these problems, this article presents a novel\napproach to adjustable autonomy, based on the notion of a transfer-of-control\nstrategy. A transfer-of-control strategy consists of a conditional sequence of\ntwo types of actions: (i) actions to transfer decision-making control (e.g.,\nfrom an agent to a user or vice versa) and (ii) actions to change an agent's\npre-specified coordination constraints with team members, aimed at minimizing\nmiscoordination costs. The goal is for high-quality individual decisions to be\nmade with minimal disruption to the coordination of the team. We present a\nmathematical model of transfer-of-control strategies. The model guides and\ninforms the operationalization of the strategies using Markov Decision\nProcesses, which select an optimal strategy, given an uncertain environment and\ncosts to the individuals and teams.

We also consider the problem of forgetting, i.e., distilling from a\nknowledge base only the part that is relevant to the set of queries constructed\nfrom a subset of the alphabet. While such process is computationally hard, it\nallows for a simplification of subsequent reasoning, and can thus be viewed as\na form of compilation: once the relevant part of a knowledge base has been\nextracted, all reasoning tasks to be performed can be simplified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 21:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-24"}

A modularized program for treating general service\ntime distributions was introduced in Bramson et al. [In Proc. ACM SIGMETRICS\n(2010) 275-286].

When the staggered field\nis commensurate with the magnetic interactions, an energy gap opens immediately\nand follows a power law as a function of the applied field, similar to the\nsituation in 1D. When the field competes with the interactions, a quantum phase\ntransition (QPT) occurs from a gapless, magnetically ordered phase at low\nfields to a gapped, disordered regime. We use a continuous-time Monte Carlo\nmethod to compute the staggered moment of the ordered phases and the spin gap\nof the disordered phases.

We apply this formalism to theories of dark\nmatter with p-wave annihilation, for which the relative-velocity-weighted\nannihilation cross section is \\sigma v=a+bv^2.

We find that even a very weak long-range repulsive tail in the\npair potential has a profound effect on nucleation: increasing the amplitude of\nthe repulsive Yukawa tail reduces significantly the free energy barrier height\nand therefore increases the liquid droplet nucleation rate. The method we\nintroduce for calculating the droplet density profile and free energy employs a\nfictitious external potential to stabilize a liquid droplet of the desired\nsize, i.e. with a given excess number of particles.

Here we give a more detailed account of our study,\ninvolving 3D numerical simulations with beta in the range 1 to 64, the largest\nvalue simulated to date, as well as 2D simulations of vortex-antivortex (v-av)\ncollisions to understand the possible relation to the new 3D phenomena.

The long duration and significant energy of\nthis `extended emission'(EE) poses a major challenge to the standard binary\nneutron star merger model. metzger08 recently proposed that the EE is powered\nby the spin-down of a strongly magnetized neutron star. However, the effects of\nsurrounding material on the magnetar outflow have not yet been considered.

The collision between the relativistic magnetar wind and the\nexpanding ejecta produces a magnetized nebula inside the ejecta. A strong\ntoroidal magnetic field builds up in the nebula, which drives a bipolar jet out\nthrough the ejecta, similar to the magnetar model developed in the case of long\nduration GRBs. We quantify the `break-out' time and opening angle of the jet\ntheta_j as a function of the wind energy flux dot{E} and ejecta mass M_ej. We\nshow that dot{E} and theta_j are inversely correlated, such that the\nbeaming-corrected (isotropic) luminosity of the jet is primarily a function of\nM_ej. Both variability arguments, and the lower limit on the power of magnetar\noutflows capable of producing bright emission, suggest that the true opening\nangle of the magnetar jet must be relatively large. The model thus predicts a\nclass of events for which the EE is observable with no associated short GRB.\nThese may appear as long-duration GRBs or X-Ray Flashes, which may be detected\nby future all-sky X-ray survey missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 09:55:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 13:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

An explosive transient with\nan un-observed shock break-out luminosity of order 10^10 Lsun is required to\nrender the transients little obscured and visible in the optical at their\npeaks. Such a large break-out luminosity then implies that the progenitor stars\nwere cool, red supergiants, most probably ~9 Msun extreme AGB (EAGB) stars. As\nthe shocks generated by the explosions propagate outward through the dense\nwind, they produce a shock luminosity in soft X-rays that powers the long-lived\nluminosity of the transients. Unlike typical cases of transients exploding into\na surrounding circumstellar medium, the progenitor winds in these systems are\noptically thick to soft X-rays, easily absorb radio emission and rapidly reform\ndust destroyed by the peak luminosity of the transients. As a result, X-rays\nare absorbed by the gas and the energy is ultimately radiated by the reformed\ndust. Three years post-peak, both systems are still significantly more luminous\nthan their progenitor stars, but they are again fully shrouded by the re-formed\ndust and only visible in the mid-IR. The high luminosity and heavy obscuration\nmay make it difficult to determine the survival of the progenitor stars for ~10\nyears. However, our model indicates that SN2008S, but not the NGC300-OT, should\nnow be a detectable X-ray source. SN2008S has a higher estimated shock velocity\nand a lower density wind, so the X-rays begin to escape at a much earlier\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 13:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The order is nontrivial\nbecause we can prove that the 1D system on the boundary must be gapless if the\nsymmetry is not broken, which generalizes the gaplessness of Wess-Zumino-Witten\nmodel for Lie symmetry groups to any discrete symmetry groups. The construction\nof this model is related to a nontrivial 3-cocycle of the $Z_2$ group and can\nbe generalized to any symmetry group. It potentially leads to a complete\nclassification of symmetry protected topological orders in interacting boson\nand fermion systems of any dimension.

From the\nComposition-Diamond lemma for associative algebras, it follows that the set of\nYoung tableaux is a linear basis of plactic algebra.

M 31 has been completely imaged for the first time obtaining a\nluminosity lower limit ~10^35 erg s-1 in the 0.2-4.5 keV band. Our XMM-Newton\nEPIC survey combines archival observations with observations taken between June\n2006 and February 2008. The main goal of the paper is a study of the X-ray\nsource population of M 31. Methods. An X-ray catalogue of 1897 sources was\ncreated; 914 were detected for the first time. Source classification and\nidentification were based on X-ray hardness ratios, spatial extent of the\nsources, and by cross correlating with catalogues in the X-ray, optical,\ninfrared and radio wavelengths. We also analysed the long-term variability of\nthe X-ray sources. Results. Fourteen of the 30 supersoft source candidates\nrepresent supersoft emission of optical novae. Many of the 25 supernova\nremnants (SNRs) and 31 SNR candidates lie within the 10 kpc dust ring and other\nstar forming regions in M 31; this connection between SNRs and star forming\nregions implies that most of the remnants originate in type II supernovae. The\nbrightest sources in X-rays in M 31 belong to the class of X-ray binaries\n(XRBs). Ten low mass XRBs (LMXBs) and 26 LMXB candidates were identified based\non their temporal variability. In addition 36 LMXBs and 17 LMXB candidates were\nidentified due to correlations with globular clusters and globular cluster\ncandidates. From optical and X-ray colour-colour diagrams, possible high mass\nXRB (HMXB) candidates were selected. Two of these candidates have an X-ray\nspectrum as is expected for an HMXB containing a neutron star primary.\nConclusions. While our survey has greatly improved our understanding of the\nX-ray source populations in M 31, at this point 65% of the sources can still\nonly be classified as \"hard\" sources. Deeper observations in X-ray and at other\nwavelengths would help classify these sources.
