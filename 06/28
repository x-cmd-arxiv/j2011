It amounts to exploring a state\nspace of planning domains typically modeled as a directed graph. However,\nprohibitively large sizes of the search space make search expensive. Developing\nbetter heuristic functions has been the main technique for improving search\nefficiency. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that improving heuristics\nalone has certain fundamental limits on improving search efficiency. Recently,\na new direction of research called partial order based reduction (POR) has been\nproposed as an alternative to improving heuristics. POR has shown promise in\nspeeding up searches.\n  POR has been extensively studied in model checking research and is a key\nenabling technique for scalability of model checking systems. Although the POR\ntheory has been extensively studied in model checking, it has never been\ndeveloped systematically for planning before. In addition, the conditions for\nPOR in the model checking theory are abstract and not directly applicable in\nplanning. Previous works on POR algorithms for planning did not establish the\nconnection between these algorithms and existing theory in model checking.\n  In this paper, we develop a theory for POR in planning. The new theory we\ndevelop connects the stubborn set theory in model checking and POR methods in\nplanning. We show that previous POR algorithms in planning can be explained by\nthe new theory. Based on the new theory, we propose a new, stronger POR\nalgorithm. Experimental results on various planning domains show further search\ncost reduction using the new algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 16:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-28"}

Methods.\nThe high sensitivity of HIFI, in combination with its high spectral resolution\ncapability, allows us to trace the H2O outflow wings at unprecedented\nsignal-to-noise. From the observation of spectrally resolved H2O and CO lines\nin the HH52-54 system, both from space and from ground, we arrive at the\nspatial and velocity distribution of the molecular outflow gas. Solving the\nstatistical equilibrium and non-LTE radiative transfer equations provides us\nwith estimates of the physical parameters of this gas, including the cooling\nrate ratios of the species. The radiative transfer is based on an ALI code,\nwhere we use the fact that variable shock strengths, distributed along the\nfront, are naturally implied by a curved surface. Based on observations of CO\nand H2O spectral lines, we conclude that the emission is confined to the HH54\nregion. The quantitative analysis of our observations favours a ratio of the\nCO-to-H2O-cooling-rate >> 1. From the best-fit model to the CO emission, we\narrive at an H2O abundance close to 1e-5. The line profiles exhibit two\ncomponents, one of which is triangular and another, which is a superposed,\nadditional feature. This additional feature likely originates from a region\nsmaller than the beam where the ortho-water abundance is smaller than in the\nquiescent gas. Comparison with recent shock models indicate that a planar shock\ncan not easily explain the observed line strengths and triangular line\nprofiles.We conclude that the geometry can play an important role.

The determined cell parameters\nwere: a = 8.5705(3){\\AA}, b = 8.5629(3) {\\AA}, and c = 12.1198(4){\\AA}, and\ncell volume, V = 889.45(5) {\\AA}3 with Z = 4. Magnetic properties in single\ncrystals of the new boracite, were determined. The Susceptibility-Temperature\n(X -T) behavior at different magnetic intensities was studied. The inverse of\nthe magnetic susceptibility X-1(T) shows a Curie-Weiss characteristic with spin\ns = 3/2 and a small orbital contribution, l. At low temperatures, below 10 K,\nX(T) shows irreversibility that is strongly dependent on the applied magnetic\nfield. This boracite is ferrimagnetic up to a maximum temperature of about 16\nK, as shows the coercive field. The reduction of the irreversibility by the\ninfluence of the magnetic field, may be related to a metamagnetic phase\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 17:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-28"}

Aims: Disentangling\nthe relative contributions of the different ISM phases to [CII] emission, is a\nmajor topic of the HerM33es program, a Herschel key project to study the ISM in\nthe nearby spiral galaxy M33. Methods: Using PACS, we have mapped the emission\nof [CII] 158 micron, [OI] 63 micron, and other FIR lines in a 2'x2' region of\nthe northern spiral arm of M33, centered on the HII region BCLMP302. At the\npeak of H-alpha emission, we have observed in addition a velocity resolved\n[CII] spectrum using HIFI. We use scatterplots to compare these data with PACS\n160 micron continuum maps, and with maps of CO and HI data, at a common\nresolution of 12 arcsec or 50 pc. Maps of H-alpha and 24 micron emission\nobserved with Spitzer are used to estimate the SFR. We have created maps of the\n[CII] and [OI] 63 micron emission and detected [NII] 122 micron and NIII 57\nmicron at individual positions. Results: The [CII] line observed with HIFI is\nsignificantly broader than that of CO, and slightly blue-shifted. In addition,\nthere is little spatial correlation between [CII] observed with PACS and CO\nover the mapped region. There is even less spatial correlation between [CII]\nand the atomic gas traced by HI. Detailed comparison of the observed\nintensities towards the HII region with models of photo ionization and photon\ndominated regions, confirms that a significant fraction, 20--30%, of the\nobserved [CII] emission stems from the ionized gas and not from the molecular\ncloud. The gas heating efficiency, using the ratio between [CII] and the TIR as\na proxy, varies between 0.07 and 1.5%, with the largest variations found\noutside the HII region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 17:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Linear coupling to lattice (Peierls) phonons and\nmolecular (Holstein) vibrations are treated in the adiabatic approximation. The\nmolar magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_M(T)$ is obtained directly up to $N = 10$.\nThe goal is to find the consequences of a doubly degenerate ground state (gs)\nand finite magnetic gap $E_m$ in a regular array. Degenerate gs with broken\ninversion symmetry are constructed for finite $N$ for a range of $V$ near the\ncharge density wave (CDW) boundary at $V \\approx 2.18t$ where $E_m \\approx\n0.5t$ is large.

We have argued in Broderick et al. (2011,\nPaper I) that plasma beam instabilities can dissipate the pairs' energy\nlocally. This heats the intergalactic medium and dramatically increases its\nentropy after redshift z~2, with important implications for structure\nformation: (1) This suggests a scenario for the origin of the cool core\n(CC)/non-cool core (NCC) bimodality in galaxy clusters and groups. Early\nforming galaxy groups are unaffected because they can efficiently radiate the\nadditional entropy, developing a CC. However, late forming groups do not have\nsufficient time to cool before the entropy is gravitationally reprocessed\nthrough successive mergers - counteracting cooling and raising the core entropy\nfurther. Hence blazar heating works different than feedback by active galactic\nnuclei, which balances radiative cooling but is unable to transform CC into NCC\nclusters due to the weak coupling to the cluster gas. (2) We predict a\nsuppression of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum on angular scales smaller\nthan 5' due to the globally reduced central pressure of groups and clusters\nforming after z~1. (3) Our redshift dependent entropy floor increases the\ncharacteristic halo mass below which dwarf galaxies cannot form by a factor of\n~10 (50) at mean density (in voids) over that found in models that include\nphotoionization alone.

Further, it has been recently understood that\nnon-Gaussianity in the initial conditions could show up in a scale dependence\nof the bias of galaxies at the largest distances. It is therefore important to\ninclude General Relativistic effects. Here we provide a General Relativistic\ngeneralization of the bias, valid both for Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial\nconditions. The collapse of objects happens on very small scales, while\nlong-wavelength modes are always in the quasi linear regime. Around every\ncollapsing region, it is therefore possible to find a reference frame that is\nvalid for all times and where the space time is almost flat: the Fermi frame.\nHere the Newtonian approximation is applicable and the equations of motion are\nthe ones of the N-body codes. The effects of long-wavelength modes are encoded\nin the mapping from the cosmological frame to the local frame. For the linear\nbias, the effect of the long-wavelength modes on the dynamics is encoded in the\nlocal curvature of the Universe, which allows us to define a General\nRelativistic generalization of the bias in the standard Newtonian setting. We\nshow that the bias due to this effect goes to zero as the squared ratio of the\nphysical wavenumber with the Hubble scale for modes longer than the horizon, as\nmodes longer than the horizon have no dynamical effects. However, the bias due\nto non-Gaussianities does not need to vanish for modes longer than the Hubble\nscale, and for non-Gaussianities of the local kind it goes to a constant. As a\nfurther application, we show that it is not necessary to perform large N-body\nsimulations to extract information on long-wavelength modes: N-body simulations\ncan be done on small scales and long-wavelength modes are encoded simply by\nadding curvature to the simulation and rescaling the coordinates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 20:01:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2011 00:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We model the detailed physics of these\nfast accretion shocks, and apply these to a simple 1-D spherical hydrodynamic\naccretion model for baryonic infall in dark matter halos with an Einasto\ndensity distribution. The escape of UV photons from these halos is delayed by\nthe time taken to reach the critical accretion shock velocity for escape of UV\nphotons; 220 km s$^{-1}$, and by the time it takes for these photons to ionize\nthe surrounding baryonic matter in the accretion flow. Assuming that in the\nuniverse at large the baryonic matter tracks the dark matter, we can estimate\nthe epoch of re-ionization in the case that accretion shocks act alone as the\nsource of UV photons. We find that 50% of the volume (and 5-8% of the mass) of\nthe universe can be ionized by $z \\sim 7-8$. The UV production rate has an\nuncertainty of a factor of about 5 due to uncertainties in the cosmological\nparameters controlling the development of large scale structure.

By taking as initial condition of the renormalization-group\nflow the (local) limit of decoupled sites, we take into account both local and\nlong-distance fluctuations in a nontrivial way. This approach yields a phase\ndiagram in very good quantitative agreement with quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations, and reproduces the two universality classes of the\nsuperfluid--Mott-insulator transition. The critical behavior near the\nmulticritical points, where the transition takes place at constant density,\nagrees with the original predictions of Fisher {\\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf\n40}, 546 (1989)] based on simple scaling arguments. At a generic transition\npoint, the critical behavior is mean-field like with logarithmic corrections in\ntwo dimensions. In the weakly-correlated superfluid phase (far away from the\nMott insulating phase), the renormalization-group flow is controlled by the\nBogoliubov fixed point down to a characteristic (Ginzburg) momentum scale $k_G$\nwhich is much smaller than the inverse healing length $k_h$. In the vicinity of\nthe multicritical points, when the density is commensurate, we identify a sharp\ncrossover from a weakly- to a strongly-correlated superfluid phase where the\ncondensate density and the superfluid stiffness are strongly suppressed and\nboth $k_G$ and $k_h$ are of the order of the inverse lattice spacing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 08:09:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 13:36:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 14:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-12"}

This is confirmed in hydro-AMR\nzoom-in simulations of galaxies in a cosmological context. In most high-z\nclumps, the centrifugal force dominates the support, R=Vrot^2/Vcirc^2 > 0.5,\nwhere Vrot is the rotation velocity and Vcirc is the circular velocity. The\nclump spin indeed tends to be in the sense of the global disc angular momentum,\nbut substantial tilts are frequent. Most clumps are in Jeans equilibrium, with\nthe rest of the support provided by turbulence. Simulations of isolated\ngas-rich discs that resolve the clump substructure reveal that the cosmological\nsimulations may overestimate R by ~30%, but the dominance of rotational support\nat high-z is not a resolution artifact. In turn, isolated gas-poor disc\nsimulations produce at z=0 smaller gaseous non-rotating transient clouds,\nindicating that the difference in rotational support is associated with the\nfraction of cold baryons in the disc. In our current cosmological simulations,\nthe clump rotation velocity is typically Vrot~100 km/s, but when beam smearing\nof \\geq 0.1 arcsec is imposed, the rotation signal is reduced to a small\ngradient of \\leq 30 km/s/kpc across the clump. The velocity dispersion in the\nsimulated clumps is comparable to the disc dispersion so it is expected to\nleave only a marginal signal. Retrograde minor-merging galaxies could lead to\nmassive clumps that do not show rotation.Testable predictions of the scenario\nas simulated are that the mean stellar age of the clumps, and the stellar\nfraction, are declining linearly with distance from the disc center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 08:19:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 15:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We have re-examined the\nevidence for the Bosma effect by fitting Bosma effect models for 17 galaxies in\nthe THINGS data set, either by scaling the contribution of the HI gas alone or\nby using both the observed stellar disc and HI gas as proxies. The results are\ncompared with two models for exotic cold DM: internally consistent cosmological\nNFW models with constrained compactness parameters, and URC models using fully\nunconstrained Burkert density profiles. The Bosma models that use the stellar\ndiscs as additional proxies are statistically nearly as good as the URC models\nand clearly better than the NFW ones. We thus confirm the correlation between\nthe centripetal effects of DM and that of the interstellar medium of spiral\ngalaxies. The edificacy of \"maximal disc\" models is explained as the natural\nconsequence of \"classic\" Bosma models which include the stellar disc as a proxy\nin regions of reduced atomic gas. The standard explanation - that the effect\nreflects a statistical correlation between the visible and exotic DM - seems\nhighly unlikely, given that the geometric forms and hence centripetal\nsignatures of spherical halo and disc components are so different.

In\nparallel, modeling has been established as a tool to relate network structure\nto activity dynamics. While the available connectivity maps have been used in\nvarious computational studies, prominent features of the simulated activity\nsuch as the spontaneous firing rates do not match the experimental findings.\nHere, we show that the inconsistency arises from the incompleteness of the\nconnectivity maps. Our comparison of the most comprehensive maps (Thomson et\nal., 2002; Binzegger et al., 2004) reveals their main discrepancies: the\nlateral sampling range and the specific selection of target cells. Taking them\ninto account, we compile an integrated connectivity map and analyze the unified\nmap by simulations of a full scale model of the local layered cortical network.\nThe simulated spontaneous activity is asynchronous irregular and the cell-type\nspecific spontaneous firing rates are in agreement with in vivo recordings in\nawake animals, including the low rate of layer 2/3 excitatory cells. Similarly,\nthe activation patterns evoked by transient thalamic inputs reproduce recent in\nvivo measurements. The correspondence of simulation results and experiments\nrests on the consideration of specific target type selection and thereby on the\nintegration of a large body of the available connectivity data. The cell-type\nspecific hierarchical input structure and the combination of feed-forward and\nfeedback connections reveal how the interplay of excitation and inhibition\nshapes the spontaneous and evoked activity of the local cortical network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 14:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-29"}

At the moment, the mean SED of SgrA* is only known\nreliably in the radio to mm regimes. The goal of this paper is to provide\nconstraints on the mean emission from SgrA* in the near-to-mid infrared.\nExcellent imaging quality was reached in the MIR by using speckle imaging\ncombined with holographic image reconstruction, a novel technique for this kind\nof data. No counterpart of SgrA* is detected at 8.6 microns. At this\nwavelength, SgrA* is located atop a dust ridge, which considerably complicates\nthe search for a potential point source. An observed 3 sigma upper limit of ~10\nmJy is estimated for the emission of SgrA* at 8.6 microns, a tighter limit at\nthis wavelength than in previous work. The de-reddened 3 sigma upper limit,\nincluding the uncertainty of the extinction correction, is ~84 mJy . Based on\nthe available data, it is argued that, with currently available instruments,\nSgrA* cannot be detected in the MIR, not even during flares. At 4.8 and 3.8\nmicrons, on the other hand, SgrA* is detected at all times, at least when\nconsidering timescales of a few up to 13 min. We derive well-defined\ntime-averaged, de-reddened flux densities of 3.8+-1.3 mJy at 4.8 microns and\n5.0+-0.6 mJy at 3.8 microns. Observations with NIRC2/Keck and NaCo/VLT from the\nliterature provide good evidence that SgrA* also has a fairly well-defined\nde-reddened mean flux of 0.5-2.5 mJy at wavelengths of 2.1-2.2 microns. We\npresent well-constrained anchor points for the SED of SgrA* on the\nhigh-frequency side of the Terahertz peak. The new data are in general\nagreement with published theoretical SEDs of the mean emission from SgrA*, but\nwe expect them to have an appreciable impact on the model parameters in future\ntheoretical work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 14:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

However, advances in\ncommunication technology means that the 'lifetime' of important information is\ntypically short. Hence, viewed as a tradable asset, information shares the\ncharacteristics of a perishable commodity: while it can be stored and\ntransmitted freely, its worth diminishes rapidly in time. In view of recent\ndevelopments where internet search engines and other information providers are\noffering information to financial institutions, the problem of pricing\ninformation is becoming increasingly important. With this in mind, a new\nformulation of utility-indifference argument is introduced and used as a basis\nfor pricing information. Specifically, we regard information as a quantity that\nconverts a prior distribution into a posterior distribution. The amount of\ninformation can then be quantified by relative entropy. The key to our utility\nindifference argument is to equate the maximised a posterior utility, after\npaying certain cost for the information, with the a posterior expectation of\nthe utility based on the a priori optimal strategy. This formulation leads to\none price for a given quantity of upside information; and another price for a\ngiven quantity of downside information. The ideas are illustrated by means of\nsimple examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 15:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 10:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-05"}
