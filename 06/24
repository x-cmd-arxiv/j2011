The control parameters are chosen such that there is a significant\nvariation of density of the gas in going from the bottom to the top of the\nlayer. The relations between the Rayleigh, Peclet and Nusselt numbers depend on\nthe density stratification. It is proposed to use a data reduction which\naccounts for the variable density by introducing into the scaling laws an\neffective density. The relevant density is the geometric mean of the maximum\nand minimum densities in the layer. A good fit to the data is then obtained\nwith power laws with the same exponent as for fluids in the Boussinesq limit.\nTwo relations connect the top and bottom boundary layers: The kinetic energy\ndensities computed from free fall velocities are equal at the top and bottom,\nand the products of free fall velocities and maximum horizontal velocities are\nequal for both boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 16:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 16:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Regular tetrahedra\nhave attracted particular attention because they prefer local symmetries that\nare incompatible with periodicity. Two dense phases of regular tetrahedra have\nbeen reported recently. The densest known tetrahedron packing is achieved in a\ncrystal of triangular bipyramids (dimers) with packing density\n4000/4671=85.63%. In simulation a dodecagonal quasicrystal is observed; its\napproximant, with periodic tiling (3.4.3^2.4), can be compressed to a packing\nfraction of 85.03%. Here, we show that the quasicrystal approximant is more\nstable than the dimer crystal for packing densities below 84% using Monte Carlo\ncomputer simulations and free energy calculations. To carry out the free energy\ncalculations, we use a variation of the Frenkel-Ladd method for anisotropic\nshapes and thermodynamic integration. The enhanced stability of the approximant\ncan be attributed to a network substructure, which maximizes the free volume\n(and hence the 'wiggle room') available to the particles and facilitates\ncorrelated motion of particles, which further contributes to entropy and leads\nto diffusion for packing densities below 65%. The existence of a solid-solid\ntransition between structurally distinct phases not related by symmetry\nbreaking -- the approximant and the dimer crystal-- is unusual for hard\nparticle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 16:20:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2011 18:56:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 10:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-24"}

In this paper we explore\nthis question using a reasonably general clock model, solved using path\nintegral methods. We find that in the weak coupling regime where the energy of\nthe clock is much less than the energy of the particle it is measuring, the\nprobability for the clock pointer can be expressed in terms of the probability\ncurrent in the case of arrival times, and the dwell time operator in the case\nof dwell times, the expected semiclassical results. In the regime of strong\nsystem-clock coupling, we find that the arrival time probability is\nproportional to the kinetic energy density, consistent with an earlier model\ninvolving a complex potential.

The population is divided into a fixed large number\nof groups of fixed size. From generation to generation, new groups are formed\nthat descend from previous groups, through a two-level Fisher-Wright process,\nwith selection between groups and within groups and with migration between\ngroups at rate $m$. When $m=1$, the framework reduces to the often used\ntrait-group framework, so that our setting can be seen as an extension of that\napproach. Our framework allows the analysis of previously introduced models in\nwhich altruists and non-altruists compete, and provides new insights into these\nmodels. We focus on the situation in which initially there is a single\naltruistic allele in the population, and no further mutations occur. The main\nquestions are conditions for the viability of that altruistic allele to spread,\nand the fashion in which it spreads when it does. Because our results and\nmethods are rigorous, we see them as shedding light on various controversial\nissues in this field, including the role of Hamilton's rule, and of the Price\nequation, the relevance of linearity in fitness functions and the need to only\nconsider pairwise interactions, or weak selection. In this paper we analyze the\nearly stages of the evolution, during which the number of altruists is small\ncompared to the size of the population. We show that during this stage the\nevolution is well described by a multitype branching process. The driving\nmatrix for this process can be obtained, reducing the problem of determining\nwhen the altruistic gene is viable to a comparison between the leading\neigenvalue of that matrix, and the fitness of the non-altruists before the\naltruistic gene appeared. This leads to a generalization of Hamilton's\ncondition for the viability of a mutant gene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 17:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-24"}

As there may be many answers to this\nquestion, we isolate a necessary condition, the SPASs property, that should be\nsatisfied by any reasonable notion of SPASs. This requires that if two theories\nconform to a common notion of SPASs, with one a subtheory of the other, and are\nisomorphic in some particular spacetime, then they should be isomorphic in all\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes (of given dimension). The SPASs property is\nformulated in a functorial setting broad enough to describe general physical\ntheories describing processes in spacetime, subject to very minimal\nassumptions. By explicit constructions, the full class of locally covariant\ntheories is shown not to satisfy the SPASs property, establishing that there is\nno notion of SPASs encompassing all such theories. It is also shown that all\nlocally covariant theories obeying the time-slice property possess two local\nsubstructures, one kinematical (obtained directly from the functorial\nstructure) and the other dynamical (obtained from a natural form of dynamics,\ntermed relative Cauchy evolution). The covariance properties of relative Cauchy\nevolution and the kinematic and dynamical substructures are analyzed in detail.\nCalling local covariant theories dynamically local if their kinematical and\ndynamical local substructures coincide, it is shown that the class of\ndynamically local theories fulfills the SPASs property.

We analyse the linear\ndynamics of non-axisymmetric convection and spiral density waves in a Keplerian\ndisc with superadiabatic vertical stratification using the local shearing box\napproach. It is demonstrated that the shear associated with Keplerian\ndifferential rotation introduces a novel phenomenon, it causes these two\nperturbation modes to become coupled: during evolution the convective mode\ngenerates (trailing) spiral density waves and can therefore be regarded as a\nnew source of spiral density waves in discs. The wave generation process\nstudied here owes its existence solely to shear of the disc's differential\nrotation, and is a special manifestation of a more general linear mode coupling\nphenomena universally taking place in flows with an inhomogeneous velocity\nprofile.

It is designed to yield good dipole polarizabilities and\nimproved intermolecular potentials with dispersion terms. The molecular\nintegrals include up to three-center one-electron and two-center two-electron\nterms, all in simple analytical forms. A method to extract the effective\none-electron Hamiltonian of nonlocal-exchange Kohn-Sham theory from the\ncoupled-cluster one-electron density matrix is designed and used to get its\nmatrix representation in a molecule-intrinsic minimal basis as an input to the\nparamtrization procedure -- making a direct link to the correlated wavefunction\ntheory. The model has been trained for 15 elements (H, Li--F, Na--Cl, 720\nparameters) on a set of 5581 molecules (including ions, transition states, and\nweakly-bound complexes) whose first- and second-order properties were computed\nby the coupled-cluster theory as a reference, and a good agreement is seen. The\nmodel looks promising for the study of large molecular systems, it is believed\nto be an important step forward from the traditional semiempirical models\ntowards higher accuracy at nearly as low a computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 18:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 14:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

We extend previous studies of\nnoninteracting traps to the case where the traps have on-site electron\nrepulsion inside one ballistic channel. The repulsion not only allows the\nappropriate temperature dependence of 1/f noise, but also is a control to the\ncoupling between the computational qubit and the spurious two-level systems\ninside the oxide dielectric. We use second order perturbation theory which\nallows to obtain analytical formulae for the interacting bound states and\nspectral weights, limited to small and intermediate repulsions.

Using simple observationally-motivated heating\nprescriptions, we show that local thermal instability (TI) can produce a\nmulti-phase medium---with ~ 10000 K cold filaments condensing out of the hot\nICM---only when the ratio of the TI timescale in the hot plasma (t_{TI}) to the\nfree-fall timescale (t_{ff}) satisfies t_{TI}/t_{ff} <~ 10. This criterion\nquantitatively explains why cold gas and star formation are preferentially\nobserved in low-entropy clusters and groups. In addition, the interplay among\nheating, cooling, and TI reduces the net cooling rate and the mass accretion\nrate at small radii by factors of ~ 100 relative to cooling-flow models. This\ndramatic reduction is in line with observations. The feedback efficiency\nrequired to prevent a cooling-flow is ~ 0.001 for clusters and decreases for\nlower mass halos; supernova heating may be energetically sufficient to balance\ncooling in galactic halos. We further argue that the ICM self-adjusts so that\nt_{TI}/t_{ff} >~ 10 at all radii. When this criterion is not satisfied, cold\nfilaments condense out of the hot phase and reduce the density of the ICM.\nThese cold filaments can power the black hole and/or stellar feedback required\nfor global thermal balance, which drives t_{TI}/t_{ff} >~ 10. In comparison to\nclusters, groups have central cores with lower densities and larger radii. This\ncan account for the deviations from self-similarity in the X-ray\nluminosity-temperature (L_X-T_X) relation. The high-velocity clouds observed in\nthe Galactic halo can also be due to local TI producing multi-phase gas close\nto the virial radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

On the other five branches, the static solutions are all\n{\\it singular} far from the source, and shuttered off from asymptotic infinity.\nOne of them, however, is really the self-accelerating branch, and the\nsingularity is removed by turning on time dependence. We give examples of\nregulated solutions, where the Dyson sphere explodes outward, and its\nself-accelerating side is nonsingular. These constructions may open channels\nfor nonperturbative transitions between branches, which need to be addressed\nfurther to determine phenomenological viability of multi-branch gravities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 20:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A strong\nmodel dependence and no overall correlation of the value of the transition\ntemperature to the strength of the interaction is found.

Hence, the soliton can be naturally regarded as a degenerate\nground state labeled by a single modulus parameter.

A highly significant trend for decreasing\ngamma values with increasing 2-10 keV luminosity, L_X, is seen but only a weak\ntrend with redshift is found. Intrinsic cold absorption is detected in ~4% of\nthe sample and soft excess emission is detected in ~8%. These values are lower\nlimits due to the detectability being limited by the quality of the spectra and\nwe suggest the intrinsic values may be as high as ~25% and ~80% respectively.\nThe levels of rest-frame absorption are higher than expected for type 1 objects\n(N_H = 10^21-10^23 cm^-2) and the fraction of absorbed sources and the N_H\nvalues are not seen to vary with L_X or z. The average blackbody temperature\nused to model the soft excesses is <kT> = 0.17 +/- 0.09 keV. This temperature\nis found to correlate with L_X but not the blackbody luminosity or the black\nhole mass which do correlate with each other. A strong correlation is found\nbetween the luminosities in the blackbody and power law components suggesting\nthat a similar fraction is re-processed from the blackbody to the power law\ncomponent for the entire luminosity range of objects. . .

However, a simple Michie model in\nNewtonian gravity with anisotropic velocity dispersion provides an excellent\nrepresentation of the luminosity profile and kinematics. In contrast, with MOND\nwe find that Michie models that reproduce the luminosity profile either\nover-predict the velocity dispersion on the outskirts of the cluster if the\nmass to light ratio is kept at astrophysically-motivated values, or else they\nunder-predict the central velocity dispersion if the mass to light ratio is\ntaken to be very small.

In some cases, e. g. for supergiant stars, the displacement can\nbe a non-negligible fraction of the star radius R, and if R>1 AU, of the\nparallax. We investigate the impact of surface brightness asymmetries on both\nthe Gaia astrometric solution and the data processing flow with a theoretical\napproach. We show that when the amplitude of the displacement is comparable to\nthe epoch astrometric precision, the resulting astrometric solution of a\ngenuine single star may be, in some cases, of low quality (with some parameters\nup to 10 sigma off). In this case, we provide an analytical prediction of the\nimpact of the photocentre motion on both chi squared and the uncertainty in the\nastrometric parameters. Non-single star solutions are found, if allowed for the\nclosest stars. A closer look at the parameters of the orbital solutions reveals\nhowever that they are spurious (since the semi-major axis is smaller than\neither its error or the stellar radius). It is thus possible to filter out\nthose spurious orbital solutions.

They can be\nformally considered as enzymes that simultaneously catalyze two chemical\nreactions: the free energy-donating reaction and the free energy-accepting one.\nMost if not all biologically active proteins display a slow stochastic dynamics\nof transitions between a variety of conformational substates composing their\nnative state. In the steady state, this dynamics is characterized by mean\nfirst-passage times between transition substates of the catalyzed reactions. On\ntaking advantage of the assumption that each reaction proceeds through a single\npair (the gate) of conformational transition substates of the enzyme-substrates\ncomplex, analytical formulas were derived for the flux-force dependence of the\nboth reactions, the respective stalling forces and the degree of coupling\nbetween the free energy-accepting (output) reaction flux and the free\nenergy-donating (input) one. The theory is confronted with the results of\nrandom walk simulations on the 5-dimensional hypercube. The formal proof is\ngiven that in the case of reactions proceeding through single gates, the degree\nof coupling cannot exceed unity. As some experiments suggest such exceeding,\nlooking for conditions of increasing the degree of coupling over unity\nchallenges theory. Though no analytical formulas for models involving more\ntransition substates are available, study simulations of random walks on\nseveral model networks indicate that the case of the degree of coupling value\nhigher than one occurs in a natural way for scale-free tree-like networks. This\nsupports a hypothesis that the protein conformational transition networks, like\nhigher level biological networks: the proteome and the metabolome, have evolved\nin a process of self-organized criticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 12:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

The AD produces\nthe ionizing continuum which powers the broad and narrow emission lines. The\nmaximum AD effective temperature is given by Teff=fmax(Mdot/M^2)^1/4, where M\nis the black hole mass, Mdot the accretion rate, and fmax is set by the black\nhole spin a_*. For a low enough value of Mdot/M^2 the AD may become too cold to\nproduce ionizing photons. Such an object will form a lineless quasar. This\noccurs for a local blackbody (BB) AD with a luminosity Lopt=10^46 erg/s for\nM>3.6E9 Msun, when a_*=0, and for M>1.4E10 Msun, when a_*=0.998. Using the AD\nbased Mdot, derived from M and Lopt, and the reverberation based M, derived\nfrom Lopt and the Hbeta FWHM, v, gives Teff \\propto Lopt^-0.13v^-1.45. Thus,\nTeff is mostly set by v. Quasars with a local BB AD become lineless for v>\n8,000 km/s, when a_*=0, and for v> 16,000 km/s, when a_*=0.998. Higher values\nof v are required if the AD is hotter than a local BB. The AD becoming\nnon-ionizing may explain why line emitting quasars with v>10,000 km/s are rare.\nWeak low ionization lines may still be present if the X-ray continuum is\nluminous enough, and such objects may form a population of weak emission line\nquasars (WLQ). If correct, such WLQ should show a steeply falling SED at\nlambda<1000A. Such an SED was observed by Hryniewicz et al. in SDSS\nJ094533.99+100950.1, a WLQ observed down to 570A, which is well modeled by a\nrather cold AD SED. UV spectroscopy of z~1-2 quasars is required to eliminate\npotential intervening Lyman limit absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM),\nand to explore if the SEDs of lineless quasars and some additional WLQ are also\nwell fit by a cold AD SED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 13:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

After recalling\nthe standard formulation of the FIT, the proposed mesh adaptation procedure is\ndescribed. Besides the linear interpolation approach, a novel interpolation\ntechnique based on specialized spline functions for approximating the discrete\nelectromagnetic field solution during mesh adaptation is introduced. The\nstandard FIT on a fixed mesh and the new adaptive approach are applied to a\nsimulation test case with known analytical solution. The numerical accuracy of\nthe two methods are shown to be comparable. The dynamic mesh approach is,\nhowever, much more efficient. This is also demonstrated for the full scale\nmodeling of the complete RF gun at the Photo Injector Test Facility DESY\nZeuthen (PITZ) on a single computer.

There exists an infinite number of choices leading to different\nphysical predictions. In stationary scenarios, a common strategy is to select a\nvacuum (or a family of unitarily equivalent vacua) by requiring invariance\nunder the spacetime symmetries. When stationarity is lost, a natural\ngeneralization consists in replacing time invariance by unitarity in the\nevolution. We prove that, when the spatial sections are compact, the criterion\nof a unitary dynamics, together with the invariance under the spatial\nisometries, suffices to select a unique family of Fock quantizations for a\nscalar field with time dependent mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 15:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 09:06:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 21:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-24"}

The\nmotivation is to understand the tidal interaction between short-period planets\nand their solar-type host stars, which involves the launching of gravity waves\nat the top of the radiation zone that propagate towards the stellar centre.\nStudying the instabilities of these waves near the centre, where nonlinearities\nare most important, is essential, since it may have implications for the\nsurvival of these planets. When the waves have sufficient amplitude to overturn\nthe stratification, they break and form a critical layer, which efficiently\nabsorbs subsequent ingoing wave angular momentum, and can result in the planet\nspiralling into the star. However, previous simulations do not find the waves\nto undergo instability for smaller amplitudes. This work has two aims: to\ndetermine any instabilities that set in for small-amplitude waves, and to\nfurther understand the breaking of large-amplitude waves. Our main result is\nthat the waves undergo parametric instabilities for any amplitude. However,\nbecause the nonlinearity is spatially localised in the innermost wavelengths,\ntheir growth rates are sufficiently small that they do not result in\nastrophysically important tidal dissipation. The resulting modified tidal\nquality factors are estimated to be Q'_star>10^7, and possibly much greater, so\nthe dissipation is much weaker than that which results from critical-layer\nabsorption. These results support our explanation for the survival of all\ncurrently observed short-period planets around solar-type main-sequence stars:\nthat planets unable to cause wave breaking at the centre of their host stars\nare likely to survive against tidal decay. This hypothesis will be tested by\nongoing and future observations of transiting planets, such as WASP and Kepler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 15:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Voltage is controlled directly at the head of the line\n(sub-station), however, voltage anywhere further down the line is subject to\nfluctuations, caused by irregularities of real and reactive distributed power\nconsumption/generation. The lack of a direct control of voltage along the line\nmay result in the voltage instability, also called voltage collapse -\nphenomenon well known and documented in the power engineering literature.\nMotivated by emerging photo-voltaic technology, which brings a new source of\nrenewable generation but also contributes significant increase in power flow\nfluctuations, we reexamine the phenomenon of voltage stability and collapse. In\nthe limit where the number of consumers is large and spatial variations in\npower flows are smooth functions of position along the feeder, we derive a set\nof the power flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), verify phenomenon of\nvoltage collapse, and study the effect of disorder and irregularity in\ninjection and consumption on the voltage profile by simulating the stochastic\nODE. We observe that disorder leads to nonlinear amplification of the voltage\nvariations at the end of the line as the point of voltage collapse is\napproached. We also find that the disorder, when correlated on a scale\nsufficiently small compared to the length of the line, self-averages, i.e. the\nvoltage profile remains spatially smooth for any individual realization of the\ndisorder and is correlated only at scales comparable to the length of the line.\nFinally, we explain why the integrated effect of disorder on the voltage at the\nend of the line cannot be described within a naive one-generator-one-load\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 15:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-27"}
