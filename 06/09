Our approach is to construct an\nundirected graph G and to heuristically obtain node multicolorings for G that\ncan be turned into efficient link schedules. In G each node represents a link\nto be scheduled and the edges are set up to represent every possible\ninterference for any given set of interference assumptions. We present two\nmulticoloring-based heuristics and study their performance through extensive\nsimulations. One of the two heuristics is based on relaxing the notion of a\nnode multicoloring by dynamically exploiting the availability of communication\nopportunities that would otherwise be wasted.

A distinct characteristic of these\nsystems is the fact that the nodes can harvest energy throughout the duration\nin which communication takes place. As such, transmission policies of the nodes\nneed to adapt to these harvested energy arrivals. In this paper, we consider\noptimization of point-to-point data transmission with an energy harvesting\ntransmitter which has a limited battery capacity, communicating in a wireless\nfading channel. We consider two objectives: maximizing the throughput by a\ndeadline, and minimizing the transmission completion time of the communication\nsession. We optimize these objectives by controlling the time sequence of\ntransmit powers subject to energy storage capacity and causality constraints.\nWe, first, study optimal offline policies. We introduce a directional\nwater-filling algorithm which provides a simple and concise interpretation of\nthe necessary optimality conditions. We show the optimality of an adaptive\ndirectional water-filling algorithm for the throughput maximization problem. We\nsolve the transmission completion time minimization problem by utilizing its\nequivalence to its throughput maximization counterpart. Next, we consider\nonline policies. We use stochastic dynamic programming to solve for the optimal\nonline policy that maximizes the average number of bits delivered by a deadline\nunder stochastic fading and energy arrival processes with causal channel state\nfeedback. We also propose near-optimal policies with reduced complexity, and\nnumerically study their performances along with the performances of the offline\nand online optimal policies under various different configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 16:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}

As part of a\nlarger study, we are using a 3D radiative hydrodynamics code to investigate how\nan embedded gas giant planet interacts with a gas disk that undergoes\ngravitational instabilities (GIs). This Letter presents results from\nsimulations with a Jupiter-mass planet placed in orbit at 25 AU within a 0.14\n$M_{\\odot}$ disk. The disk spans 5 to 40 AU around a 1 $M_{\\odot}$ star and is\ninitially marginally unstable. In one simulation, the planet is inserted prior\nto the eruption of GIs; in another, it is inserted only after the disk has\nsettled into a quasi-steady GI-active state, where heating by GIs roughly\nbalances radiative cooling. When the planet is present from the beginning, its\nown wake stimulates growth of a particular global mode with which it strongly\ninteracts, and the planet plunges inward six AU in about 10$^3$ years. In both\ncases with embedded planets, there are times when the planet's radial motion is\nslow and varies in direction. At other times, when the planet appears to be\ninteracting with strong spiral modes, migration both inward and outward can be\nrelatively rapid, covering several AUs over hundreds of years. Migration in\nboth cases appears to stall near the inner Lindblad resonance of a dominant\nlow-order mode. Planet orbit eccentricities fluctuate rapidly between about\n0.02 to 0.1 throughout the GI-active phases of the simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 18:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We now know that living cells take\nadvantage of stochasticity in some cases and counteract stochastic effects in\nothers. The source of intrinsic stochasticity in biomolecular systems are\nrandom timings of individual reactions, which cumulatively drive the\nvariability in outputs of such systems. Despite the acknowledged relevance of\nstochasticity in the functioning of living cells no rigorous method have been\nproposed to precisely identify sources of variability. In this paper we propose\na novel methodology that allows us to calculate contributions of individual\nreactions into the variability of a system's output. We demonstrate that some\nreactions have dramatically different effects on noise than others.\nSurprisingly, in the class of open conversion systems that serve as an\napproximate model of signal transduction, the degradation of an output\ncontributes half of the total noise. We also demonstrate the importance of\ndegradation in other relevant systems and propose a degradation feedback\ncontrol mechanism that has the capability of an effective noise suppression.\nApplication of our method to some well studied biochemical systems such as:\ngene expression, Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, and the p53 system indicates\nthat our methodology reveals an unprecedented insight into the origins of\nvariability in biochemical systems. For many systems an analytical\ndecomposition is not available; therefore the method has been implemented as a\nMatlab package and is available from the authors upon request.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 18:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}

However, the research is\nfocused on systems with only one type of links, connectivity links. We review a\nrecently developed mathematical framework for analyzing percolation properties\nof realistic scenarios of networks having links of two types, connectivity and\ndependency links. This formalism was applied to study\nErd$\\ddot{o}$s-R$\\acute{e}$nyi (ER) networks that include also dependency\nlinks. For an ER network with average degree $k$ that is composed of dependency\nclusters of size $s$, the fraction of nodes that belong to the giant component,\n$P_\\infty$, is given by $ P_\\infty=p^{s-1}[1-\\exp{(-kpP_\\infty)}]^s $ where\n$1-p$ is the initial fraction of randomly removed nodes. Here, we apply the\nformalism to the study of random-regular (RR) networks and find a formula for\nthe size of the giant component in the percolation process:\n$P_\\infty=p^{s-1}(1-r^k)^s$ where $r$ is the solution of\n$r=p^s(r^{k-1}-1)(1-r^k)+1$. These general results coincide, for $s=1$, with\nthe known equations for percolation in ER and RR networks respectively without\ndependency links. In contrast to $s=1$, where the percolation transition is\nsecond order, for $s>1$ it is of first order. Comparing the percolation\nbehavior of ER and RR networks we find a remarkable difference regarding their\nresilience. We show, analytically and numerically, that in ER networks with low\nconnectivity degree or large dependency clusters, removal of even a finite\nnumber (zero fraction) of the network nodes will trigger a cascade of failures\nthat fragments the whole network. This result is in contrast to RR networks\nwhere such cascades and full fragmentation can be triggered only by removal of\na finite fraction of nodes in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 19:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Finally, neutrinos from core collapse supernovae (SN)\nprovide another, qualitatively different probe of neutron rich matter.\nNeutrinos escape from the surface of last scattering known as the\nneutrino-sphere. This is a low density warm gas of neutron rich matter.\nObservations of neutrinos can probe nucleosyntheses in SN. Simulations of SN\ndepend on the equation of state (EOS) of neutron rich matter. We discuss a new\nEOS based on virial and relativistic mean field calculations. We believe that\ncombing astronomical observations using photos, GW, and neutrinos, with\nlaboratory experiments on nuclei, heavy ion collisions, and radioactive beams\nwill fundamentally advance our knowledge of compact objects in the heavens, the\ndense phases of QCD, the origin of the elements, and of neutron rich matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 20:22:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 15:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-17"}

It would provide spectroscopic access to the elementary\noptical excitations in matter on their natural length and time scales and\nenable applications from ultrafast nano-opto-electronics to single molecule\nquantum coherent control. Previous approaches have largely focused on using\nsurface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonant nanostructures or SPP waveguides to\ngenerate nanometer localized excitations. However, these implementations\ngenerally suffer from mode mismatch between the far-field propagating light and\nthe near-field confinement. In addition, the spatial localization in itself may\ndepend on the spectral phase and amplitude of the driving laser pulse thus\nlimiting the degrees of freedom available to independently control the\nnano-optical waveform. Here we utilize femtosecond broadband SPP coupling, by\nlaterally chirped fan gratings, onto the shaft of a monolithic noble metal tip,\nleading to adiabatic SPP compression and localization at the tip apex. In\ncombination with spectral pulse shaping with feedback on the intrinsic\nnonlinear response of the tip apex, we demonstrate the continuous micro- to\nnano-scale self-similar mode matched transformation of the propagating\nfemtosecond SPP field into a 20 nm spatially and 16 fs temporally confined\nlight pulse at the tip apex. Furthermore, with the essentially wavelength and\nphase independent 3D focusing mechanism we show the generation of arbitrary\noptical waveforms nanofocused at the tip.

It has been\nconditionally accepted by NOAO in response to a call for major new\ninstrumentation and a high-impact science program for the 4-m Mayall telescope\nat Kitt Peak. The BigBOSS instrument is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fed\nspectrograph capable of taking 5000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength\nrange from 340 nm to 1060 nm, with a resolution R = 3000-4800.\n  Using data from imaging surveys that are already underway, spectroscopic\ntargets are selected that trace the underlying dark matter distribution.

To probe the\nuniverse out to even higher redshift, BigBOSS will target bright [OII] emission\nline galaxies (ELGs) up to z = 1.7. In total, 20 million galaxy redshifts are\nobtained to measure the BAO feature, trace the matter power spectrum at smaller\nscales, and detect redshift space distortions.

Most of the neutron capture cross sections in the\ns-process have been measured and for an increasing number of reactions the\nrequired precision is achieved. This does not necessarily mean, however, that\nthe stellar rates are constrained equally well because only capture on the\nground state of a target is measured in the laboratory. Captures on excited\nstates can considerably contribute to stellar rates already at typical\ns-process temperatures. We show that the ground state contribution X to a\nstellar rate is the relevant measure to identify reactions which are or could\nbe well constrained by experiments and apply it to (n,gamma) reactions in the\ns-process. It is further shown that the maximally possible reduction in\nuncertainty of a rate through determination of the g.s. cross section is\ndirectly given by X.

However,\nthe choice of a short helical radiator leads to the problem of background\nsuppression. The driving idea of our proposal is that the background radiation\ncan be suppressed by spatial filtering. Slits can be inserted behind the APPLE\nII radiator, where the linearly-polarized radiation spot size is about 30 times\nlarger than the radiation spot size from the helical radiator. The last 7 cells\nof the SASE3 undulator are left with an open gap in order to provide a total 42\nm drift section for electron beam and radiation. The linearly-polarized\nradiation spot size increases along the drift, and the linearly polarized\nbackground radiation can be suppressed by the slits. At the same time, the\nmicrobunch structure is preserved. 100GW level coherent radiation is emitted in\nthe helical radiator. The filtering setup consists of a pair of water cooled\nslits for X-ray beam filtering and of a 5m-long magnetic chicane, creating an\noffset for slit installation immediately behind the helical radiator. Electrons\nand X-rays are separated before the slits by the chicane, and the electron beam\ncan pass by the filtering setup without perturbations. Based on start-to-end\nsimulations we present calculations from the SASE3 undulator entrance up to the\nradiator exit including the modulated electron beam transport by the FODO\nfocusing system in the low charge (20pC) mode of operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 11:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-10"}

This is due to the non-thermal jet\ncomponent which dominates the OIR moreso during hard X-ray states at high\nluminosities, and which is quenched in the soft state. The CMD therefore shows\nstate-dependent hysteresis, in analogy with (but not identical to) the well\nestablished X-ray hardness-intensity diagram of black hole transients.

Without such transfer, even if two tasks are\nvery similar at some abstract level, an extensive re-learning effort is\nrequired. The system achieves much of its power by transferring parts of\npreviously learned solutions rather than a single complete solution. The system\nexploits strong features in the multi-dimensional function produced by\nreinforcement learning in solving a particular task. These features are stable\nand easy to recognize early in the learning process. They generate a\npartitioning of the state space and thus the function. The partition is\nrepresented as a graph. This is used to index and compose functions stored in a\ncase base to form a close approximation to the solution of the new task.\nExperiments demonstrate that function composition often produces more than an\norder of magnitude increase in learning rate compared to a basic reinforcement\nlearning algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-10"}

The problem assumptions are:\nPR1) the performance of a general purpose planner should not be\npenalized/biased if executed on a sampling of problems and domains, PR2) minor\nsyntactic differences in representation do not affect performance, and PR3)\nproblems should be solvable by STRIPS capable planners unless they require ADL.\nThe planner assumptions are: PL1) the latest version of a planner is the best\none to use, PL2) default parameter settings approximate good performance, and\nPL3) time cut-offs do not unduly bias outcome.

Of\nparticular note is the trans-Planckian problem, which is concerned with the\napparent origin of the radiation in absurdly high frequencies. In order to gain\nbetter theoretical understanding and, it is hoped, experimental verification of\nHawking radiation, much study is being devoted to systems which model the\nspacetime geometry of black holes, and which, by analogy, are also thought to\nemit Hawking radiation. These analogue systems typically exhibit dispersion,\nwhich regularizes the wave behaviour at the horizon but does not lend itself\nwell to analytic treatment, thus rendering Hawking's prediction less secure. A\ngeneral analytic method for dealing with Hawking radiation in dispersive\nsystems has proved difficult to find.\n  This thesis presents new numerical and analytic results for Hawking emission\nspectra in dispersive systems. It examines two black-hole analogue systems: it\nbegins by introducing the well-known acoustic model, presenting some original\nresults in that context; then, through analogy with the acoustic model, goes on\nto develop the lesser-known fibre-optical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-10"}

A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not\napproximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately\ncomposed of \"normal\" examples with only a small percentage of \"abnormal\" or\n\"interesting\" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an\nabnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than\nthe cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class\nhas been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier\nto the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of\nover-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority\n(normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than\nonly under-sampling the majority class.

However,\nin monitoring deployed teams, we often cannot rely on the agents to always\ncommunicate their state to the monitoring system. This paper presents a\nnon-intrusive approach to monitoring by 'overhearing', where the monitored\nteam's state is inferred (via plan-recognition) from team-members' routine\ncommunications, exchanged as part of their coordinated task execution, and\nobserved (overheard) by the monitoring system. Key challenges in this approach\ninclude the demanding run-time requirements of monitoring, the scarceness of\nobservations (increasing monitoring uncertainty), and the need to scale-up\nmonitoring to address potentially large teams. To address these, we present a\nset of complementary novel techniques, exploiting knowledge of the social\nstructures and procedures in the monitored team: (i) an efficient probabilistic\nplan-recognition algorithm, well-suited for processing communications as\nobservations; (ii) an approach to exploiting knowledge of the team's social\nbehavior to predict future observations during execution (reducing monitoring\nuncertainty); and (iii) monitoring algorithms that trade expressivity for\nscalability, representing only certain useful monitoring hypotheses, but\nallowing for any number of agents and their different activities to be\nrepresented in a single coherent entity. We present an empirical evaluation of\nthese techniques, in combination and apart, in monitoring a deployed team of\nagents, running on machines physically distributed across the country, and\nengaged in complex, dynamic task execution. We also compare the performance of\nthese techniques to human expert and novice monitors, and show that the\ntechniques presented are capable of monitoring at human-expert levels, despite\nthe difficulty of the task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-10"}

The particular problem domain we\nexplore is the control of network routing by placing agents on all the routers\nin the network. Conventional approaches to this task have the agents all use\nthe Ideal Shortest Path routing Algorithm (ISPA). We demonstrate that in many\ncases, due to the side-effects of one agent's actions on another agent's\nperformance, having agents use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global aggregate\ncost is concerned, even when they are only used to route infinitesimally small\namounts of traffic. The utility functions of the individual agents are not\n\"aligned\" with the global utility, intuitively speaking. As a particular\nexample of this we present an instance of Braess' paradox in which adding new\nlinks to a network whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in\noverall throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the\nagents' decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost incurred by\nall traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost\naveraged across time is concerned. This is also due to 'side-effects', in this\ncase of current routing decision on future traffic. The mathematics of\nCollective Intelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the issue of\navoiding such deleterious side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time\nand space. We present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive\nan algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that of\nhaving all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We present\nexperiments verifying this, and also showing that a machine-learning-based\nversion of this COIN algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated\nvia empirical means (a version potentially applicable in the real world) also\noutperforms the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the\nISPA.

Factored MDPs represent a complex state space\nusing state variables and the transition model using a dynamic Bayesian\nnetwork. This representation often allows an exponential reduction in the\nrepresentation size of structured MDPs, but the complexity of exact solution\nalgorithms for such MDPs can grow exponentially in the representation size. In\nthis paper, we present two approximate solution algorithms that exploit\nstructure in factored MDPs. Both use an approximate value function represented\nas a linear combination of basis functions, where each basis function involves\nonly a small subset of the domain variables. A key contribution of this paper\nis that it shows how the basic operations of both algorithms can be performed\nefficiently in closed form, by exploiting both additive and context-specific\nstructure in a factored MDP. A central element of our algorithms is a novel\nlinear program decomposition technique, analogous to variable elimination in\nBayesian networks, which reduces an exponentially large LP to a provably\nequivalent, polynomial-sized one. One algorithm uses approximate linear\nprogramming, and the second approximate dynamic programming. Our dynamic\nprogramming algorithm is novel in that it uses an approximation based on\nmax-norm, a technique that more directly minimizes the terms that appear in\nerror bounds for approximate MDP algorithms. We provide experimental results on\nproblems with over 10^40 states, demonstrating a promising indication of the\nscalability of our approach, and compare our algorithm to an existing\nstate-of-the-art approach, showing, in some problems, exponential gains in\ncomputation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-10"}

Independently of any probabilistic consideration a certain\nmultivariable version of the Gelfand-Aomoto hypergeometric function was\nconsidered in papers by H. Mizukawa and H. Tanaka.

It is shown that in the low frequency limit multiple\nscattering allows us to define frequency-dependent effective acoustic\nparameters for arrays of both ordered and disordered cylinders. This\nformulation can lead to both positive and negative acoustic parameters, where\nthe acoustic parameters are the scalar bulk modulus and the tensorial mass\ndensity and, therefore, anisotropic wave propagation is allowed with both\npositive or negative refraction index. It is also shown that the surface fields\non the scatterer are the main responsible of the anomalous behavior of the\neffective medium, therefore complex scatterers can be used to engineer the\nfrequency response of the effective medium, and some examples of application to\ndifferent scatterers are given. Finally, the theory is extended to\nelectromagnetic wave propagation, where Mie resonances are found to be the\nresponsible of the metamaterial behavior. As an application, it is shown that\nit is possible to obtain metamaterials with negative permeability and\npermittivity tensors by arrays of all-dielectric cylinders and that anisotropic\ncylinders can tune the frequency response of these resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 15:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

An analogy to an electrostatic problem is established,\nwhereby the density profile induced by a driving bond maps onto the\nelectrostatic potential due to an electric dipole located along the bond. The\ndipole strength is proportional to the drive, and is determined\nself-consistently by solving the electrostatic problem. The profile resulting\nfrom a localized configuration of more than one driving bond can be\nstraightforwardly determined by the superposition principle of electrostatics.\nThis picture is shown to hold even in the presence of exclusion interaction\nbetween particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 15:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 17:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
