One proposal to address this puzzle at the semi-classical\nlevel is to decouple quantum vacuum from space-time geometry via a modification\nof gravity that includes an incompressible fluid, known as Gravitational\nAether. In this paper, we discuss classical predictions of this theory along\nwith its compatibility with cosmological and experimental tests of gravity. We\nargue that deviations from General Relativity (GR) in this theory are sourced\nby pressure or vorticity. In particular, the theory predicts that the\ngravitational constant for radiation is 33% larger than that of\nnon-relativistic matter, which is preferred by (most) cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB), Lyman-Alpha forest, and Lithium-7 primordial abundance\nobservations, while being consistent with other cosmological tests at ~2-sigma\nlevel. It is further shown that all Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN)\nparameters have the standard GR values aside from the anomalous coupling to\npressure, which has not been directly measured. A more subtle prediction of\nthis model (assuming irrotational aether) is that the (intrinsic)\ngravitomagnetic effect is 33% larger than GR prediction. This is consistent\nwith current limits from LAGEOS and Gravity Probe B at ~2-sigma level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 16:09:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 15:55:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 03:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-02"}

A\nmicroscopic theory is developed, starting with a crystal lattice, setting up a\nBCS-like Hamiltonian in terms of composite bosons, and using statistical\nmechanical method. The main advantage of our bosonic theory is its capability\nof explaning the plateau formation in the Hall resistivity, which is assumed in\nthe composite fermion theories. In the QHE under radiation, the resistivity\nvanishes within a range with no plateau formation. This is shown in terms of\ntwo-channels model, one channel excited by radiation where the supercurrents\nrun and the other (base) channel in which the normal currents run. The\ntransport diamonds (TD) and the zero direct current anomaly (ZCA) occur when\nthe resistivity $r$ is measured as a function of magnetic field and direct\ncurrent (DC). The spiral motion of an electron under a magnetic field can be\ndecomposed into two, the cyclotron motion with the cyclotron mass $m^*$ and the\nguiding center motion with the magnetotransport $M^*$. The quantization of the\nmotion generates magnetic oscillations in the density of states. The\nmagnetoconductivity is calculated, using kinetic theory and quantum statistical\nmechanics. The TR and ZCA are shown to be a breakdown of QHE. The integer QHE\nminima are shown to become the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) maxima progressively as\nthe DC increases.

We collect and\nexploit these data in order to measure from the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) precisely how much stellar radiation is intercepted and re-radiated by\ndust, and how this quantity varies with galaxy properties. By including SPIRE\ndata, we are more sensitive to emission from cold dust grains than previous\nanalyses at shorter wavelengths, allowing for more accurate estimates of dust\ntemperatures and masses.\n  The dust/stellar flux ratio, which we measure by integrating the SEDs, has a\nrange of nearly three decades. The inclusion of SPIRE data shows that estimates\nbased on data not reaching these far-IR wavelengths are biased low. We find\nthat the dust/stellar flux ratio varies with morphology and total IR\nluminosity. We also find that dust/stellar flux ratios are related to gas-phase\nmetallicity, while the dust/stellar mass ratios are less so. The substantial\nscatter between dust/stellar flux and dust/stellar mass indicates that the\nformer is a poor proxy of the latter. Comparing the dust/stellar flux ratios\nand dust temperatures, we show that early-types tend to have slightly warmer\ntemperatures than spiral galaxies, which may be due to more intense\ninterstellar radiation fields, or to different dust grain compositions.\nFinally, we show that early-types and early-type spirals have a strong\ncorrelation between the dust/stellar flux ratio and specific star formation\nrate, which suggests that the relatively bright far-IR emission of some of\nthese galaxies is due to ongoing star formation and the radiation field from\nolder stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 20:03:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 03:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We compute the time rate of change of axial\ncharge and of energy both in field theory and from holography, with perfect\nagreement.

These\nresults are based on spectral fits to all the long exposure observations of APM\n08279+5255 using a new quasar-outflow model. This model is based on cloudy\nsimulations of a near-relativistic quasar outflow. The main conclusions from\nour multi-epoch spectral re-analysis of Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku\nobservations of APM 08279+5255 are: 1) In every observation we confirm the\npresence of two strong features, one at rest-frame energies between 1-4 keV,\nand the other between 7-18 keV. 2) We confirm that the low-energy absorption\n(1-4 keV rest-frame) arises from a low-ionization absorber with logNH~23 and\nthe high-energy absorption (7-18 keV rest-frame) arises from highly ionized\n(3>log xi>4; where xi is the ionization parameter) iron in a near-relativistic\noutflowing wind. Assuming this interpretation, we find that the velocities on\nthe outflow could get up to ~0.7c. 3) We confirm a correlation between the\nmaximum outflow velocity and the photon index and find possible trends between\nthe maximum outflow velocity and the X-ray luminosity, and between the total\ncolumn density and the photon index. We performed calculations of the force\nmultipliers of material illuminated by absorbed power laws and a\nMathews-Ferland SED. We found that variations of the X-ray and UV parts of the\nSEDs and the presence of a moderate absorbing shield will produce important\nchanges in the strength of the radiative driving force. These results support\nthe observed trend found between the outflow velocity and X-ray photon index in\nAPM 08279+5255. If this result is confirmed it will imply that radiation\npressure is an important mechanism in producing quasar outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 20:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The main addition in this work is that for the CMB data\nset, we explicitly include the angular power spectra C_l for TT, TE and EE\nmodes in our analysis which seem to contain somewhat more information than\ntaking the electron scattering optical depth tau_{el} as a single data point.\nUsing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we find that all the quantities related\nto reionization can be severely constrained at z < 6 whereas a broad range of\nreionization histories at z > 6 are still permitted by the current data sets.\nWith currently available data from WMAP7, we constrain 0.080 < tau_{el} < 0.112\n(95% CL) and also conclude that reionization is 50% complete between 9.0 <\nz(Q_{HII} = 0.5) < 11.8 (95% CL) and is 99% complete between 5.8 < z(Q_{HII} =\n0.99) < 10.4 (95% CL). With the forthcoming PLANCK data on large-scale\npolarization (ignoring effect of foregrounds), the z > 6 constraints will be\nimproved considerably, e.g., the 2-sigma error on tau_{el} will be reduced to\n0.009 and the uncertainties on z(Q_{HII} = 0.5) and z(Q_{HII} = 0.99) would be\n\\sim 1 and 3 (95% CL), respectively.

However, the formation of planets in inclined binary\nsystems poses a considerable theoretical challenge, as orbital excitation due\nto the Kozai resonance implies destructive, high-velocity collisions among\nplanetesimals. To resolve the apparent difficulties posed by Kozai resonance,\nwe seek to identify the primary physical processes responsible for inhibiting\nthe action of Kozai cycles in protoplanetary disks. Subsequently, we seek to\nunderstand how newly-formed planetary systems transition to their observed,\nKozai-dominated dynamical states. We find that theoretical difficulties in\nplanet formation arising from the presence of a distant companion star, posed\nby the Kozai effect and other secular perturbations, can be overcome by a\nproper account of gravitational interactions within the protoplanetary disk. In\nparticular, fast apsidal recession induced by disk self-gravity tends to erase\nthe Kozai effect, and ensure that the disk's unwarped, rigid structure is\nmaintained. Subsequently, once a planetary system has formed, the Kozai effect\ncan continue to be wiped out as a result of apsidal precession, arising from\nplanet-planet interactions. However, if such a system undergoes a dynamical\ninstability, its architecture may change in such a way that the Kozai effect\nbecomes operative. The results presented here suggest that planetary formation\nin highly inclined binary systems is not stalled by perturbations, arising from\nthe stellar companion. Consequently, planet formation in binary stars is\nprobably no different from that around single stars on a qualitative level.\nFurthermore, it is likely that systems where the Kozai effect operates,\nunderwent a transient phase of dynamical instability in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 21:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Sharir, Pnueli and Hart [SIAM J.\nComput. 13(1984)292-314] presented a general method for proving properties of\nprobabilistic programs, in which a probabilistic program is modeled by a Markov\nchain and an assertion on the output distribution is extended into an invariant\nassertion on all intermediate distributions. Their method is essentially a\nprobabilistic generalization of the classical Floyd inductive assertion method.\nIn this paper, we consider quantum programs modeled by quantum Markov chains\nwhich are defined by super-operators. It is shown that the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart\nmethod can be elegantly generalized to quantum programs by exploiting the\nSchr\\\"odinger-Heisenberg duality between quantum states and observables. In\nparticular, a completeness theorem for the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart verification\nmethod of quantum programs is established. 2. As indicated by the completeness\ntheorem, the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method is in principle effective for verifying\nall properties of quantum programs that can be expressed in terms of Hermitian\noperators (observables). But it is not feasible for many practical applications\nbecause of the complicated calculation involved in the verification. For the\ncase of finite-dimensional state spaces, we find a method for verification of\nquantum programs much simpler than the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method by employing\nthe matrix representation of super-operators and Jordan decomposition of\nmatrices. In particular, this method enables us to compute easily the average\nrunning time and even to analyze some interesting long-run behaviors of quantum\nprograms in a finite-dimensional state space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 00:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-22"}

A manifold is n-plectic if it is equipped with a closed,\nnondegenerate form of degree n+1. We show that higher structures arise on these\nmanifolds which can be understood as the categorified or homotopy analogues of\nimportant structures studied in symplectic geometry and geometric quantization.\nJust as a symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, we show\nthat any n-plectic manifold gives a Lie n-algebra containing certain\ndifferential forms which we call Hamiltonian. Lie n-algebras are examples of\nstrongly homotopy Lie algebras. They consist of an n-term chain complex\nequipped with a collection of skew-symmetric multi-brackets that satisfy a\ngeneralized Jacobi identity. We then develop the machinery necessary to\ngeometrically quantize n-plectic manifolds. In particular, just as a\nprequantized symplectic manifold is equipped with a principal U(1)-bundle with\nconnection, a prequantized 2-plectic manifold is equipped with a U(1)-gerbe\nwith 2-connection. A gerbe is a categorified sheaf, or stack, which generalizes\nthe notion of a principal bundle. Furthermore, over any 2-plectic manifold\nthere is a vector bundle equipped with extra structure called a Courant\nalgebroid. This bundle is the 2-plectic analogue of the Atiyah algebroid over a\nprequantized symplectic manifold. Its space of global sections also forms a Lie\n2-algebra, which we use to prequantize the Lie 2-algebra of Hamiltonian forms.\nFinally, we introduce the 2-plectic analogue of the Bohr-Sommerfeld variety\nassociated to a real polarization, and use this to geometrically quantize\n2-plectic manifolds.

Non-magnetic anvils made of composite ceramic material were used\nto generate high-pressure with a Cu-Be gasket. We have examined anvils with\ndifferent culet sizes (1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, 1.0, 0.8 and 0.6 mm). The pressure\ngenerated at low temperature was determined by the pressure dependence of the\nsuperconducting transition of lead (Pb). The maximum pressure $P_{max}$ depends\non the culet size of the anvil: the values of $P_{max}$ are 2.4 and 7.6 GPa for\n1.8 and 0.6 mm culet anvils, respectively. We revealed that the composite\nceramic anvil has potential to generate high pressure above 5 GPa. The\nbackground magnetization of the Cu-Be gasket is generally two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the Ni-Cr-Al gasket for the indenter cell. The present\ncell can be used not only with ferromagnetic and superconducting materials with\nlarge magnetization but also with antiferromagnetic compounds with smaller\nmagnetization. The production cost of the present pressure cell is about one\ntenth of that of a diamond anvil cell. The anvil alignment mechanism is not\nnecessary in the present pressure cell because of the strong fracture toughness\n(6.5 MPa${\\cdot}$m$^{1/2}$) of the composite ceramic anvil. The simplified\npressure cell is easy-to-use for researchers who are not familiar with high\npressure technology.

Due to\npotentially large amplitude of electric fields within these structures, their\neffects on particle heating, scattering, or acceleration can be important. One\npossible theoretical description of some of these structures is the concept of\nBernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes, which are exact nonlinear solutions of\nthe Vlasov-Poisson system of equations in collisionless kinetic theory. BGK\nmodes have been studied extensively for many decades, predominately in one\ndimension (1D), although there have been observations showing that some of\nthese structures have clear 3D features.

The novelty of the proposed methods is to use complex penalty\nparameters with positive imaginary parts. It is proved that, if the penalty\nparameter is a pure imaginary number $\\i\\ga$ with $0<\\ga\\le C$, then the\nproposed CIP-FEM is stable (hence well-posed) without any mesh constraint.\nMoreover the method satisfies the error estimates $C_1kh+C_2k^3h^2$ in the\n$H^1$-norm when $k^3h^2\\le C_0$ and $C_1kh+\\frac{C_2}{\\ga}$ when $k^3h^2> C_0$\nand $kh$ is bounded, where $k$ is the wave number, $h$ is the mesh size, and\nthe $C$'s are positive constants independent of $k$, $h$, and $\\ga$.

The\ndifferential rotation and meridional circulation are intimately linked, with a\ncommon origin in the turbulent stresses of the upper solar convection zone. The\nexistence and structure of the NSSL cannot be attributed to the conservation of\nangular momentum by solar surface convection, as is often supposed. Rather, the\nturbulent angular momentum transport accounts for the poleward meridional flow\nwhile the often overlooked meridional force balance maintains the mid-latitude\nrotational shear. We suggest that the base of the NSSL is marked by a\ntransition from baroclinic to turbulent stresses in the meridional plane which\nsuppress Coriolis-induced circulations that would otherwise establish a\ncylindrical rotation profile. The turbulent angular momentum transport must be\nnon-diffusive and directed radially inward. Inferred mean flows are consistent\nwith the idea that turbulent convection tends to mix angular momentum but only\nif the mixing efficiency is inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic. The latitudinal\nand longitudinal components of the estimated turbulent transport are comparable\nin amplitude and about an order of magnitude larger than the vertical\ncomponent. We estimate that it requires 2--4% of the solar luminosity to\nmaintain the solar NSSL against the inertia of the mean flow.

The spatial\nresolution of the resultant map is 19\".3, corresponding to 81 pc, which is\nsufficient to identify each Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) in the disk. We found\nclumpy structures with a typical spatial scale of ~100 pc, corresponding to\nGMCs, and no diffuse, smoothly distributed component of molecular gas at this\nsensitivity. Closer inspection of the CO and HI maps suggests that not every CO\nemission is associated with local HI peaks, particularly in the inner portion\nof the disk (r < 2 kpc), although most of CO emission is located at the local\nHI peaks in the outer radii. We found that most uncovered GMCs are accompanied\nby massive star-forming regions, although the star formation rates (SFRs) vary\nwidely from cloud to cloud. The azimuthally averaged H{\\sc i} gas surface\ndensity exhibits a flat radial distribution. However, the CO radial\ndistribution shows a significant enhancement within the central 1-2 kpc region,\nwhich is very similar to that of the SFR. We obtained a map of the molecular\nfraction, f_mol = Sigma_H_2/(Sigma_HI+Sigma_H_2, at a 100-pc resolution. This\nis the first f_mol map covering an entire galaxy with a GMC-scale resolution.\nWe find that f_mol tends to be high near the center. The correlation between\nf_mol and gas surface density shows two distinct sequences. The presence of two\ncorrelation sequences can be explained by differences in metallicity, i.e.,\nhigher (~ 2-fold) metallicity in the central region (r< 1.5 kpc) than in the\nouter parts. Alternatively, differences in scale height can also account for\nthe two sequences, i.e., increased scale height toward the outer disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 07:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We\npresent new long-baseline spectro-interferometric observations of the HerbigAe\nstar, HR5999, obtained in the H and K bands with the AMBER instrument at the\nVLTI, and aim to produce near-infrared images at the sub-AU spatial scale. We\nspatially resolve the circumstellar material and reconstruct images using the\nMiRA algorithm. In addition, we interpret the interferometric observations\nusing models that assume that the near-infrared excess is dominated by the\nemission of a circumstellar disk. We compare the images reconstructed from the\nVLTI measurements to images obtained using simulated model data. The K-band\nimage reveals three main elements: a ring-like feature located at ~0.65 AU, a\nlow surface brightness region inside, and a central spot. At the maximum\nangular resolution of our observations (1.3 mas), the ring is resolved while\nthe central spot is only marginally resolved, preventing us from revealing the\nexact morphology of the circumstellar environment. We suggest that the ring\ntraces silicate condensation, i.e., an opacity change, in a circumstellar disk\naround HR 5999. We build a model that includes a ring at the silicate\nsublimation radius and an inner disk of low surface brightness responsible for\na large amount of the near-infrared continuum emission. The model successfully\nfits the SED, visibilities, and closure phases, and provides evidence of a low\nsurface brightness region inside the silicate sublimation radius. This study\nprovides additional evidence that in HerbigAe stars, there is material in a low\nsurface brightness region, probably a low optical depth region, located inside\nthe silicate sublimation radius and of unknown nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 09:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-22"}

Most of these studies have been carried out in vacuum and\nvery many fewer studies have been carried out in air. Recently this lack has\nbeen partially addressed with the development of femtosecond laser\nmicromachining. Another similar although apparently unconnected field (B) deals\nwith the channelling of high power laser beam in filaments after passage\nthrough long distances in air. This has been largely driven by the construction\nof a mobile terawatt laser beam (Teramobile) for atmospheric studies. The laser\nbeams in these two cases (A and B) have very different pulse energies (mJ\nagainst J) although the filaments in (B) have similar energies to (A) and are\nclamped at intensities less than 1014 Wcm-2. This paper has been written to\ncompare the production of hard X-rays in these two cases. The conclusion is\ninteresting that a focused sub TW laser pulse in air reaches intensities\nsufficiently high that characteristic K and L X-rays are generated from a\nnumber of metal and non metal targets as well as a continuous bremsstrahlung\nspectrum. On the other hand the clamping of the multi-filaments in a 100 TW\nlaser beam in air cannot generate hard Xrays especially when propagated over\nlong distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 09:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-22"}

Finding out a proper\nU(1) symmetry becomes a crucial point.

We investigate the theoretical basis of\nthis novel tool, using a generic model. In particular, we study the length\ndependence of the conducting frontier orbital and of the 'transition voltage'\nas a function of length. We show that this dependence is influenced by the\namount of screening of the electrons in the molecule, which determines the\nvoltage drop to be located at the contacts or across the entire molecule. We\nobserve that the transition voltage depends significantly on the length, but\nthat the ratio between the transition voltage and the conducting frontier\norbital is approximately constant only in strongly screening (conjugated)\nmolecules. Uncertainty about the screening within a molecule thus limits the\npredictive power of TVS. We furthermore argue that the relative length\nindependence of the transition voltage for non-conjugated chains is due to\nstrong localization of the frontier orbitals on the end groups ensuring binding\nof the rods to the metallic contacts. Finally, we investigate the\ncharacteristics of TVS in asymmetric molecular junctions. If a single level\ndominates the transport properties, TVS can provide a good estimate for both\nthe level position and the degree of junction asymmetry. If more levels are\ninvolved the applicability of TVS becomes limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 09:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-09"}

A classical example is the R-parity of\nthe MSSM, which guarantees the absence of dimension four baryon- and\nlepton-number violating operators. Although phenomenologically useful, these\ndiscrete symmetries are, in the context of field theory, poorly motivated at a\nmore fundamental level. Moreover, discrete {\\em global} symmetries are expected\nto be violated in consistent couplings to quantum gravity, while their {\\em\ngauged} versions are expected to actually exist. In this paper we study\ndiscrete gauge symmetries in brane models in string theory, and argue that they\nare fairly generic in this framework. In particular we study the appearance of\ndiscrete gauge symmetries in (MS)SM brane constructions in string theory, and\nshow that a few discrete ${Z_N}$ gauge symmetries, including R-parity and {\\it\nbaryon triality}, appear naturally as remnants of continuous U(1) gauge\nsymmetries with St\\\"uckelberg $N(B\\wedge F)$ couplings.

Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc. Both processes are powered by the\naction of magnetic fields and are, in turn, likely to strongly affect the\nstructure, dynamics, evolutionary path and planet-forming capabilities of their\nhost discs. The weak ionisation of protostellar discs, however, may prevent the\nmagnetic field from effectively coupling to the gas and shear and driving these\nprocesses. Here I examine the viability and properties of these\nmagnetically-driven processes in protostellar discs. The results indicate that,\ndespite the weak ionisation, the magnetic field is able to couple to the gas\nand shear for fluid conditions thought to be satisfied over a wide range of\nradii in these discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 11:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The paper first details the choice of materials,\nfabrication and characterisation of electrodes and a separator layer. Then the\nbattery is assembled and characterised, and finally, a large battery sample\nmade of several long strips is woven into a textile, connectorized with\nconductive threads, and characterised. Within this paper, there are two\npractical aspects of battery design that we have investigated in details: first\nis making composites of cathode/anode material with optimized ratio of\nconducting carbon and polymer binder material, and second is battery\nperformance including cycling, reversibility, and compatibility of the\ncathode/anode materials. Finally, when casting electrodes and separator layer\nwe mostly focused on using aqueous solutions instead of organic solvents in\norder to make the fabrication process environmentally friendly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 12:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 14:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

The telescope network enables us to observe the targets\ncontinuously for several days in order not to miss any transit. The runs are\ntypically one to two weeks long, about three runs per year per cluster in two\nor three subsequent years for about ten clusters. There are thousands of stars\ndetectable in each field with several hundred known cluster members, e.g. in\nthe first cluster observed, Tr-37, a typical cluster for the YETI survey, there\nare at least 469 known young stars detected in YETI data down to R=16.5 mag\nwith sufficient precision of 50 milli-mag rms (5 mmag rms down to R=14.5 mag)\nto detect transits, so that we can expect at least about one young transiting\nobject in this cluster. If we observe 10 similar clusters, we can expect to\ndetect approximately 10 young transiting planets with radius determinations.\nThe precision given above is for a typical telescope of the YETI network,\nnamely the 60/90-cm Jena telescope (similar brightness limit, namely within\n+/-1 mag, for the others) so that planetary transits can be detected. For\nplanets with mass and radius determinations, we can calculate the mean density\nand probe the internal structure. We aim to constrain planet formation models\nand their time-scales by discovering planets younger than 100 Myr and\ndetermining not only their orbital parameters, but also measuring their true\nmasses and radii, which is possible so far only by the transit method. Here, we\npresent an overview and first results. (Abstract shortened)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 15:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
