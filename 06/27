However,\nunary operator domains induce a natural structure, called the domain's causal\ngraph. This graph relates between the preconditions and effect of each domain\noperator. Causal graphs were exploited by Williams and Nayak in order to\nanalyze plan generation for one of the controllers in NASA's Deep-Space One\nspacecraft.

In terms of parallel performance, weak scaling results show the fmm-based\nvortex method achieving 74% parallel efficiency on 4096 processes (one gpu per\nmpi process, 3 gpus per node of the TSUBAME-2.0 system). The FFT-based spectral\nmethod is able to achieve just 14% parallel efficiency on the same number of\nmpi processes (using only cpu cores), due to the all-to-all communication\npattern of the FFT algorithm. The calculation time for one time step was 108\nseconds for the vortex method and 154 seconds for the spectral method, under\nthese conditions. Computing with 69 billion particles, this work exceeds by an\norder of magnitude the largest vortex method calculations to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2011 22:05:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 18:47:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 19:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-30"}

The definitions of\n$\\epsilon$-interleavings and $d_I$ generalize readily to multidimensional\npersistence modules. In this paper, we develop the theory of multidimensional\ninterleavings, with a view towards applications to topological data analysis.\nWe present four main results.

This result, which first\nappeared in an earlier preprint of this paper, has since appeared in several\nother places, and is now known as the isometry theorem. Second, we present a\ncharacterization of the $\\epsilon$-interleaving relation on multidimensional\npersistence modules. This expresses transparently the sense in which two\n$\\epsilon$-interleaved modules are algebraically similar. Third, using this\ncharacterization, we show that when we define our persistence modules over a\nprime field, $d_I$ satisfies a universality property. This universality result\nis the central result of the paper. It says that $d_I$ satisfies a stability\nproperty generalizing one which $d_B$ is known to satisfy, and that in\naddition, if $d$ is any other pseudometric on multidimensional persistence\nmodules satisfying the same stability property, then $d\\leq d_I$.

The Meissner effect is well\nknown but, I argue, not explained by the conventional theory, the Spin Meissner\neffect has yet to be detected. I propose that both effects take place in all\nsuperconductors, the first one in the presence of an applied magnetostatic\nfield, the second one even in the absence of applied external fields. Both\neffects can be understood under the assumption that electrons expand their\norbits and thereby lower their quantum kinetic energy in the transition to\nsuperconductivity. Associated with this process, the metal expels negative\ncharge from the interior to the surface and an electric field is generated in\nthe interior. The resulting charge current can be understood as arising from\nthe magnetic Lorentz force on radially outgoing electrons, and the resulting\nspin current can be understood as arising from a spin Hall effect originating\nin the Rashba-like coupling of the electron magnetic moment to the internal\nelectric field. The associated electrodynamics is qualitatively different from\nLondon electrodynamics, yet can be described by a small modification of the\nconventional London equations. The stability of the superconducting state and\nits macroscopic phase coherence hinge on the fact that the orbital angular\nmomentum of the carriers of the spin current is found to be exactly $\\hbar/2$,\nindicating a topological origin. The simplicity and universality of our theory\nargue for its validity, and the occurrence of superconductivity in many classes\nof materials can be understood within our theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 06:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-23"}

In previous theoretical studies the enhanced\nmass loss of these stars has been attributed to their proximity to the\nEddington limit. Here we investigate observed trends in the mass-loss\nproperties of such young, very massive stars. We derive theoretical\nmass-luminosity relations for very massive stars, based on a large grid of\nstellar structure models. Using these relations, we estimate Eddington factors\nfor a sample of stars, under different assumptions of their evolutionary\nstatus. We evaluate the resulting mass-loss relations, and compare them with\ntheoretical predictions. We find observational evidence that the mass loss in\nthe WR regime is dominated by the Eddington parameter Gamma_e, which has\nimportant consequences for the way we understand Wolf-Rayet stars and their\nmass loss. In addition, we derive wind masses that support the picture that the\nWNh stars in young stellar clusters are very massive, hydrogen-burning stars.\nOur findings suggest that the proximity to the Eddington limit is the physical\nreason for the onset of Wolf-Rayet type mass loss. This means that, e.g. in\nstellar evolution models, the Wolf-Rayet stage should be identified by large\nEddington parameters, instead of a helium-enriched surface composition. The\nlatter is most likely only a consequence of strong mass loss, in combination\nwith internal mixing. For very massive stars, the enhanced Gamma-dependent mass\nloss is responsible for the formation of late WNh subtypes with high hydrogen\nsurface abundances, partly close to solar. Because mass loss dominates the\nevolution of very massive stars, we expect a strong impact of this effect on\ntheir end products, in particular on the potential formation of black holes,\nand Gamma-Ray Bursts, as well as the observed upper mass limit of stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 11:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Each transmitter has M antennas and\ntransmits L independent data streams to the desired receiver with N receive\nantennas. We focus on the case where not all K-1 interfering transmitters can\nbe aligned at every receiver. As a result, there will be residual interference\nat each receiver that cannot be aligned. Each receiver detects and cancels the\nresidual interference based on the constellation map. However, there is a\nwindow of unfavorable interference profile at the receiver for Interference\nDetection (ID). In this paper, we propose a low complexity Partial Interference\nAlignment scheme in which we dynamically select the user set for IA so as to\ncreate a favorable interference profile for ID at each receiver. We first\nderive the average symbol error rate (SER) by taking into account of the\nnon-Guassian residual interference due to discrete constellation. Using graph\ntheory, we then devise a low complexity user set selection algorithm for the\nPIAID scheme,which minimizes the asymptotically tight bound for the average\nend-to-end SER performance. Moreover, we substantially simplify interference\ndetection at the receiver using Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR) techniques. It\nis shown that the SER performance of the proposed PIAID scheme has significant\ngain compared with various conventional baseline solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 11:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

CO fundamental emission is a potentially powerful probe of\nthe disk/wind structure within a few AU of young protostars. In this paper, we\npresent high spectral (R=90,000) and spatial (0.3\") resolution VLT/CRIRES\nM-band spectra of 18 low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) with dense envelopes\nin nearby star-froming regions to explore the utility of CO fundamental 4.6\nmicron emission as a probe of very young disks. CO fundamental emission is\ndetected from 14 of the YSOs in our sample. The emission line profiles show a\nrange of strengths and shapes, but can generally be classified into a broad,\nwarm component and a narrow, cool component. The broad CO emission is detected\nmore frequently from YSOs with bolometric luminosities of <15 Lsun than those\nwith >15 Lsun, and as with CO emission from CTTSs is attributed to the warm\n(~1000 K) inner AU of the disk. The CO emission from objects with high\nbolometric luminosity is produced in cooler (~320 K), narrow lines in 12CO and\nin rarer isotopologues. From some objects, the narrow lines are blueshifted by\nup to ~10 km/s, indicating a slow wind origin. For other sources the lines are\nlocated at the systemic velocity of the star and likely arise in the disk. For\na few YSOs, spatially-extended CO and H2 S(9) emission is detected up to 2\"\nfrom the central source and is attributed to interactions between the wind and\nsurrounding molecular material. Warm CO absorption is detected in the wind of\nsix objects with velocities up to 100 km/s, often in discrete velocity\ncomponents. That the wind is partially molecular where it is launched favors\nejection in a disk wind rather than a coronal or chromospheric wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 13:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The problem\nconsists of an ordinary differential wave equation with periodic coefficients,\nwhich involves two free parameters $\\omega $ (the frequency) and $k$ (the\nwavenumber in the direction orthogonal to the axis of periodicity). Solutions\nof this equation satisfy a quasi-periodic boundary condition which yields the\nFloquet parameter $K$. The resulting dispersion surface $\\omega (K,k)$ may be\ncharacterized through its cuts at constant values of $K, k$ and $\\omega $ that\ndefine the passband (real $K$) and stopband areas, the Floquet branches and the\nisofrequency curves, respectively.

We find that in water the inter-micellar\nexchange of these block copolymers is very slow so that the self-assembled\nstructures are in local but not global equilibrium (i.e., they are\nnon-ergodic). This opens up the possibility of controlling micelle morphology\nboth thermodynamically and kinetically. Specifically, when the two species are\nfirst dissolved in THF before mixing and self-assembly (`premixing') by\ndilution with water, the morphology is found to depend on the mixing ratio of\nthe two species, going gradually from vesicles via `bulbed' rods, rings,\nY-junctions and finally to spherical micelles as we increase the proportion of\nthe sphere-formers. On the other hand, if the two species are first partially\nself-assembled (by partial exchange of the solvent with water) before mixing\nand further self-assembly (`intermediate mixing'), novel metastable structures,\nincluding nanoscopic pouches, emerge. These experimental results are\ncorroborated by self-consistent field theory calculations (SCFT) which\nreproduce the sequence of morphologies seen in the pre-mixing experiments.

Conversely, we\nshow that this statement fails for all other reasonable voting rules.\n  This result is an extension of H\\\"aggstr\\\"om, Kalai and Mossel, who proved\nthe above in the case k=2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 15:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 07:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-31"}
