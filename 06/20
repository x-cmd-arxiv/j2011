For 12 of the 26 possible isomorphism types of a\nsporadic simple group G, the outer automorphism group Out(G) has order 2, and\nin the remaining 14 cases, Out(G) is trivial. Historically the suspicion of the\nexistence of a sporadic group was followed in fairly short order by the\ncalculation of a good upper bound on the size of its outer automorphism group.\nIn a few cases establishing the existence of certain outer automorphisms, like\nthe existence of the groups themselves, presented difficulties overcome only\nwith the use of machine computation. In any case these calculations can be\ndifficult to track down in the literature. This note, which contains nothing\nnew, is only intended to bring together these calculations. It also answers a\nquestion of Bob Oliver about the automorphism groups of some of these groups,\nhow they might be calculated, and specifically whether the Sylow 2-subgroups of\na sporadic simple group are self-centralizing in the automorphism group of the\nsimple group. The answer is that they are.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2011 16:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

This thermodynamically crucial quantity was proposed to be\n{\\it extensive}, i.e., in contemporary terms, $S(N) \\propto N$ in the\nthermodynamic limit $N \\to\\infty$. A decade later, Boltzmann proposed a\nfunctional form for this quantity which connects $S$ with the occurrence\nprobabilities of the microscopic configurations (referred to as {\\it\ncomplexions} at that time) of the system. This functional is, if written in\nmodern words referring to a system with $W$ possible discrete states,\n$S_{BG}=-k_B \\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \\ln p_i$. The BG entropy is {\\it additive},\nmeaning that, if A and B are two probabilistically independent systems, then\n$S_{BG}(A+B)=S_{BG}(A)+S_{BG}(B)$. The words, {\\it extensive} and {\\it\nadditive}, were practically treated, for over more than one century, as almost\nsynonyms, and $S_{BG}$ was considered to be the unique form that $S$ could\ntake. In other words, the functional $S_{BG}$ was considered to be universal.\nIt has become increasingly clear today that it is {\\it not} so, and that those\ntwo words are {\\it not} synonyms, but happen to coincide whenever we are\ndealing with paradigmatic Hamiltonians involving {\\it short-range} interactions\nbetween their elements, presenting no strong frustration and other\n\"pathologies\". These facts constitute the basis of a generalization of the BG\nentropy and statistical mechanics, introduced in 1988, and frequently referred\nto as nonadditive entropy $S_q$ and nonextensive statistical mechanics,\nrespectively. We briefly review herein these points, and exhibit recent as well\nas typical applications of these concepts in natural, artificial, and social\nsystems, as shown through theoretical, experimental, observational and\ncomputational predictions and verifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2011 21:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

We introduce a\nsymmetric rotating wave approximation that treats rotating and counter-rotating\nterms equally, preserves the invariances of the Hamiltonian with respect to its\nparameters, and reproduces several qualitative features of the spin-boson\nspectrum not present in the original rotating wave approximation both\noff-resonance and at deep strong coupling. The symmetric rotating wave\napproximation allows for the treatment of certain ultra and deep-strong\ncoupling regimes with similar accuracy and mathematical simplicity as does the\nRWA in the weak coupling regime. Additionally, we symmetrize the generalized\nform of the rotating wave approximation to obtain the same qualitative\ncorrespondence with the addition of improved quantitative agreement with the\nexact numerical results. The method is readily extended to higher accuracy if\nneeded. Finally, we introduce the two-photon parity operator for the two-photon\nRabi Hamiltonian and obtain its generalized symmetric rotating wave\napproximation. The existence of this operator reveals a parity symmetry similar\nto that in the Rabi Hamiltonian as well as another symmetry that is unique to\nthe two-photon case, providing insight into the mathematical structure of the\ntwo-photon spectrum, significantly simplifying the numerics, and revealing some\ninteresting dynamical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 04:57:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 00:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-14"}

While the progressive models are\nsuitable for modeling the spread of influence in monopolistic settings,\nnon-progressive are more appropriate for modeling non-monopolistic settings,\ne.g., modeling diffusion of two competing technologies over a social network.\nDespite the extensive work on the progressive model, non-progressive models\nhave not been studied well. In this paper, we study the spread of influence in\nthe non-progressive model under the strict majority threshold: given a graph\n$G$ with a set of initially infected nodes, each node gets infected at time\n$\\tau$ iff a majority of its neighbors are infected at time $\\tau-1$. Our goal\nin the \\textit{MinPTS} problem is to find a minimum-cardinality initial set of\ninfected nodes that would eventually converge to a steady state where all nodes\nof $G$ are infected.\n  We prove that while the MinPTS is NP-hard for a restricted family of graphs,\nit admits an improved constant-factor approximation algorithm for power-law\ngraphs. We do so by proving lower and upper bounds in terms of the minimum and\nmaximum degree of nodes in the graph. The upper bound is achieved in turn by\napplying a natural greedy algorithm. Our experimental evaluation of the greedy\nalgorithm also shows its superior performance compared to other algorithms for\na set of real-world graphs as well as the random power-law graphs.

Thus, if these mid-sized\nsatellites were simply accreted by collisions of similar ice-rock\nsatellitesimals in the disk, the observed wide diversity in density (i.e., the\nrock fraction) of the Saturnian mid-sized satellites is enigmatic. A recent\ncircumplanetary disk model suggests satellite growth in an actively supplied\ncircumplanetary disk, in which Titan-sized satellites migrate inward by\ninteraction with the gas and are eventually lost to the gas planet. Here we\nreport numerical simulations of giant impacts between Titan-sized migrating\nsatellites and smaller satellites in the inner region of the Saturnian disk.\nOur results suggest that in a giant impact with impact velocity > 1.4 times the\nescape velocity and impact angle of ~45 degree, a smaller satellite is\ndestroyed, forming multiple mid-sized satellites with a very wide diversity in\nsatellite density (the rock fraction = 0-92 wt%). Our results of the\nrelationship between the mass and rock fraction of the satellites resulting\nfrom giant impacts reproduce the observations of the Saturnian mid-sized\nsatellites. Giant impacts also lead to internal melting of the formed mid-sized\nsatellites, which would initiate strong tidal dissipation and geological\nactivity, such as those observed on Enceladus today and Tethys in the past. Our\nfindings also imply that giant impacts might have affected the fundamental\nphysical property of the Saturnian mid-sized satellites as well as those of the\nterrestrial planets in the solar system and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 07:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In particular, it\nhas been found that strains of order $10^{-8}$ produced by lunar and solar\ntides are capable to cause variations in the seismoacoustic decrement on the\norder of several percents. Some laboratory data (although obtained for higher\nfrequencies) also indicate the presence of very high dissipative nonlinearity.\nConventionally discussed dissipation mechanisms (thermoelastic loss in dry\nsolids, Biot and squirt-type loss in fluid-saturated ones) do not suffice to\ninterpret such data.

A total of 1,957 data sets were taken\nat 199 distinct locations, including urban and rural sites covering all 18\nAdministrative Districts of Hong Kong. The survey shows that the environmental\nlight pollution problem in Hong Kong is severe - the urban night-skies (sky\nbrightness at 15.0 mag per arcsec square) are on average ~100 times brighter\nthan at the darkest rural sites (20.1 mag per arcsec square), indicating that\nthe high lighting densities in the densely populated residential and commercial\nareas lead to light pollution. In the worst polluted urban location studied,\nthe night-sky at 13.2 mag per arcsec square can be over 500 times brighter than\nthe darkest sites in Hong Kong. The observed night-sky brightness is found to\nbe affected by human factors such as land utilization and population density of\nthe observation sites, together with meteorological and/or environmental\nfactors. Moreover, earlier night-skies (at 9:30pm local time) are generally\nbrighter than later time (at 11:30pm), which can be attributed to some public\nand commercial lightings being turned off later at night. On the other hand, no\nconcrete relationship between the observed sky brightness and air pollutant\nconcentrations could be established with the limited survey sampling. Results\nfrom this survey will serve as an important database for the public to assess\nwhether new rules and regulations are necessary to control the use of outdoor\nlightings in Hong Kong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 08:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-05"}

By using the standard nonequilibrium\nGreen's function (NGF) technique, it is demonstrated that, the spin-resolved\ntransport property for the system depends sensitively on both the width of AGNR\nand the polarization strength of FM leads. The tunneling magnetoresistance\n(TMR) around zero bias voltage possesses a pronounced plateau structure for\nsystem with semiconducting 7-AGNR or metallic 8-AGNR in the absence of exchange\nsplitting, but this plateau structure for 8-AGNR system is remarkably broader\nthan that for 7-AGNR one.

However,\nthe TMR is enhanced much for 8-AGNR system under the bias amplitude comparable\nto splitting strength. Further, the current-induced spin transfer torque (STT)\nfor 7-AGNR system is systematically larger than that for 8-AGNR one.

In order to improve the outcome efficiency, we propose an easily\nimplementable mechanism design whereby the server randomly drops packets with a\nprobability that is a function of the total arrival rate.

Three of\nthese theses articulate two traditional philosophical themes: viz. the\nprinciple of the identity of indiscernibles (which will come in two versions),\nand haecceitism.

In the flavor basis, the neutrino\nmass matrix is taken to be invariant under $S_3$ symmetry at the zeroth order.\nThe effects of breaking $S_3$ symmetry by matrices invariant under different\n$S_2$ subgroups of $S_3$ are studied. The resulting retrocirculant perturbation\nmatrix leads to the perturbed $S_3$ neutrino mass matrix having a trimaximal\neigenvector as suggested by the solar neutrino data. It is found that after the\nthird order perturbation the neutrino mixings only depend on the perturbation\nparameter and are consistent with the current experimental data leading to very\nsmall deviations from tribimaximal mixing. These perturbations in the $S_3$\ninvariant neutrino mass matrix result in interesting interplay between the\nsolar and the reactor neutrino mixing angles. We also get a strongly suppressed\nrange of effective Majorana mass which lies well within the reach of the\nongoing experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 11:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-24"}

A near critical\ndensity of compact bodies implies that most lines of sight will be\ngravitationally microlensed, and the paper focuses on looking for the predicted\neffects on quasar brightness and spectral variations. These signatures of\nmicrolensing include the shape of the Fourier power spectrum of the light\ncurves, near achromatic and statistically symmetric variations, and the absence\nof time dilation in the timescale of variability. For spectral changes, as the\ncontinuum varies there should be little corresponding change in the strength of\nthe broad lines. In all these cases, the observations are found to be\nconsistent with the predictions for microlensing by a population of stellar\nmass compact bodies. For multiply lensed quasars where the images vary\nindependently it is shown that stellar populations are too small to produce the\nobserved microlensing effects, implying a population of compact dark matter\nbodies of around a stellar mass along the line of sight. The most serious\nobjection to dark matter in the form of compact bodies has come from\nobservations of microlensing of stars in the Magellanic Clouds. In this paper\nthe expected event rate is re-analysed using more recent values for the\nstructure and dynamics of the Galactic halo, and it is shown that there is then\nno conflict with the observations. Finally, the possible identity of a near\ncritical density of dark matter in the form of stellar mass compact bodies is\nreviewed, with the conclusion that by far the most plausible candidates are\nprimordial black holes formed during the QCD epoch. The overall conclusion of\nthe paper is that primordial black holes should be seen alongside elementary\nparticles as viable dark matter candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 12:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

The aggregated X-ray spectra appear unlike standard sub-Eddington\naccretion state spectra which, alongside the lack of discernible variability at\nany energy, argues strongly against conventional two-component, sub-Eddington\nmodels. Although the lack of variability could be consistent with\ndisc-dominated spectra, sub-Eddington disc models are not sufficiently broad to\nexplain the observed spectra. Fits with a ~ Eddington accretion rate slim disc\nmodel are acceptable, but the fits show that the temperature decreases with\nflux, contrary to expectations, and this is accompanied by the appearance of a\nharder tail to the spectrum. Applying a suitable two-component model reveals\nthat the disc becomes cooler and less advection dominated as the X-ray flux\nincreases, and this is allied to the emergence of an optically-thick\nComptonisation medium. We present a scenario in which this is explained by the\nonset of a radiatively-driven wind from the innermost regions of the accretion\ndisc, as M33 X-8 exceeds the Eddington limit.

A challenging issue is to determine which variables and\n(their) lags are relevant, especially when there is a mixture of serial\ncorrelation (temporal dynamics), high dimensional (spatial) dependence\nstructure and moderate sample size (relative to dimensionality and lags). To\nthis end, an \\textit{integrated} solution that addresses these three challenges\nsimultaneously is appealing. We study the large vector auto regressions here\nwith three types of estimates. We treat each variable's own lags different from\nother variables' lags, distinguish various lags over time, and is able to\nselect the variables and lags simultaneously. We first show the consequences of\nusing Lasso type estimate directly for time series without considering the\ntemporal dependence. In contrast, our proposed method can still produce an\nestimate as efficient as an \\textit{oracle} under such scenarios. The tuning\nparameters are chosen via a data driven \"rolling scheme\" method to optimize the\nforecasting performance. A macroeconomic and financial forecasting problem is\nconsidered to illustrate its superiority over existing estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 14:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

However, even after nearly 7 years\nof operation of the Swift Observatory, only a handful of measurements have been\nmade soon (within a minute) after the gamma ray signal. This lack of early\nobservations fails to address burst physics at short time scales associated\nwith prompt emissions and progenitors. Because of this lack of sub-minute data,\nthe characteristics of the rise phase of optical light curve of short-hard type\nGRB and rapid-rising GRB, which may account for ~30% of all GRB, remain\npractically unknown. We have developed methods for reaching sub-minute and\nsub-second timescales in a small spacecraft observatory. Rather than slewing\nthe entire spacecraft to aim the optical instrument at the GRB position, we use\nrapidly moving mirror to redirect our optical beam. As a first step, we employ\nmotorized slewing mirror telescope (SMT), which can point to the event within\n1s, in the UFFO Pathfinder GRB Telescope onboard the Lomonosov satellite to be\nlaunched in Nov. 2011. UFFO's sub-minute measurements of the optical emission\nof dozens of GRB each year will result in a more rigorous test of current\ninternal shock models, probe the extremes of bulk Lorentz factors, provide the\nfirst early and detailed measurements of fast-rise GRB optical light curves,\nand help verify the prospect of GRB as a new standard candle.

The magnetic cylinder is composed of a region\nwith dense prominence plasma, which is flowing along the magnetic tube, whereas\nthe rest of the flux tube is occupied by coronal plasma. We use the WKB\napproximation to obtain analytical expressions for the period and the amplitude\nof the fundamental mode as functions of the flow velocity.

Since Yang-Mills theories are gauge\ntheories their elementary particles, the gauge bosons, cannot be described\nwithout fixing a gauge. Beyond perturbation theory, gauge-fixing in non-Abelian\ngauge theories is obstructed by the Gribov-Singer ambiguity. The construction\nand implementation of a method-independent gauge-fixing prescription to resolve\nthis ambiguity is the most important step to describe gauge bosons beyond\nperturbation theory. Proposals for such a procedure, generalizing the\nperturbative Landau gauge, are described here. Their implementation are\ndiscussed for two example methods, lattice gauge theory and the quantum\nequations of motion. The most direct access to the properties of the gauge\nbosons is provided by their correlation functions. The corresponding two- and\nthree-point correlation functions are presented at all energy scales. These\ngive access to the properties of the gauge bosons, like their absence from the\nasymptotic physical state space, the absence of an on-shell mass pole,\nparticle-like properties at high energies, and their running couplings.\nFurthermore, auxiliary degrees of freedom are introduced during gauge-fixing,\nand their properties are discussed as well. These results are presented for\ntwo, three, and four dimensions, and for various gauge algebras. Finally, the\nmodifications of the properties of gauge bosons at finite temperature are\npresented. Evidence is provided that these reflect the phase structure of\nYang-Mills theory. However, it is found that the phase transition is not\ndeconfining the gauge bosons, although the bulk thermodynamical behavior is of\na Stefan-Boltzmann type. The resolution of this apparent contradiction is also\npresented. This resolution also provides an explicit and constructive solution\nto the Linde problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 15:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 13:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 14:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 17:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

This slowdown affects the whole mixing region, and not\njust the vicinity of the wall. The reason is that when the chaotic mixing\nregion extends to the wall, a separatrix connects to it. The approach to the\nwall along that separatrix is polynomial in time and dominates the long-time\ndecay. However, if the walls are moved or rotated, closed orbits appear,\nseparated from the central mixing region by a hyperbolic fixed point with a\nhomoclinic orbit.

These asymmetries\ncan only be generated by soft, nonperturbative dynamical mechanisms and such\nmeasurements can provide insight not otherwise accessible into the color\nrearrangement that occurs during the hadronization stage of the fragmentation\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 15:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 16:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

As these systems are young, their properties may contain an imprint of\nthe star formation process at intermediate masses. However, these systems are\ngenerally spatially unresolved, making it difficult to probe their\ncircumstellar environment to search for manifestations of their formation\nprocess, such as accretion disks. Here we investigate the formation mechanism\nof Herbig Ae/Be (HAe/Be) binary systems by studying the relative orientation of\ntheir binary orbits and circumstellar disks. We present linear\nspectropolarimetric observations of HAe/Be stars over the Halpha line, which\nare used to determine the orientation of their circumstellar disks. In\nconjunction with data from the literature, we obtain a sample of 20 binaries\nwith known disk position angles (PAs). We compare our disk PA data to a model\nto investigate whether HAe/Be binary systems and their disks are co-planar.\nMoreover, in the light of a recent suggestion that some HAe/Be star\nspectropolarimetric signatures may not necessarily be related to circumstellar\ndisks, we re-assess the relationship between spectropolarimetric signatures and\ndisk PAs. We do this by comparing spectropolarimetric and high spatial\nresolution observations of young stellar objects. We find that\nspectropolarimetric observations of pre-main-sequence stars do trace\ncircumstellar disks. This finding is significant above the 3 sigma level. Using\nthis result, our data are entirely consistent with the situation in which\nHAe/Be binary systems and circumstellar disks are co-planar, while random\norientations can be rejected at the 2.2 sigma level. We conclude that HAe/Be\nbinary systems and the disks around the primaries are likely to be co-planar,\nwhich is consistent with the notion that these systems form via monolithic\ncollapse and subsequent disk fragmentation (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 15:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
