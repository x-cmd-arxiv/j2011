We find that at z~4 and 3, UV-bright\ngalaxies cluster more strongly than UV-faint ones, but at z~2.2 and 1.7, the\nUV-bright galaxies are no longer the most strongly clustered. We derive mass\nestimates for objects in our sample by comparing our measurements to the\npredicted clustering of dark matter haloes in the Millennium Simulation. From\nthese estimates, we infer relationships between halo mass and star formation\nrate (SFR), and find that the most massive dark matter haloes in our sample\nhost galaxies with high SFRs (M_1700 < -20, or > 50 M_sun/yr) at z~3 and 4,\nmoderate SFRs (-20<M_1700<-19, or ~20 M_sun/yr) at z~2.2, and lower SFRs\n(-19<M_1700<-18, or ~2 M_sun/yr) at z~1.7.

We also find that the objects with blue UV colors in\nour sample are much more strongly clustered than those with red UV colors, and\nwe propose that this may be due to the presence of the 2175A dust absorption\nbump in more massive halos, which contain the older stellar populations and\ndust needed to produce the feature. The relatively small area covered by the\nsurvey means that the absolute values of the correlation lengths and halo\nmasses we derive are heavily dependent on the \"integral constraint\" correction,\nbut the uniformly deep coverage across a large redshift interval allows us to\ndetect several important trends that are independent of this correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 18:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

However\nthe processes that lead to the observed correlations are contrary; the stellar\nlight that contributes to the optical is readily absorbed by dust which emits\nin the IR. Thus on small scales we expect these correlations to break down. We\nexamine seven nearby galaxies ranging from early- to late-types, on a\npixel-by-pixel basis and we demonstrate that there is disconnect between the\noptical and IR when normalized to the near-IR (H-band). We can decompose this\ndisconnect into two distinct components through a Principal Component Analysis\nof the H-band normalized SED of the pixels: one mainly correlated with\nvariations in the IR, the other correlated with variations in the optical. By\nmapping these two components it is clear they arise from distinct spatial\nregions. The IR dominated component is strongly associated with the specific\nstar-formation rate, while the optical-dominated component is broadly\nassociated with the stellar mass density. However, when the pixels of all\ngalaxies are compared, the well known optical-IR colour correlations return,\ndemonstrating that the variance observed within galaxies is around a mean which\nfollows the well-known trend. We also examine the extremely strong correlations\nbetween the IRAC-NIR colours and demonstrate that they are tight enough to use\na single IRAC-NIR colour (i.e. 8mum-H) to determine the fluxes in the other\nIRAC bands. These correlations arise from the differing contribution of stellar\nlight and dust to the IRAC bands, enabling us to determine pure stellar colours\nfor these bands, but still demonstrating the need for dust (or stellar)\ncorrections in these bands when being used as stellar (dust) tracers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 20:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Our\nprevious recent work showed scaling of an FMM on GPU clusters, with problem\nsizes in the order of billions of unknowns. That work led to an extremely\nparallel FMM, scaling to thousands of GPUs or tens of thousands of CPUs. This\npaper reports on a a campaign of performance tuning and scalability studies\nusing multi-core CPUs, on the Kraken supercomputer. All kernels in the FMM were\nparallelized using OpenMP, and a test using 10^7 particles randomly distributed\nin a cube showed 78% efficiency on 8 threads. Tuning of the\nparticle-to-particle kernel using SIMD instructions resulted in 4x speed-up of\nthe overall algorithm on single-core tests with 10^3 - 10^7 particles. Parallel\nscalability was studied in both strong and weak scaling. The strong scaling\ntest used 10^8 particles and resulted in 93% parallel efficiency on 2048\nprocesses for the non-SIMD code and 54% for the SIMD-optimized code (which was\nstill 2x faster). The weak scaling test used 10^6 particles per process, and\nresulted in 72% efficiency on 32,768 processes, with the largest calculation\ntaking about 40 seconds to evaluate more than 32 billion unknowns. This work\nbuilds up evidence for our view that FMM is poised to play a leading role in\nexascale computing, and we end the paper with a discussion of the features that\nmake it a particularly favorable algorithm for the emerging heterogeneous and\nmassively parallel architectural landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 21:02:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 20:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-30"}

When trapped in a 2D optical lattice, such a dipolar\nFermi gas has a very rich phase diagram at zero temperature, due to the\ncompetition between antiferromagnetism and superfluidity. At half filling, the\nantiferromagnetic state is the favored ground state. The superfluid state\nappears as the ground state at a smaller filling factor. In between there is a\nphase-separated region. The order parameter of the superfluid state can display\ndifferent symmetries depending on the filling factor and interaction strength,\nincluding d-wave ($d$), extend s-wave ($xs$), or their linear combination\n($xs+i\\times d$).

Such radiation spectrum is characterized by the strength\nparameter $a = \\lambda_{B}} e|B|/mc^2$, where $\\lambda_{B}}$ is the length\nscale of the turbulent field. When $a$ is much larger than the Lorentz factor\nof a radiating electron $\\gamma$, synchrotron radiation is realized, while\n$a\\ll 1$ corresponds to the so-called jitter radiation regime. Because for\n$1<a<\\gamma$ we cannot use either approximations, we should have recourse to\nthe Lienard-Wiechert potential to evaluate the radiation spectrum, which is\nperformed in this paper. We generate random magnetic fields assuming Kolmogorov\nturbulence, inject monoenergetic electrons, solve the equation of motion, and\ncalculate the radiation spectrum. We perform numerical calculations for several\nvalues of $a$ with $\\gamma = 10$. We obtain various types of spectra ranging\nbetween jitter radiation and synchrotron radiation.

A numerical\nmodel of the time evolution of the population density due to diffusion is\ninconsistent with the experimental data suggesting that diffusion is not\nresponsible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 16:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The integrality\ngap of this relaxation is known as the Grothendieck constant $\\ka(G)$ of $G$.\nWe present a closed-form formula for the Grothendieck constant of $K_5$-minor\nfree graphs and derive that it is at most 3/2. Moreover, we show that\n$\\ka(G)\\le \\ka(K_k)$ if the cut polytope of $G$ is defined by inequalities\nsupported by at most $k$ points. Lastly, since the Grothendieck constant of\n$K_n$ grows as $\\Theta(\\log n)$, it is interesting to identify instances with\nlarge gap. However this is not the case for the clique-web inequalities, a wide\nclass of valid inequalities for the cut polytope, whose integrality ratio is\nshown to be bounded by 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 21:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-15"}

Escher was the most well known\npractitioner in this style of mathematical visualization, but there are\nsignificant mathematical shapes to which he never applied his artistry. These\nshapes can incorporate designs that form images as appealing as those produced\nby Escher, and our paper explores this for traditional tessellations, Penrose\nTilings, fractals, and fractal/tessellation combinations. To illustrate the\nversatility of tiling art, images were created with multiple figures and\nnegative space leading to patterns distinct from the work of others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2011 20:26:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 16:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 05:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-26"}

By building on my earlier work on\nuniversal symmetry in string theory and using links between elliptic curves and\nhyperdeterminants, I find intriguing clues that these connections may be deep\nas well as useful. Ultimately any theory of the foundations of physics must\nexplain why there are four forces and three generations of fermions. In string\ntheory this would be a consequence of the choice of vacua.
