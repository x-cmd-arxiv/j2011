Following previous\nwork where the dust size distribution has been calculated from a state-of-the\nart collision model for dust aggregates that involves both coagulation and\nfragmentation (Paper I), the corresponding opacities are presented in this\nstudy. The opacities are calculated by applying the effective medium theory\nassuming that the dust aggregates are a mix of 0.1{\\mu}m silicate and graphite\ngrains and vacuum. In particular, we explore how the coagulation affects the\nnear-IR opacities and the opacity in the 9.7{\\mu}m silicate feature. We find\nthat as dust aggregates grow to {\\mu}m-sizes both the near-IR color excess and\nthe opacity in the 9.7 {\\mu}m feature increases. Despite their coagulation,\nporous aggregates help to prolong the presence of the 9.7{\\mu}m feature. We\nfind that the ratio between the opacity in the silicate feature and the near-IR\ncolor excess becomes lower with respect to the ISM, in accordance with many\nobservations of dark clouds. However, this trend is primarily a result of ice\nmantle formation and the mixed material composition of the aggregates, rather\nthan being driven by coagulation. With stronger growth, when most of the dust\nmass resides in particles of size 10{\\mu}m or larger, both the near-IR color\nexcess and the 9.7{\\mu}m silicate feature significantly diminish. Observations\nat additional wavelengths, in particular in the sub-mm range, are essential to\nprovide quantitative constraints on the dust size distribution within dense\ncores. Our results indicate that the sub-mm index {\\beta} will increase\nappreciably, if aggregates grow to ~100{\\mu}m in size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 16:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Metallicity dependent\nfeedback is generated by the winds of OB stars (M > 5 Msol) that form in the\nclumps. The quenching of star formation in clumps of decreasing metallicity\noccurs at later epochs due to weaker wind luminosities, thus resulting in\nhigher final star formation efficiencies (SFE_{exp}).

Here, \"robust\" refers to robustness to both independent and correlated\nsparse outliers, although we focus on the latter. A key application where this\nproblem occurs is in video surveillance where the goal is to separate a slowly\nchanging background from moving foreground objects on-the-fly. The background\nsequence is well modeled as lying in a low dimensional subspace, that can\ngradually change over time, while the moving foreground objects constitute the\ncorrelated sparse outliers. In this and many other applications, the foreground\nis an outlier for PCA but is actually the \"signal of interest\" for the\napplication; where as the background is the corruption or noise. Thus our\nproblem can also be interpreted as one of recursively recovering a time\nsequence of sparse signals in the presence of large but spatially correlated\nnoise.\n  This work has two key contributions. First, we provide a new way of looking\nat this problem and show how a key part of our solution strategy involves\nsolving a noisy compressive sensing (CS) problem. Second, we show how we can\nutilize the correlation of the outliers to our advantage in order to even deal\nwith very large support sized outliers. The main idea is as follows. The\ncorrelation model applied to the previous support estimate helps predict the\ncurrent support. This prediction serves as \"partial support knowledge\" for\nsolving the modified-CS problem instead of CS. The support estimate of the\nmodified-CS reconstruction is, in turn, used to update the correlation model\nparameters using a Kalman filter (or any adaptive filter). We call the\nresulting approach \"support-predicted modified-CS\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 17:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-17"}

The evolution of the\ninteracting particles is described through a time inhomogeneous transition\nprobability kernel that depends on the 'gradient' of the potential field. The\nparticles, in turn, dynamically modify the potential field through their\ncumulative input. Interacting Markov processes of the above form have been\nsuggested as models for active biological transport in response to external\nstimulus such as a chemical gradient. One of the basic mathematical challenges\nis to develop a general theory of stability for such interacting Markovian\nsystems and for the corresponding nonlinear Markov processes that arise in the\nlarge agent limit. Such a theory would be key to a mathematical understanding\nof the interactive structure formation that results from the complex feedback\nbetween the agents and the potential field. It will also be a crucial\ningredient in developing simulation schemes that are faithful to the underlying\nmodel over long periods of time. The goal of this work is to study qualitative\nproperties of the above stochastic system as the number of particles (N) and\nthe time parameter (n) approach infinity. In this regard asymptotic properties\nof a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system, that arises in the propagation\nof chaos limit of the stochastic model, play a key role. We show that under\nsuitable conditions this dynamical system has a unique fixed point. This result\nallows us to study stability properties of the underlying stochastic model. We\nshow that as N \\rightarrow \\infty, the stochastic system is well approximated\nby the dynamical system, uniformly over time. As a consequence, for an\narbitrarily initialized system, as N\\rightarrow \\infty and n \\rightarrow\n\\infty, the potential field and the empirical measure of the interacting\nparticles are shown to converge to the unique fixed point of the dynamical\nsystem. In general, simulation of such interacting Markovian systems is a\ncomputationally daunting task. We propose a particle based approximation for\nthe dynamic potential field which allows for a numerically tractable simulation\nscheme. It is shown that this simulation scheme well approximates the true\nphysical system, uniformly over an infinite time horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 18:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-17"}

The survey,\ndescribed in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of\nconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of CDM. The\nCLASH cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of\nspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized\nlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.\nSpecifically, twenty CLASH clusters are solely X-ray selected. The X-ray\nselected clusters are massive (kT > 5 keV; 5 - 30 x 10^14 M_solar) and, in most\ncases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their\nlensing strength (Einstein radii > 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to further\nquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution dark\nmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified\nhigh-redshift (z > 7) galaxies. The high magnification, in some cases, provides\nangular resolutions unobtainable with any current UVOIR facility and can yield\nz > 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. A total of 16\nbroadband filters, spanning the near-UV to near-IR, are employed for each\n20-orbit campaign on each cluster. These data are used to measure precise\n(sigma_phz < 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discovered\nmultiply-lensed images per cluster. Observations of each cluster are spread\nover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for Type Ia\nsupernovae at z > 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the dark\nenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch when\nthe universe is matter dominated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 21:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 20:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In the standard Kozai mechanism (SKM), the planet's orbit is\ncircular, and so the particle conserves vertical angular momentum. As a result,\nthe particle's orbit oscillates periodically, exchanging eccentricity for\ninclination. However, when the planet's orbit is eccentric, the particle's\nvertical angular momentum varies and its Kozai oscillations are modulated on\nlonger timescales---we call this the eccentric Kozai mechanism (EKM). The EKM\ncan lead to behavior that is dramatically different from the SKM. In\nparticular, the particle's orbit can flip from prograde to retrograde and back\nagain, and it can reach arbitrarily high eccentricities given enough time. We\nmap out the conditions under which this dramatic behavior (flipping and extreme\neccentricities) occurs, and show that when the planet's eccentricity is\nsufficiently high, it occurs quite generically. For example, when the planet's\neccentricity exceeds a few percent of the ratio of semi-major axes (outer to\ninner), around half of randomly oriented test particle orbits will flip and\nreach extreme eccentricities. The SKM has often been invoked for bringing pairs\nof astronomical bodies (star-star, planet-star, compact-object pairs) close\ntogether. Including the effect of the EKM will enhance the rate at which such\nmatchmaking occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

For this reason, cosmological\nstudies focused on the evolution of halo/subhalo pairs are vital. In this paper\nI describe a large catalogue of halo pairs extracted from the publicly\navailable Millennium Simulation (Springel et. al. 2005). (Throughout this work\nI use the term `halo' to refer both to individual haloes in the field and\nsubhaloes embedded in larger structures.) Pairs are selected according to\nwhether or not they come within a given critical (comoving) distance dcrit,\nwithout the prerequisite that they must merge. Also, a condition requiring\nhaloes to surpass a critical mass Mcrit during their history is imposed. The\nprimary catalogue, consisting of 502,705 pairs, is selected by setting dcrit=1\nMpc/h and Mcrit = 8.6 10^10 Msun/h (equivalent to 100 simulation particles).\nOne of the central goals of this paper is to evaluate the effects of modifying\nthese criteria. For this purpose, additional subcatalogues with more stringent\nproximity and mass conditions are constructed (i.e., dcrit=200 kpc/h or/and\nMcrit=8.6 10^11 Msun/h =1,000 simulation particles). I use a simple five stage\npicture to perform statistical analyses of their separations, redshifts,\nmasses, mass ratios, and relevant lifetimes. The fraction of pairs that never\nmerge (because one of the members is absorbed by an external halo or both\nmembers survive until today) is accounted for. These results provide a broad\npicture that captures the essential characteristics behind the evolution of\nhalo pairs. This is the first of a series of papers aimed to explore the huge\nwealth of information encoded in this catalogue. Such investigations will play\na fundamental role in future cosmological studies of interacting galaxies and\nbinary (and multiple) quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 20:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 14:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Important\ninitial steps toward examining the potential effects of rapid accretion were\nrecently made by Baraffe, Chabrier, & Gallardo, who showed that in the limit of\nlow-temperature (\"cold\") accretion, protostars may have much smaller radii than\nfound in previous treatments. Such small radii at the end of protostellar\naccretion would have the effect of making some young stars appear much older -\nperhaps as much as 10 Myr - than they really are. However, we argue that very\nrapid disk accretion is unlikely to be cold, because observations of the\nbest-studied pre-main sequence disks with rapid disk accretion outbursts - the\nFU Ori objects - have spectral energy distributions which imply large, not\nsmall, protostellar radii. In addition, theory indicates models that at high\naccretion rates, protostellar disks become internally hot and geometrically\nthick, making it much more likely that hot material is added to the star. In\naddition, the very large luminosity of the accretion disk is likely to\nirradiate the central star strongly, heating up the outer layers and\npotentially expanding them. Nevertheless, the Baraffe et al. calculations\nemphasize the importance of initial protostellar radii for subsequent\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 20:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-20"}

In this paper,\nbased on Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), the performance of OMP is analyzed\nunder general perturbations, which means both $\\bm y$ and $\\bm \\Phi$ are\nperturbed. Though exact recovery of an almost sparse signal $\\bm x$ is no\nlonger feasible, the main contribution reveals that the exact recovery of the\nlocations of $k$ largest magnitude entries of $\\bm x$ can be guaranteed under\nreasonable conditions. The error between $\\bm x$ and solution of OMP is also\nestimated. It is also demonstrated that the sufficient condition is rather\ntight by constructing an example. When $\\bm x$ is strong-decaying, it is proved\nthat the sufficient conditions can be relaxed, and the locations can even be\nrecovered in the order of the entries' magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 01:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 16:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2013 19:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Recent collaborations at the frontier of\nanthropology, archaeology, psychology, and cognitive science are culminating in\nspeculative but increasingly sophisticated efforts to answer to this question.\nExamining the skeletons of our ancestors gives cues as to anatomical\nconstraints that hindered or made possible various kinds of creative\nexpression.

How\nthe spectacular creativity of humans came about is the first topic addressed in\nthis chapter. Studies at the intersection of creativity and evolution are not\nlimited to investigations into the biological evolution of a highly creative\nspecies. Creative ideas themselves might be said to evolve through culture.\nHuman creativity is distinctive because of the adaptive and open-ended manner\nin which change accumulates. Inventions build on previous ones in ways that\nenhance their utility or aesthetic appeal, or make them applicable in different\nsituations. There is no a priori limit to how a creative idea might unfold. It\nis this proclivity to take an idea and make it our own, or 'put our own spin on\nit', that makes creative ideas evolve. The next section of this chapter\ninvestigates in what sense creative ideas evolve through culture. Finally, we\naddress what forces supported the evolution of creativity. Does being creative\nhelp us live longer, or attract mates? Perhaps creative projects can sometimes\ninterfere with survival and reproductive fitness; are there non-biological\nfactors that compel us to create?

In the present method, the description of the cluster wave function\nis extended from a simple (0$s$) harmonic-oscillator shell model to a few-body\nmodel with a realistic interaction, in which the wave function of the\nsubsystems are determined with the Stochastic Variational Method. In order to\ncalculate the matrix elements of the four-body system, we have developed a\nTriple Global Vector Representation method for the correlated Gaussian basis\nfunctions. To compare effects of the cluster distortion with realistic and\neffective interactions, we employ the AV8$^{\\prime}$ potential as a realistic\ninteraction and the Minnesota potential as an effective interaction. Especially\nfor $^1S_0$, the calculated phase shifts show that the $t+p$ and $h+n$ channels\nare strongly coupled to the $d+d$ channel for the case of the realistic\ninteraction. On the contrary, the coupling of these channels plays a relatively\nminor role for the case of the effective interaction. This difference between\nboth potentials originates from the tensor term in the realistic interaction.\nFurthermore, the tensor interaction makes the energy splitting of the negative\nparity states of $^4$He consistent with experiments. No such splitting is\nhowever reproduced with the effective interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 06:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Moreover, we discuss to what extent this\ncriterion can give information on the entanglement of the system. The criterion\nis generic in the sense that it can be applied to mixed and pure systems. Also,\nit can be easily extended to treat the correlation of multipartite systems. We\ncompare the results obtained from this criterion to those from concurrence for\nvarious examples and we gain agreement regarding entanglement.

Such experiments have been used to test the universality of free fall\nby comparing the acceleration of the atoms to that of a classical freely\nfalling object. In a recent paper, M\\\"uller, Peters and Chu [Nature {\\bf 463},\n926-929 (2010)] argued that atom interferometers also provide a very accurate\ntest of the gravitational redshift (or universality of clock rates).\nConsidering the atom as a clock operating at the Compton frequency associated\nwith the rest mass, they claimed that the interferometer measures the\ngravitational redshift between the atom-clocks in the two paths of the\ninterferometer at different values of gravitational potentials. In the present\npaper we analyze this claim in the frame of general relativity and of different\nalternative theories, and conclude that the interpretation of atom\ninterferometers as testing the gravitational redshift at the Compton frequency\nis unsound.

The comparison with isochrones shows that while the oldest\npopulation is approximately coeval in all fields, the age of the youngest\npopulations increases with increasing radius. Low-resolution spectroscopy in\nthe infrared CaII triplet region has been obtained for about 150 stars near the\ntip red giant branch in the same fields. Radial velocities and stellar\nmetallicities have been obtained from these spectra. The metallicity\ndistribution of each field has been analyzed together with those previously\nstudied. The metal content of the most metal-poor objects, which are also the\noldest according to the derived age-metallicity relationships, is similar in\nall fields independently of the radius. However, while the metallicity of the\nmost metal-rich objects measured, which are the youngest ones, remains constant\nin the inner 6 kpc, it decreases with increasing radius from there off. The\nsame is true for the mean metallicity. According to the derived age-metallicity\nrelationships, which are consistent with being the same in all fields, this\nresult may be interpreted as an outside-in formation scheme in opposition with\nthe inside-out scenario predicted by LCDM cosmology for a galaxy like the LMC.\nThe analysis of the radial velocities of our sample of giants shows that they\nfollow a rotational cold disk kinematics.

We present\nestimates of Lyman alpha emission from a protogalactic halo illuminated by UV\nbackground radiation fields with various intensities. For this purpose, we\nperformed cosmological hydrodynamics simulations with the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH, including a detailed network for primordial\nchemistry,comprising the formation of primordial molecules, a multi-level model\nfor the hydrogen atom as well as the photo-ionization and photo-dissociation\nprocesses in a UV background. We find that the presence of a background\nradiation field J_21 excites the emission of Lyman alpha photons, increasing\nthe Lyman alpha luminosity up to two orders of magnitude. For a halo of \\sim\n10^10 M_sun, we find that a maximum flux of 5 \\times 10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 is\nobtained for J21 \\times f_esc = 0.1, where f_esc is the escape fraction of the\nionizing radiation. Depending on the environmental conditions, the flux may\nvary by three orders of magnitude. For J_21 \\times f_esc > 0.1 the Lyman alpha\nluminosity decreases as the atomic hydrogen abundance becomes rather small. The\nfluxes derived here can be probed using Subaru and the upcoming James Webb\nSpace Telescope. The emission of Lyman alpha photons is extended and comes from\nthe envelope of the halo rather than its core. In the center of the halo, line\ntrapping becomes effective above columns of 10^22 cm^-2 and suppresses the\nemission of Lyman alpha. In addition, cooling by primordial molecules may\ndecrease the gas temperature in the central region, which further reduces Lyman\nalpha emission.

Firstly, the high-intensity feature vectors are automatically\nextracted using the local characteristics of each individual face from the\nGabor transformed images. Then ICA is applied on these locally extracted\nhigh-intensity feature vectors of the facial images to obtain the independent\nhigh intensity feature (IHIF) vectors. These IHIF forms the basis of the work.\nFinally, the image classification is done using these IHIF vectors, which are\nconsidered as representatives of the images. The importance behind implementing\nICA along with the high-intensity features of Gabor wavelet transformation is\ntwofold. On the one hand, selecting peaks of the Gabor transformed face images\nexhibit strong characteristics of spatial locality, scale, and orientation\nselectivity. Thus these images produce salient local features that are most\nsuitable for face recognition. On the other hand, as the ICA employs locally\nsalient features from the high informative facial parts, it reduces redundancy\nand represents independent features explicitly. These independent features are\nmost useful for subsequent facial discrimination and associative recall. The\nefficiency of IHIF method is demonstrated by the experiment on frontal facial\nimages dataset, selected from the FERET, FRAV2D, and the ORL database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 12:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-20"}

Due to the unusual flaring state of the\notherwise steady source we performed a prompt analysis of the 79-string\nconfiguration data to search for neutrinos that might be emitted along with the\nobserved gamma-rays. We performed two different and complementary data\nselections of neutrino events in the time window of 10 days around the flare.\nOne event selection is optimized for discovery of E^-2 neutrino spectrum\ntypical of 1st order Fermi acceleration. A similar event selection has also\nbeen applied to the 40-string data to derive the time-integrated limits to the\nneutrino emission from the Crab. The other event selection was optimized for\ndiscovery of neutrino spectra with softer spectral index and TeV energy\ncut-offs as observed for various galactic sources in gamma-rays. The 90% CL\nbest upper limits on the Crab flux during the 10 day flare are 4.73 x 10^-11\ncm-2 s-1 TeV-1 for an E^-2 neutrino spectrum and 2.50 x 10^-10 cm-2 s-1 TeV-1\nfor a softer neutrino spectra of E-2.7, as indicated by Fermi measurements\nduring the flare. IceCube has also set a time-integrated limit on the neutrino\nemission of the Crab using 375.5 days of livetime of the 40-string\nconfiguration data. This limit is compared to existing models of neutrino\nproduction from the Crab and its impact on astrophysical parameters is\ndiscussed. The most optimistic predictions of some models are already rejected\nby the IceCube neutrino telescope with more than 90% CL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 13:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 15:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

To study the\nexistence and properties of surface discrete solitons, an analysis of the dimer\nconfiguration is performed. The properties of symmetric and antisymmetric modes\nincluding the stability diagrams and bifurcations are investigated in closed\nform. For the case of a bulk medium, properties of fundamental on-site and\ninter-site localized modes are analyzed. On-site and inter-site surface\nlocalized modes are studied finding that they do not exist when nonlocal\ninteractions predominate with respect to local ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 14:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We present a new single degenerate (SD) model for\nSN Ia progenitors, in which the WD mass possibly reaches 2.3-2.7 M_sun. Three\nbinary evolution processes are incorporated; optically thick winds from\nmass-accreting WDs, mass-stripping from the binary companion star by the WD\nwinds, and WDs being supported by differential rotation. The WD mass can\nincrease by accretion up to 2.3 (2.7) M_sun from the initial value of 1.1 (1.2)\nM_sun, being consistent with high luminosity SNe Ia such as SN 2003fg, SN\n2006gz, SN 2007if, and SN 2009dc. There are three characteristic mass ranges of\nexploding WDs. In an extreme massive case, differentially rotating WDs explode\nas an SN Ia soon after the WD mass exceeds 2.4 M_sun because of a secular\ninstability at T/|W|\\sim 0.14. For a mid mass range of M_WD=1.5-2.4 M_sun, it\ntakes some time (spinning-down time) until carbon is ignited to induce an SN Ia\nexplosion after the WD mass has reached maximum, because it needs a loss or\nredistribution of angular momentum. For a lower mass case of rigidly rotating\nWDs, M_WD=1.38-1.5 M_sun, the spinning-down time depends on the timescale of\nangular momentum loss from the WD. The difference in the spinning-down time may\nproduce the \"prompt\" and \"tardy\" components.

These include\nthe encoding of information to either obtain protection from decoherence or to\npermit all-electrical operation, efficient spin busing across a quantum\ncircuit, and to enable quantum error correction utilizing the three-spin\nGreenberger-Horn-Zeilinger quantum state. Towards these goals we demonstrate\nfor the first time coherent manipulation between two interacting three-spin\nstates. We employ the Landau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg approach for creating and\nmanipulating coherent superpositions of quantum states. We confirm that we are\nable to maintain coherence when decreasing the exchange coupling of one spin\nwith another while simultaneously increasing its coupling with the third. Such\ncontrol of pairwise exchange is a requirement of most spin qubit architectures\nbut has not been previously demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 15:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 20:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-25"}

Our method always minimizes the average rejection rate and even\nreduce it to zero in many relevant cases, which cannot be achieved by\nconventional methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm or the heat\nbath algorithm (Gibbs sampler). Moreover, the geometric approach makes it\npossible to find not only a reversible but also an irreversible solution of\nrejection-free transition probabilities. This is the first versatile method\nthat can construct an irreversible transition kernel in general cases. We\ndemonstrate that the autocorrelation time (asymptotic variance) of the Potts\nmodel becomes more than 6 times as short as that by the conventional\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm.

It is a ubiquitous domain pattern that occurs in the process\nof magnetization reversal in direction of the long axis of the small element.\nVan den Berg argued that this pattern grows out of the flux closure domains as\nthe external field is reduced. Based on experimental observations and theory,\nwe argue that in sufficiently elongated thin-film elements, the concertina\npattern rather bifurcates from an oscillatory buckling mode. Using a reduced\nmodel derived by asymptotic analysis and investigated by numerical simulation,\nwe quantitatively predict the average period of the concertina pattern and\nqualitatively predict its hysteresis. In particular, we argue that the\nexperimentally observed coarsening of the concertina pattern is due to\nsecondary bifurcations related to an Eckhaus instability.
