New experimental investigations reported here\nshow that swimmer cells in the center of the colony stream inward toward the\ninoculation site and in the process form many complex patterns, including\nradial and spiral streams, in addition to concentric rings.

As theorists we use and play with this\nfree choice of factorization, which is naturally fixed for an experimentalist.\nFor theorists it offers an extension of the interpretations and is adequate to\ngeneralizations, as we point out in the examples of quantum teleportation and\nentanglement swapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 18:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 21:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

In contrast with the\nusual quadratures of the electromagnetic field, the entire set of single photon\ngates for spatial degrees of freedom does not require optical nonlinearity and,\nin principle, can be performed with a single device: the spatial light\nmodulator. Nevertheless, nonlinear optical processes, such as four-wave mixing,\nare needed in the implementation of two-photon gates.

However, our analysis of a published\nspectrum of the 16 August 2008 lunar eclipse shows that diffuse sunlight is a\nmajor component of the measured spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm.\nThe conclusion is supported by two distinct features, namely the spectrum's\ntail at short wavelengths and the unequal absorption by an oxygen collisional\ncomplex at two nearby bands.

The main\ngoal of our analysis is to test whether or not the observed companion mass\nratio distribution (CMRD) as a function of primary star mass and star formation\nenvironment is consistent with having been drawn from the field star IMF. We\nconsider samples of companions for M dwarfs, solar type and intermediate mass\nstars, both in the field as well as clusters or associations, and compare them\nwith populations of binaries generated by random pairing from the assumed IMF\nfor a fixed primary mass. With regard to the field we can reject the hypothesis\nthat the CMRD was drawn from the IMF for different primary mass ranges: the\nobserved CMRDs show a larger number of equal-mass systems than predicted by the\nIMF. This is in agreement with fragmentation theories of binary formation. For\nthe open clusters {\\alpha} Persei and the Pleiades we also reject the IMF\nrandom- pairing hypothesis. Concerning young star-forming regions, currently we\ncan rule out a connection between the CMRD and the field IMF in Taurus but not\nin Chamaeleon I. Larger and different samples are needed to better constrain\nthe result as a function of the environment. We also consider other companion\nmass functions (CMF) and we compare them with observations.

Finally, we\ndemonstrate the SLUG's capabilities by presenting outputs in the stochastic\nregime. SLUG is publicly distributed through the website\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/runslug/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Subtracting a late-time spectrum\nof the host galaxy, we isolate the contribution of SN2009nz and uncover broad\nfeatures typical of nearby GRB-SNe. This establishes unambiguously that\nGRB091127 was accompanied by a broad-lined Type Ic SN, and links a cosmological\nlong burst with a standard energy release (E_gamma,iso ~ 1.1e52 erg) to a\nmassive star progenitor. The spectrum of SN2009nz closely resembles that of\nSN2006aj, with SN2003dh also providing an acceptable match, but has\nsignificantly narrower features than SNe 1998bw and 2010bh, indicative of a\nlower expansion velocity. The photospheric velocity inferred from the SiII 6355\nabsorption feature, v_ph ~ 17,000 km/s, is indeed closer to that of SNe 2006aj\nand 2003dh than to the other GRB-SNe. Combining the measured velocity with the\nlight curve peak brightness and width, we estimate the following explosion\nparameters: M_Ni ~ 0.35 M_sun, E_K ~ 2.3e51 erg, and M_ej ~ 1.4 M_sun, similar\nto those of SN2006aj. These properties indicate that SN2009nz follows a trend\nof lower M_Ni for GRB-SNe with lower E_K and M_ej. Equally important, since\nGRB091127 is a typical cosmological burst, the similarity of SN2009nz to\nSN2006aj either casts doubt on the claim that XRF060218/SN2006aj was powered by\na neutron star, or indicates that the nature of the central engine is encoded\nin the SN properties but not in the prompt emission. Future spectra of GRB-SNe\nat z > 0.3, including proper subtraction of the host galaxy contribution, will\nshed light on the full dispersion of SN properties for standard long GRBs, on\nthe relation between SNe associated with sub-energetic and standard GRBs, and\non a potential dispersion in the associated SN types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In the case of a young supernova remnant,\nthe corresponding strength of the magnetic field is approximately 1 mG. The\npropagation speed of the shock wave is significantly stalled in the clouds\nbecause of the high density, while the shock maintains a high velocity in the\ndiffuse surrounding.

Evaluating the amplitude of the polarized Galactic emission in the\nSPIDER field, we conclude that the polarized emission from interstellar dust is\nas bright or brighter than the cosmological signal at all SPIDER frequencies\n(90 GHz, 150 GHz, and 280 GHz), a situation similar to that found in the\n\"Southern Hole.\" We show that two ~20-day flights of the SPIDER instrument can\nconstrain the amplitude of the B-mode signal to r<0.03 (99% CL) even when\nforeground contamination is taken into account. In the absence of foregrounds,\nthe same limit can be reached after one 20-day flight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 20:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 22:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-06"}

Three of the\nobjects (with spectral types T1.5, T2 and T3.5) have photometric distances\nwithin 25 pc and were missed by previous 2MASS searches due to more restrictive\ncolor selection criteria. The fourth object (spectral type T4.5) is more\ndistant than 25 pc and is only a single-band detection in 2MASS. We also\nexamine the potential for completing the census of nearby ultracool objects\nwith the PS1 3$\\pi$ survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 21:33:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 18:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

It is generally\naccepted that stars with initial masses below ~8 M_sun leave behind white\ndwarfs and that some sub-population of these lead to Type Ia supernovae.\nHowever, it is often tacitly assumed that metallicity has no effect on the rate\nof SNe Ia. We propose that a consequence of the effects of metallicity is to\nsignificantly increase the SN Ia rate in lower-metallicity galaxies, in\ncontrast to previous expectations. This is because lower-metallicity stars\nleave behind higher-mass white dwarfs, which should be easier to bring to\nexplosion. We first model SN Ia rates in relation to galaxy masses and ages\nalone, finding that the elevation in the rate of SNe Ia in lower-mass galaxies\nmeasured by LOSS is readily explained. However, we then see that models\nincorporating this effect of metallicity agree just as well. Using the same\nparameters to estimate the cosmic SN Ia rate, we again find good agreement with\ndata up to z~2.

In\nthis paper, we propose the use of dilute magnetic semiconductors to improve the\ncoherence of spatially oscillating electron-spin polarization. In dilute\nmagnetic semiconductors, the electron-spin polarization near the source\nelectrode dynamically induces the local spin polarization of magnetic\nimpurities through s-d spin-flip scattering.

The key issue in cooperative control of multi-agent systems is the\nsynthesis of local control and interaction rules among the agents such that the\nentire controlled system achieves a desired global behavior. For this purpose,\nthree fundamental problems have to be addressed: (1) task decomposition for\ntop-down design, such that the fulfillment of local tasks guarantees the\nsatisfaction of the global task, by the team; (2) fault-tolerant top-down\ndesign, such that the global task remains decomposable and achievable, in spite\nof some failures, and (3) design of interactions among agents to make an\nundecomposable task decomposable and achievable in a top-down framework. The\nfirst two problems have been addressed in our previous works, by identifying\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for task automaton decomposition, and\nfault-tolerant task decomposability. This paper deals with the third problem\nand proposes a procedure to redistribute the events among agents in order to\nenforce decomposability of an undecomposable task automaton. The\ndecomposability conditions are used to identify the root causes of\nundecomposability which are found to be due to over-communications that have to\nbe deleted, while respecting the fault-tolerant decomposability conditions; or\nbecause of the lack of communications that require new sharing of events, while\nconsidering new violations of decomposability conditions. This result provides\na sufficient condition to make any undecomposable deterministic task automaton\ndecomposable in order to facilitate cooperative tasking.

Youdin (2005a,b) carried out a detailed analysis and showed\nthat the instability allows chondrule-sized ($\\sim 1 $ mm) particles to undergo\nradial clumping with reasonable growth times even in the presence of a moderate\namount of turbulent stirring. The analysis of Youdin includes the role of\nturbulence in setting the thickness of the dust layer and in creating a\nturbulent particle pressure in the momentum equation. However, he ignores the\neffect of turbulent mass diffusivity on the disturbance wave. Here we show that\nincluding this effect reduces the growth-rate significantly, by an amount that\ndepends on the level of turbulence, and reduces the maximum intensity of\nturbulence the instability can withstand by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. The\ninstability is viable only when turbulence is extremely weak and the solid to\ngas surface density of the particle layer is considerably enhanced over\nminimum-mass-nebula values.

It is shown that by modelling the magnetostatics of\nthe memory-holding ionic current (oxygen vacancies in the Strukov memristor),\nthe memristor's magnetic flux can be identified as the flux arising from the\nions.

We confirm a [Fe/H] spread in this GC, but too small to\nclearly separate different sub-populations. We instead propose a classification\nusing a combination of Fe and Ba (much more abundant in the more metal-rich\ngroup) through a cluster analysis: we separated stars into a metal-rich (MR)\nand a metal-poor (MP) populations, each of them showing a Na-O anticorrelation,\nsignature of genuine GC, although with different ratios of primordial to\npolluted stars. The ratio [alpha/H] tracks iron and is higher in the MR\npopulation, suggesting an additional contribution by core-collapse supernovae.\nThe MR population shows a larger enrichment in s-process elements compared to\nthe MP one. This is probably due to the contribution by intermediate-low mass\nstars, because we find that the level of heavy s-process elements is larger\nthan the level of light s-process nuclei in the MR stars; however, a large\ncontribution by low mass stars is unlikely, because it would likely cancel the\nO-Na anticorrelation. We also confirm the presence of correlations between\np-capture and s-process elements previously found by other studies, at least\nfor the MR population. This finding apparently requires a quite long delay for\nthe second generation of the MR component. A merger of two distinct GCs in a\nparent dwarf galaxy, each one with a different Ba level and an age difference\nof ~1 Gyr, might explain (i) the double SGB, (ii) a possible difference in C\ncontent between the two original GCs, and (iii) the Stromgren photometry of\nthis peculiar GC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 09:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

In the spectrum of Q0151+048A (qA), a DLA is observed at a higher\nredshift. We have previously detected the host galaxies of both QSOs, as well\nas a Lya blob. We performed low-resolution spectroscopy with the slit aligned\nwith the extended emission. We also observed the system using the\nmedium-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectrograph and the slit aligned with the two\nQSOs. We measure systemic redshifts of zem(A)=1.92924{\\pm}0.00036 and\nzem(B)=1.92863{\\pm}0.00042 from the H{\\beta} and H{\\alpha} emission lines,\nrespectively. We estimate the masses of the black holes of the two QSOs to be\n10^9.33 M{\\odot} and 10^8.38 M{\\odot} for qA and qB, respectively. From this we\ninfered the mass of the dark matter halos hosting the two QSOs: 10^13.74\nM{\\odot} and 10^13.13 M{\\odot} for qA and qB, respectively. We observe a\nvelocity gradient along the major axis of the Lya blob consistent with the\nrotation curve of a large disk galaxy, but it may also be caused by gas inflow\nor outflow. We detect residual continuum in the DLA trough which we interpret\nas emission from the host galaxy of qA. The derived H0 column density of the\nDLA is log NH0 = 20.34 {\\pm} 0.02. Metal column densities results in an overall\nmetallicity of 0.01 Z{\\odot}. We detect CII* which allows us to make a physical\nmodel of the DLA cloud. From the systemic redshifts of the QSOs, we conclude\nthat the Lya blob is associated with qA rather than with the DLA. The DLA must\nbe located in front of both the Lya blob and qA at a distance larger than 30\nkpc. The two QSOs accrete at normal eddington ratios. The DM halo of this\ndouble quasar will grow to the mass of our local super-cluster at z=0.

Noise arising in the detection of the\nfringe pattern gives rise to both variance and biases in the power spectrum and\nbispectrum. Previous work on correcting the biases and estimating the variances\nfor these quantities typically includes restrictive assumptions about the\nsampling of the interferogram and/or about the relative importance of Poisson\nand Gaussian noise sources. Until now it has been difficult to accurately\ncompensate for systematic biases in data which violates these assumptions. We\nseek a formalism to allow the construction of bias-free estimators of the\nbispectrum and power spectrum, and to estimate their variances, under less\nrestrictive conditions which include both unevenly-sampled data and\nmeasurements affected by a combination of noise sources with Poisson and\nGaussian statistics. We used a method based on the moments of the noise\ndistributions to derive formulae for the biases introduced to the power\nspectrum and bispectrum when the complex fringe amplitude is derived from an\narbitrary linear combinations of a set of discrete interferogram measurements.\nWe simulated interferograms with different combinations of photon noise and\nread noise and with different fringe encoding schemes to illustrate the effects\nof these biases. We have derived formulae for bias-free estimators of the power\nspectrum and bispectrum which can be used with any linear estimator of the\nfringe complex amplitude. We have demonstrated the importance of bias-free\nestimators for the case of the detection of faint companions (for example\nexoplanets) using closure phase nulling. We have derived formulae for the\nvariance of the power spectrum and have shown how the variance of the\nbispectrum could be calculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 10:57:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 00:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The comparison of the\nparsec-scale structure observed at different epochs shows the presence of a\nnon-stationary jet feature moving with a superluminal apparent velocity of\n16.2c+-0.7c. Over three epochs at 8.4 GHz during this period the core flux\ndensity varies of about 50%, while the scatter in the jet flux density is\nwithin 10%. The polarization percentage of both core and jet components\nsignificantly change from 2 to 9 per cent, while the polarization angle of the\ncore shows an abrupt change of about 90 degrees becoming roughly perpendicular\nto the jet direction, consistent with a change in the opacity. To complete the\npicture of the physical processes at work, we complemented our observations\nwith multi-epoch VLBA data at 15 GHz from the MOJAVE programme spanning a time\nbaseline from 1995 to 2010.

The histograms of Doppler velocity show excess blueshifts while the\ncentroids reveal a pre-dominant blue wing in the line profiles.

Thus, the latter implies that it is the effective stress-energy\ntensor containing the scalar field, that plays the role of exotic matter, that\nis responsible for sustaining the wormhole geometry. More specifically, we\nconsider a zero redshift function and a particular choice for the scalar field\nand determine the remaining quantities, namely, the stress-energy tensor\ncomponents and the shape function.

We detected strong intensity and energy\ndependent variations in the pulse profiles during the outburst. The pulse\nprofile showed significant evolution over the outburst.

At low energies, the pulse profiles appeared complex,\nconsisting of multiple peaks and a narrow minimum. The amplitude of the second\nbrightest peak in low energies decreased with energy, and above 12 keV, the\nshape of the pulse profile changed to a single broad peak with a dip like\nfeature.

However, this requires\ndetailed radiative transfer (RT) modeling of individual stars, which becomes\nimpractical for large data sets. Another approach is to select the best-fit\nspectral energy distribution (SED) from a grid of dust shell models, allowing\nfor a faster determination of the luminosities and mass-loss rates for entire\nsamples. We have developed the Grid of RSG and AGB ModelS (GRAMS) to measure\nthe mass-loss return from evolved stars. The models span the range of stellar,\ndust shell and grain properties relevant to evolved stars. In this paper we\npresent the carbon-star grid and compare our results with data of Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) carbon stars from the SAGE and SAGE-Spec programs. We\ngenerate spherically symmetric dust shell models using the 2Dust code, with\nhydrostatic models for the central stars. We explore five values of the inner\nradius R_in of the dust shell (1.5, 3, 4.5, 7 and 12 R_star). We use amorphous\ncarbon dust mixed with 10% silicon carbide by mass. The grain sizes follows a\nKMH distribution. The models span 26 values of 11.3 um optical depth, ranging\nfrom 0.001 to 4. For each model, 2Dust calculates the output SED from 0.2 to\n200 um. Over 12,000 models have dust temperatures below 1800 K. The GRAMS\nsynthetic photometry is in good agreement with SAGE photometry for LMC\ncarbon-rich and extreme AGB star candidates, as well as spectroscopically\nconfirmed carbon stars from the SAGE-Spec study. Our models reproduce the IRAC\ncolors of most of the extreme AGB star candidates, consistent with the\nexpectation that a majority of these enshrouded stars have carbon-rich dust.\nFinally, we fit the SEDs of some well-studied carbon stars and compare the\nresulting luminosities and mass-loss rates with those from previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 15:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2011 09:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

We further study\nwhether this is also possible in one-dimensional stellar evolutionary\ncalculations. Our hydrodynamical simulations show that the helium-burning shell\nconvection zone in the helium core moves across the entropy barrier and reaches\nthe hydrogen-rich layers. This leads to mixing of protons into the hotter\nlayers of the core and to a rapid increase of the nuclear energy production at\nthe upper edge of the helium-burning convection shell - the hydrogen injection\nflash. As a result a second convection zone appears in the hydrogen-rich\nlayers. Contrary to 1D models, the entropy barrier separating the two\nconvective shells from each other is largely permeable to chemical transport\nwhen allowing for multidimensional flow, and consequently, hydrogen is\ncontinuously mixed deep into the helium core.
