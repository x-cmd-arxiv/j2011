More specifically, we investigate\nthe set of Nash equilibria (NE) of decentralized networks comprising several\ntransmitters communicating with a single receiver that implements single user\ndecoding. This scenario is modeled as a one-shot game where the players (the\ntransmitters) have discrete action sets (the channels). We show that the\ncorresponding game has always at least one NE in pure strategies, but,\ndepending on certain parameters, the game might possess several NE. We provide\nan upper bound for the maximum number of NE as a function of the number of\ntransmitters and available channels. The main contribution of this paper is a\nmathematical proof of the existence of a Braess-type paradox. In particular, it\nis shown that under the assumption of a fully loaded network, when transmitters\nare allowed to use all the available channels, the corresponding sum spectral\nefficiency achieved at the NE is lower or equal than the sum spectral\nefficiency achieved when transmitters can use only one channel. A formal proof\nof this observation is provided in the case of small networks. For general\nscenarios, we provide numerical examples that show that the same effect holds\nas long as the network is kept fully loaded. We conclude the paper by\nconsidering the case of successive interference cancellation at the receiver.\nIn this context, we show that the power allocation vectors at the NE are\ncapacity maximizers.

The inflation effect has been\ndiscussed in relation to the radius problem of WR stars, but has yet failed to\nexplain the large observed radii of Galactic WR stars. We wish to obtain a\nphysical perspective of the inflation effect, and study the consequences for\nthe radii of WR stars, and LBVs. For WR stars the observed radii are up to an\norder of magnitude larger than predicted by theory, whilst S Doradus-type LBVs\nare subject to humongous radius variations, which remain as yet ill-explained.\nWe use a dual approach to investigate the envelope inflation, based on\nnumerical models for stars near the Eddington limit, and a new analytic\nformalism to describe the effect. An additional new aspect is that we take the\neffect of density inhomogeneities (clumping) within the outer stellar envelopes\ninto account. Due to the effect of clumping we are able to bring the observed\nWR radii in agreement with theory. Based on our new formalism, we find that the\nradial inflation is a function of a dimensionless parameter W, which largely\ndepends on the topology of the Fe-opacity peak, i.e., on material properties.\nFor W>1, we discover an instability limit, for which the stellar envelope\nbecomes gravitationally unbound, i.e. there no longer exists a static solution.\nWithin this framework we are also able to explain the S Doradus-type\ninstabilities for LBVs like AG Car, with a possible triggering due to changes\nin stellar rotation. The stellar effective temperatures in the upper HR diagram\nare potentially strongly affected by the inflation effect. This may have\nparticularly strong effects on the evolved massive LBV and WR stars just prior\nto their final collapse, as the progenitors of SNe Ibc, SNe II, and long GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 18:54:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 10:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The search employs data collected with the CDF II\ndetector which correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 2.7\nfb$^{-1}$. We recorded this data with two kinds of triggers. The first kind\nrequired high-p$_T$ charged leptons and the second required both missing\ntransverse energy and jets. The search selects events consistent with a\nsignature of a single lepton ($e^\\pm/\\mu^\\pm$), missing transverse energy, and\ntwo jets. Jets corresponding to bottom quarks are identified with a secondary\nvertex tagging method and a jet probability tagging method. Kinematic\ninformation is fed in an artificial neural network to improve discrimination\nbetween signal and background. The search finds that both the observed number\nof events and the neural network output distributions are consistent with the\nstandard model background expectations, and sets 95% confidence level upper\nlimits on the production cross section times branching ratio.

As\nmost planets supposedly form in the inner disk regions, i.e., within a few tens\nof AU, it is crucial to study circumstellar disk on these scales to constrain\nthe conditions for planet formation. Our aims are to characterize the inner\nregions of the circumstellar disk around the young Herbig Ae/Be star HD97048 in\npolarized light. We use VLT/NACO to observe HD97048 in polarimetric\ndifferential imaging (PDI) mode in the H and Ks band. We spatially resolve the\ndisk around HD97048 in polarized flux in both filters on scales between\n~0.1\"-1.0\" corresponding to the inner ~16-160 AU. Fitting isophots to the flux\ncalibrated H-band image between 13 - 14 mag/arcsec^2 and 14 - 15 mag/arcsec^2\nwe derive a apparent disk inclination angle of 34+-5 deg and 47+-2 deg,\nrespectively. The disk position angle in both brightness regimes is almost\nidentical and roughly 80 deg. Along the disk major axis the surface brightness\nof the polarized flux drops from ~11 mag/arcsec^2 at ~0.1\" (~16 AU) to ~15.3\nmag/arcsec^2 at ~1.0\" (~160 AU). The brightness profiles along the major axis\nare fitted with power-laws falling off as ~r^(-1.78+-0.02) in H and\n~r^(-2.34+-0.04) in Ks. As the surface brightness drops off more rapidly in Ks\ncompared to H the disks becomes relatively bluer at larger separations possibly\nindicating changing dust grain properties as a function of radius. For the\nfirst time the inner ~0.1\"-1.0\" (~16-160 AU) of the surface layer of the\nHD97048 circumstellar disk have been imaged in scattered light demonstrating\nthe power of ground-based imaging polarimetry.

We also discuss the feasibility and propose that our approach can be\napplied to polar molecules, for their vibrational states have multi-level\nstructure which is partially harmonic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 22:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-28"}

The fermionic T-duality transformation is applied to\nthe D-brane and pp-wave solutions of type IIB supergravity. New supersymmetric\nsolutions of complexified supergravity are generated. We show that the pp-wave\nyields a purely imaginary background after two dualities, undergoes a geometric\ntransformation after four dualities, and is self-dual after eight dualities.\nNext we apply six bosonic and six fermionic T-dualities to the AdS_4 x CP^3\nbackground of type IIA supergravity, which is relevant to the current research\nin the amplitude physics. This helps to elucidate the potential obstacles in\nestablishing the self-duality, and quite independently from that shows us that\nfermionic T-dualities may be degenerate under some circumstances.

Namely: for\na lattice L in R^N, given a target vector r in R^N and a distance parameter d,\noutput the set of all lattice points w in L that are within distance d of r.\n  In this work we focus on combinatorial and algorithmic questions related to\nlist decoding for the well-studied family of Barnes-Wall lattices. Our main\ncontributions are twofold:\n  1) We give tight (up to polynomials) combinatorial bounds on the worst-case\nlist size, showing it to be polynomial in the lattice dimension for any error\nradius bounded away from the lattice's minimum distance (in the Euclidean\nnorm).\n  2) Building on the unique decoding algorithm of Micciancio and Nicolosi (ISIT\n'08), we give a list-decoding algorithm that runs in time polynomial in the\nlattice dimension and worst-case list size, for any error radius. Moreover, our\nalgorithm is highly parallelizable, and with sufficiently many processors can\nrun in parallel time only poly-logarithmic in the lattice dimension.\n  In particular, our results imply a polynomial-time list-decoding algorithm\nfor any error radius bounded away from the minimum distance, thus beating a\ntypical barrier for error-correcting codes posed by the Johnson radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 01:12:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2012 03:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-10"}

However, it has been shown that existing privacy-preserving trajectory\ndata publishing methods derived from partition-based privacy models, for\nexample k-anonymity, are unable to provide sufficient privacy protection.\n  In this paper, motivated by the data publishing scenario at the Societe de\ntransport de Montreal (STM), the public transit agency in Montreal area, we\nstudy the problem of publishing trajectory data under the rigorous differential\nprivacy model.

Nanoparticles have\nimportant advantages in comparison with the currently used ruby fluorescence\ngauge. Because of their small dimensions they can be spread uniformly over a\ndiamond surface without bridging between the two diamond anvils. Furthermore\ntheir properties are measured by broad band optical transmission spectroscopy\nleading to a very large signal-to-noise ratio even in the multi-megabar\npressure regime where ruby measurements become challenging. Finally their\nresonant frequencies can be tuned to lie in a convenient part of the visible\nspectrum accessible to CCD detectors. Theoretical calculations for a nanoshell\nwith a SiO2 core and a golden shell, using both the hybridization model and Mie\ntheory, are presented here. The calculations for the nanoshell in vacuum\npredict that nanoshells can indeed have a measurable pressure-dependent optical\nresponse desirable for gauges.However when the nanoshells are placed in\ncommonly used DAC pressure media, resonance peak positions as a function of\npressure are no longer single-valued and depend on the pressure media,\nrendering them impractical as a pressure gauge. To overcome these problems an\nalternative nanoparticle is studied: coating the nanoshell with an extra\ndielectric layer (SiO2) provides an easy way to shield the pressure gauge from\nthe influence of the medium, leaving the compression of the particle due to the\npressure as the main effect on the spectrum. We have analyzed the response to\npressure up to 200 GPa. We conclude that a coated nanoshell could provide a new\ngauge for high-pressure measurements that has advantages over current methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 09:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-06"}

We calculate the angular power spectrum\n(C_l) of the NIRB fluctuations caused by the distribution of these galaxies.\nAssuming a complete subtraction of any post-reionization component, C_l will be\ndominated by galaxies responsible for completing reionization (e.g., z~6). The\nshape of C_l at high l is sensitive to the amount of non-linear bias of dark\nmatter halos hosting galaxies. As the non-linear bias depends on the mass of\nthese halos, we can use the shape of C_l to infer typical masses of dark matter\nhalos responsible for completing reionization. We extend our previous study by\nusing a higher-resolution N-body simulation, which can resolve halos down to\n10^8 M_sun. We also include improved radiative transfer, which allows for the\nsuppression of star formation in small-mass halos due to photo-ionization\nheating. As the non-linear bias enhances the dark-matter-halo power spectrum on\nsmall scales, we find that C_l is steeper for the case with a complete\nsuppression of small sources or partial suppression of star formation in small\nhalos (the minimum galaxy mass is M_min=10^9 M_sun in ionized regions and\nM_min=10^8 M_sun in neutral regions) than the case in which these small halos\nwere unsuppressed.

It\nwas found that, during this stage, the cosmological gravitational waves (CGWs)\n- that had been produced in an earlier (inflationary) epoch - with comoving\nwave-numbers below a critical value (which depends on the physics of the\ncosmic-string network) were filtered, leading to a distorsion in the expected\n(scale-invariant) CGW power spectrum. In any case, the cosmological evolution\ngradually results in the scaling of any long-cosmic-string network and, hence,\nafter a short time-interval, the Universe enters into the late-radiation era.\nHowever, along the transition from an early-radiation epoch to the\nlate-radiation era through the radiation-plus-strings stage, the\ntime-dependence of the cosmological scale factor is modified, something that\nleads to a discontinuous change of the corresponding scalar curvature, which,\nin turn, triggers the quantum-mechanical creation of gravitons.

However, when it comes to the composition of the observed\nplanets the data are compatible with several interior structure models. Thus, a\nplanetary parameter sensitive to the planet's density distribution could help\nconstrain this large number of possible models even further. We aim to\ninvestigate to what extent an exoplanet's interior can be constrained in terms\nof core mass and envelope metallicity by taking the tidal Love number k_2 into\naccount as an additional possibly observable parameter. Because it is the only\nplanet with an observationally determined k_2, we constructed interior models\nfor the Hot Jupiter exoplanet HAT-P-13b by solving the equations of hydrostatic\nequilibrium and mass conservation for different boundary conditions. In\nparticular, we varied the surface temperature and the outer temperature\nprofile, as well as the envelope metallicity within the widest possible\nparameter range. We also considered atmospheric conditions that are consistent\nwith nongray atmosphere models. For all these models we calculated the Love\nnumber k_2 and compared it to the allowed range of k_2 values that could be\nobtained from eccentricity measurements of HAT-P-13b. We use the example of\nHAT-P-13b to show the general relationships between the quantities temperature,\nenvelope metallicity, core mass, and Love number of a planet. For any given k_2\nvalue a maximum possible core mass can be determined. For HAT-P-13b we find\nMcore < 27 ME, based on the latest eccentricity measurement. We are able to\nconstrain both the envelope and bulk metallicity of HAT-P-13b to 1 -- 11 times\nstellar metallicity and the extension of the isothermal layer in the planet's\natmosphere to 3 -- 44 bar. Assuming equilibrium tidal theory, we find lower\nlimits on the tidal Q consistent with 10^3 - 10^5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 12:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-12"}

The extreme events, defined as exceedences of the\nflux of walkers above a prescribed threshold, have been studied recently in the\ncontext of complex networks. This was motivated by the occurrence of rare\nevents such as traffic jams, floods, and power black-outs which take place on\nnetworks. In this work, we study extreme events in a generalized random walk\nmodel in which the walk is preferentially biased by the network topology. The\nwalkers preferentially choose to hop toward the hubs or small degree nodes. In\nthis setting, we show that extremely large fluctuations in event-sizes are\npossible on small degree nodes when the walkers are biased toward the hubs. In\nparticular, we obtain the distribution of event-sizes on the network. Further,\nthe probability for the occurrence of extreme events on any node in the network\ndepends on its 'generalized strength', a measure of the ability of a node to\nattract walkers. The 'generalized strength' is a function of the degree of the\nnode and that of its nearest neighbors. We obtain analytical and simulation\nresults for the probability of occurrence of extreme events on the nodes of a\nnetwork using a generalized random walk model. The result reveals that the\nnodes with a larger value of 'generalized strength', on average, display lower\nprobability for the occurrence of extreme events compared to the nodes with\nlower values of 'generalized strength'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 15:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 04:43:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 04:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-31"}

Basic calculations\nshow that the Minkowski momentum is the sum of electromagnetic momentum and the\nmomentum of the medium, as proposed in some of the past literature. The result\nhas been explicitly confirmed by an example of an MHD wave, whose dynamics can\nbe easily and precisely calculated from basic equations. The example of MHD\nwave also demonstrates the possiblility to construct a symmetric\nenergy-momentum tensor based on the Minkowski momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 10:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-13"}
