We develop a model\ntracing the evolution and de-hydrogenation of HAC dust and show that the\nobservation of an emission feature at 16.4 {\\mu}m (610 cm-1) in astronomical\nspectra signals the presence of the pentagonal carbon rings required for the\nformation of fullerenes. We suggest that the set of four IR emission lines\npreviously identified with C60 in many objects that also show the 16.4 {\\mu}m\nfeature and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bands arise from\nproto-fullerenes rather than C60. Tc1 is an example of a source in which\nde-hydrogenation has proceeded to the point where only fullerenes are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 16:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Resource detection patterns\nin space and time are not commonly studied, yet they are tightly coupled to\nlandscape properties and add relevant information on foraging behavior. By\nexploring simple foraging models in unpredictable environments we show that the\ndistribution of intervals between detected prey (detection statistics)is mostly\ndetermined by the spatial structure of the prey field and essentially distinct\nfrom predator displacement statistics. Detections are expected to be Poissonian\nin uniform random environments for markedly different foraging movements (e.g.\nL\\'evy and ballistic). This prediction is supported by data on the time\nintervals between diving events on short-range foraging seabirds such as the\nthick-billed murre ({\\it Uria lomvia}). However, Poissonian detection\nstatistics is not observed in long-range seabirds such as the wandering\nalbatross ({\\it Diomedea exulans}) due to the fractal nature of the prey field,\ncovering a wide range of spatial scales. For this scenario, models of fractal\nprey fields induce non-Poissonian patterns of detection in good agreement with\ntwo albatross data sets. We find that the specific shape of the distribution of\ntime intervals between prey detection is mainly driven by meso and\nsubmeso-scale landscape structures and depends little on the forager strategy\nor behavioral responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 17:43:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 22:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}

Major steps of our alternative polaronic theory are outlined\nstarting from the generic Hamiltonian with the unscreened (bare) Coulomb and\nelectron-phonon interactions accounting for critical temperatures of\nhigh-temperature superconductors without any adjustable parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 18:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

The state estimation algorithm,\ninvolving an extended Kalman filter, was shown to either remove or\nsignificantly reduce errors due to \"pixel locking\". It is concluded that the\nsignificant extra complexity and computational expense to achieve these\nrelatively small improvements are likely to be unwarranted for many situations.\nFor the purposes of determining the precise particle locations, it is concluded\nthat the simplified state estimation algorithm can be a viable alternative to\nusing more computationally-intensive measurement techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 19:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

Our analysis of the f-mode instability is based on a\ntime-domain code that evolves linear perturbations of rapidly rotating\npolytropic neutron star models. The extracted mode frequency and eigenfunctions\nare subsequently used in standard energy integrals for the gravitational wave\ngrowth and viscous damping. We find that nonlinear bulk viscosity has a\nmoderate impact on the size of the f-mode instability window, becoming an\nimportant factor and saturating the mode's growth at a relatively large\noscillation amplitude.

Observations, despite being controversial, have also revealed a\nrapid and permanent variation of the photospheric magnetic field in response to\nthe coronal magnetic field restructuring during the eruption. The Helioseismic\nand Magnetic Imager instrument (HMI) on board the newly launched Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO) produces seeing-free full-disk vector magnetograms at\nconsistently high resolution and high cadence, which finally makes possible an\nunambiguous and comprehensive study of this important back-reaction process. In\nthis study, we present a near disk-center, GOES -class X2.2 flare, which\noccurred in NOAA AR 11158 on 2011 February 15.

This field evolution is unequivocally associated with the flare\noccurrence in this sigmoidal active region, with the enhancement area located\nin between the two chromospheric flare ribbons and the initial conjugate hard\nX-ray footpoints. These results strongly corroborate our previous conjecture\nthat the photospheric magnetic field near the PIL must become more horizontal\nafter eruptions, which could be related to the newly formed low-lying fields\nresulted from the tether-cutting reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 20:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

As a first motivation of this work, it\nhighlights the difficulties one encounters when trying to understand the\ngravitational duality, present at the linearized level, in the full non-linear\nEinstein's theory or even just in an asymptotic regime of it. In the first\npart, we restrict the discussion to the Noetherian surface charges, called\n\"electric charges\", and study the existence of a larger phase space, than\npreviously known in the literature, where the awkward parity boundary\nconditions, firstly imposed by T. Regge and C. Teitelboim, are relaxed. In the\nabsence of these parity conditions, we show how the Einstein-Hilbert action is\na correct variational principle when it is supplemented by an anomalous\ncounter-term and construct conserved and finite charges associated to the\nlarger asymptotic symmetry group.

Using\nphotometry from Gemini, Keck, PAIRITEL, and WISE, we show that the galaxy is\nvery red (g-K = 4.3 AB mag), heavily obscured (A_V ~ 2 mag), and has the\nhighest metallicity of any GRB host to date (12 + log[O/H]_KD02 = 9.2): it is a\nclassical luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), with L_IR ~ 4 x 10^11 L_sun. While\nthese properties could be interpreted to support an association of this GRB\nwith very recent star formation, modeling of the broadband spectral energy\ndistribution also indicates that a substantial stellar mass of mostly older\nstars is present. The current specific star-formation rate is modest (specific\nSFR ~ 0.5 Gyr^-1), the current star-formation rate is not substantially\nelevated above its long-term average, and the host morphology shows no sign of\nrecent merger activity. Our observations are therefore equally consistent with\nan older progenitor, similar to what is inferred for other short-hard GRBs.\nGiven the precedent established by previous short GRB hosts and the significant\nfraction of the Universe's stellar mass in LIRG-like systems at z >~0.3, an\nolder progenitor represents the most likely origin of this event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This is accomplished by means of a Large Program targeting a\ndistance-limited (<30 Mpc) sample of 103 early types spanning a wide range in\nstellar masses. We acquired new ACIS-S observations for 61 objects down to a\nlimiting (0.3-10 keV) luminosity of 2.5x10^38 erg/s, and we include an\nadditional 42 objects with archival (typically deeper) coverage.

The measured\nnuclear X-ray luminosities are invariably highly sub-Eddington, with\n-8<log(L_X/L_Edd)<-4. As also found in a companion survey targeting Virgo early\ntypes, the active fraction increases with increasing host galaxy stellar mass,\nreflective of \"Eddington incompleteness\" within the lower-mass objects.

The fraction of\ngalaxies which are elliptical is a strong function of stellar mass; it is also\na strong function of halo mass, but only for central galaxies. We interpret\nthis in a scenario where elliptical galaxies are formed, probably via mergers,\nas central galaxies within their halos; satellite ellipticals are previously\ncentral galaxies accreted onto larger halos. The overall fraction of S0\ngalaxies increases strongly with halo mass, from ~10% to ~70%. We find striking\ndifferences between the central and satellites: 20+/-2% of central M_* >\n10^10.5 Msol galaxies are S0 regardless of halo mass, but satellite S0 galaxies\nare only found in massive (> 10^13 h^-1 Msol) halos, where they are 69+/-4% of\nthe M_* > 10^10.5 Msol satellite population. This suggests two channels for S0\nformation: one for central galaxies, and another which transforms lower mass\n(M_* <~ 10^11 Msol) accreted spirals into satellite S0 galaxies in massive\nhalos. Analysis of finer morphological structure (bars and rings in disk\ngalaxies) shows some trends with stellar mass, but none with halo mass; this is\nconsistent with other recent studies which indicate that bars are not strongly\ninfluenced by galaxy environment.

Players\nwould prefer to get the secret than to not get it and secondly with lesser\npreference, they would like as few other players to get the secret as possible.\nSeveral positive results have already been published to efficiently solve the\nproblem of rational secret sharing but only a handful of papers have touched\nupon the use of an asynchronous broadcast channel. [2] used cryptographic\nprimitives, [3] used an interactive dealer, and [4] used an honest minority of\nplayers in order to handle an asynchronous broadcast channel.\n  In our paper, we propose an m-out-of-n rational secret sharing scheme which\ncan function over an asynchronous broadcast channel without the use of\ncryptographic primitives and with a non-interactive dealer. This is possible\nbecause our scheme uses a small number, k+1, of honest players.

Furthermore,\nour protocol is immune to backward induction.\n  Later on in the paper, we extend our results to include malicious players as\nwell.\n  We also show that our protocol handles the possibility of a player deviating\nin order to force another player to get a wrong value in what we believe to be\na more time efficient manner than was done in Asharov and Lindell [5].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2011 07:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

The luminosity distances of low-redshift GRBs were calibrated with the\ncosmography method using a latest type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) sample. We find\nthat the gravitational lensing has non-negligible effects on the determination\nof cosmological parameters and dark energy. The gravitational lensing shifts\nthe best-fit constraints on cosmological parameters and dark energy. Because\nhigh-redshift GRBs are more likely to be reduced, the most probable value of\nthe observed matter density $\\Omega_M$ is slightly lower than its actual value.\nIn the $\\Lambda$CDM model, we find that the matter density parameter $\\Omega_M$\nwill shift from 0.30 to 0.26 after including the gravitational lensing effect.\nThe gravitational lensing also affects the dark energy equation of state by\nshifting it to a more negative value. We constrain the dark energy equation of\nstate out to redshift $z\\sim 8$ using GRBs for the first time, and find that\nthe equation of state deviates from $\\Lambda$CDM at the $1\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel, but agrees with $w=-1$ at the $2\\sigma$ confidence level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2011 09:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It has been argued that\nsynchronized oscillations contribute to these gamma-band activity [...\nhowever,] even when oscillations are observed, they undergo temporal\ndecorrelation over very few cycles. This is not easily accounted for in\nprevious network modeling of gamma oscillations. We argue here that\ninteractions between cortical layers can be responsible for this fast\ndecorrelation. We study a model of a V1 hypercolumn, embedding a simplified\ndescription of the multi-layered structure of the cortex. When the stimulus\ncontrast is low, the induced activity is only weakly synchronous and the\nnetwork resonates transiently without developing collective oscillations. When\nthe contrast is high, on the other hand, the induced activity undergoes\nsynchronous oscillations with an irregular spatiotemporal structure expressing\na synchronous chaotic state. As a consequence the population activity undergoes\nfast temporal decorrelation, with concomitant rapid damping of the oscillations\nin LFPs autocorrelograms and peak broadening in LFPs power spectra. [...]\nFinally, we argue that the mechanism underlying the emergence of synchronous\nchaos in our model is in fact very general. It stems from the fact that gamma\noscillations induced by local delayed inhibition tend to develop chaos when\ncoupled by sufficiently strong excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2011 14:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}
