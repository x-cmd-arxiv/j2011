An important open question in property testing is to determine for\nwhich functions f we can test f-isomorphism with a constant number of queries.\nDespite much recent attention to this question, essentially only two classes of\nfunctions were known to be efficiently isomorphism testable: symmetric\nfunctions and juntas.\n  We unify and extend these results by showing that all partially symmetric\nfunctions---functions invariant to the reordering of all but a constant number\nof their variables---are efficiently isomorphism-testable. This class of\nfunctions, first introduced by Shannon, includes symmetric functions, juntas,\nand many other functions as well. We conjecture that these functions are\nessentially the only functions efficiently isomorphism-testable.\n  To prove our main result, we also show that partial symmetry is efficiently\ntestable. In turn, to prove this result we had to revisit the junta testing\nproblem. We provide a new proof of correctness of the nearly-optimal junta\ntester. Our new proof replaces the Fourier machinery of the original proof with\na purely combinatorial argument that exploits the connection between sets of\nvariables with low influence and intersecting families.\n  Another important ingredient in our proofs is a new notion of symmetric\ninfluence. We use this measure of influence to prove that partial symmetry is\nefficiently testable and also to construct an efficient sample extractor for\npartially symmetric functions. We then combine the sample extractor with the\ntesting-by-implicit-learning approach to complete the proof that partially\nsymmetric functions are efficiently isomorphism-testable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2011 17:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-30"}

The relay is used to manage the\ninterference at the receivers. It is assumed that all nodes including the relay\nhave channel state information only for their own links and that the relay has\nM (greater than or equal to K) antennas in a K-user network. We pose the\nquestion: What is the benefit of exploiting the direct links from the source to\ndestinations compared to a simpler two-hop strategy. To answer this question,\nwe first establish the degrees of freedom of the interference channel with a\nMIMO relay, showing that a K-pair network with a MIMO relay has K/2 degrees of\nfreedom. Thus, appropriate signaling in a two-hop scenario captures the degrees\nof freedom without the need for the direct links. We then consider more\nsophisticated encoding strategies in search of other ways to exploit the direct\nlinks. Using a number of hybrid encoding strategies, we obtain non-asymptotic\nachievable sum-rates. We investigate the case where the relay (unlike other\nnodes) has access to abundant power, showing that when sources have power P and\nthe relay is allowed power proportional to O(P^2), the full degrees of freedom\nK are available to the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2011 21:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-30"}

Furthermore this data will be used\nfor validation of numerical simulations of two phase flows. To simultaneously\nmeasure the flow velocities inside and around the oil droplet by PIV the\nrefractive indices of both phases need to be matched.

The latter are mixed to match the refractive index of the\ncontinuous phase. Both phases are seeded with tracer particles required for\nPIV. A fluorescent dye is added to the dispersed phase to allow discrimination\nof the PIV signals originating from both phases by LIF. The LIF and PIV signals\nare captured by two high-speed cameras.

Each parametric trace usually consists\nof many meaningful trace slices merged together, each slice corresponding to\none parameter binding. This gives a semantics-based solution to parametric\ntrace analysis. A general-purpose parametric trace slicing technique is\nintroduced, which takes each event in the parametric trace and dispatches it to\nits corresponding trace slices. This parametric trace slicing technique can be\nused in combination with any conventional, non-parametric trace analysis\ntechnique, by applying the later on each trace slice. As an instance, a\nparametric property monitoring technique is then presented. The presented\nparametric trace slicing and monitoring techniques have been implemented and\nextensively evaluated.

We introduce a method to guide the modelling and\nthe dynamic composition of processes to build large distributed systems with\ndynamic adhoc architecture. The modelling and the composition are based on an\nevent-based approach that favour the decoupling of the system components. The\ncomposition uses the sharing of abstract communication channels. The method is\nappropriate to deal with evolving processes (with mobility, mutation). The\nevent-B method is used for practical support. A fauna and its evolution are\nconsidered as a working system; this system presents some specificities, its\nbehaviour is not foreseeable, it has an adhoc (not statically fixed)\narchitecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2011 10:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-30"}

FD stations, installed surrounding the SD array,\nmeasure the air fluorescence light emitted from extensive air showers (EASs)\nfor precise determination of their energies and species. The detectors employed\nat one of the three FD stations were relocated from the High Resolution Fly's\nEye experiment. At the other two stations, newly designed detectors were\nconstructed for the TA experiment. An FD consists of a primary mirror and a\ncamera equipped with photomultiplier tubes. To obtain the EAS parameters with\nhigh accuracies, understanding the FD optical characteristics is important.
