In this\npaper, we study parity games on graphs with bounded treewidth, and graphs with\nbounded DAG width. We show that parity games with bounded DAG width can be\nsolved in O(n^(k+3) k^(k + 2) (d + 1)^(3k + 2)) time, where n, k, and d are the\nsize, treewidth, and number of priorities in the parity game. This is an\nimprovement over the previous best algorithm, given by Berwanger et al., which\nruns in n^O(k^2) time. We also show that, if a tree decomposition is provided,\nthen parity games with bounded treewidth can be solved in O(n k^(k + 5) (d +\n1)^(3k + 5)) time. This improves over previous best algorithm, given by\nObdrzalek, which runs in O(n d^(2(k+1)^2)) time. Our techniques can also be\nadapted to show that the problem of solving parity games with bounded treewidth\nlies in the complexity class NC^2, which is the class of problems that can be\nefficiently parallelized. This is in stark contrast to the general parity game\nproblem, which is known to be P-hard, and thus unlikely to be contained in NC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 16:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 15:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 15:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 15:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 12:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 19:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

We compare the resulting\nresiduals and the estimated orbital parameters.\n  For synthetic data sets covering only a few orbital periods, we find that the\ndiscrete radial velocity signal generated by a coorbital configuration could be\neasily confused with other configurations/systems, and in many cases the best\norbital fit corresponds to either a single planet or two bodies in a 2/1\nresonance. However, most of the incorrect identifications are associated to\ndynamically unstable solutions.\n  We also compare the orbital parameters obtained with two different fitting\nstrategies: a simultaneous fit of two planets and a nested multi-Keplerian\nmodel. We find that the nested models can yield incorrect orbital\nconfigurations (sometimes close to fictitious mean-motion resonances) that are\nnevertheless dynamically stable and with orbital eccentricities lower than the\ncorrect nominal solutions.\n  Finally, we discuss plausible mechanisms for the formation of coorbital\nconfigurations, by the interaction between two giant planets and an inner\ncavity in the gas disk.

He considered himself a morphologist, and was preoccupied throughout\nhis career with matters of classification. Though his early life was difficult,\nand his pursuit of astronomy as a career was opposed by his father, he took a\nposition at Yerkes Observatory in 1926 and remained there for the rest of his\nworking life. Thematically, his work was also a unified whole. Beginning with\nspectroscopic studies under Otto Struve at Yerkes Observatory, by the late\n1930s he concentrated particularly on the young O and B stars. His work on\nstellar classification led to the Morgan-Keenan- Kellman [MKK] system of\nclassification of stars, and later - as he grappled with the question of the\nintrinsic color and brightness of stars at great distances - to the\nJohnson-Morgan UBV system for measuring stellar colors. Eventually these\nconcerns with classification and method led to his greatest single achievement\n- the recognition of the nearby spiral arms of our Galaxy by tracing the OB\nassociations and HII regions that outline them. After years of intensive work\non the problem of galactic structure, the discovery came in a blinding flash of\nArchimedean insight as he walked under the night sky between his office and his\nhouse in the autumn of 1951. His optical discovery of the spiral arms preceded\nthe radio-mapping of the spiral arms by more than a year. Morgan suffered a\nnervous breakdown soon after he announced his discovery, however, and so was\nprevented from publishing a complete account of his work. As a result of that,\nand the announcement soon afterward of the first radio maps of the spiral arms,\nthe uniqueness of his achievement was not fully appreciated at the time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 17:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-02"}

To study the circumstellar environment of SN2011fe we have\nobtained high-resolution spectroscopy of SN2011fe on 12 epochs, from 8 to 86\ndays after the estimated date of explosion, targeting in particular at the time\nevolution of CaII and NaI. Three main absorption systems are identified from\nCaII and NaI, one associated to the Milky Way, one probably arising within a\nhigh-velocity cloud, and one most likely associated to the halo of M101. The\nGalactic and host galaxy reddening, deduced from the integrated equivalent\nwidths (EW) of the NaI lines are E(B-V)=0.011+/-0.002 and E(B-V)=0.014+/-0.002\nmag, respectively.

They are discussed in the context of existing theories\nof spin ice and the following experimental techniques: dc and ac-magnetization,\nneutron scattering, neutron spin echo, and longitudinal and transverse field\n$\\mu$SR. The monopole theory is found to unify diverse experimental results,\nbut several discrepancies between theory and experiment are identified. One of\nthese, concerning the neutron scattering line shape, is explained by means of a\nphenomenological modification to the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 18:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 May 2012 10:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It is shown that this measure of nonadiabaticity applies\nin situations where other criteria, such as the energy gap criterion or the\nextent of population transfer, fail. We further propose to estimate this\nquantum fidelity efficiently with a generalization of the dephasing\nrepresentation to multiple surfaces. Two variants of the multiple-surface\ndephasing representation (MSDR) are introduced, in which the nuclei are\npropagated either with the fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) or with the\nlocally mean field dynamics (LMFD). The LMFD can be interpreted as the\nEhrenfest dynamics of an ensemble of nuclear trajectories, and has been used\npreviously in the nonadiabatic semiclassical initial value representation. In\naddition to propagating an ensemble of classical trajectories, the MSDR\nrequires evaluating nonadiabatic couplings and solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger (or\nmore generally, the quantum Liouville-von Neumann) equation for a single\ndiscrete degree of freedom. The MSDR can be also used to measure the importance\nof other terms present in the molecular Hamiltonian, such as diabatic\ncouplings, spin-orbit couplings, or couplings to external fields, and to\nevaluate the accuracy of quantum dynamics with an approximate nonadiabatic\nHamiltonian. The method is tested on three model problems introduced by Tully,\non a two-surface model of dissociation of NaI, and a three-surface model\nincluding spin-orbit interactions. An example is presented that demonstrates\nthe importance of often-neglected second-order nonadiabatic couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 18:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-28"}

The toy model follows a modular structure, where\nkey features -- e.g. planetesimal fragmentation, radial orbital decay, nebula\nturbulence -- can be switched on or off.

The\ncalculations are done in the framework of the Boltzmann equation with the\nBoltzmann statistics distribution functions and the ideal gas equation of\nstate. The applicability of these approximations is discussed. It's found that\nthe bulk viscosity of the hadron gas is much larger than the bulk viscosity of\nthe pion gas while the shear viscosity is found to be less sensitive to the\nmass spectrum of hadrons. The constant cross sections and the Boltzmann\nstatistics approximation allows one not only to conduct precise numerical\ncalculations of transport coefficients in the hadron gas but also to obtain\nsome relatively simple relativistic analytical closed-form expressions. Namely,\nthe correct single-component first-order shear viscosity coefficient is found.\nThe single-component first-order nonequilibrium distribution function, some\nanalytical results for the binary mixture and expressions for mean collision\nrates, mean free paths and times are presented. Comparison with some previous\ncalculations for the hadron gas and the pion gas is done too.

Although it is a\nfundamental problem, to the best of our knowledge, the problem hasn't been\nstudied yet. In this paper, an O(m^2n) algorithm is presented to determine\nwhether a string s is representable by a set W, where n is the number of\nstrings in W and each string has the same length m. However, looking for the\nminimum subset from a set to represent a given string is shown to be NP-hard.\nAlso, finding the smallest subset from a set to represent each string in the\noriginal set is NP-hard. We establishes inapproximability results and\napproximation algorithms for them. In addition, we prove that counting the\nnumber of strings representable is #P-complete. We then explore how the\nproblems change when the operator negation is available. For example, if the\noperator negation can be used, the number is some power of 2. This difference\nmaybe help us understand the problem more profoundly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 19:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2012 11:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

Here, we present and analyse\nsynthetic Suzaku observations of two cluster-size haloes obtained by processing\nwith PHOX the hydrodynamical simulation of the large-scale, filament-like\nregion in which they reside. Taking advantage of the simulated data, we test\nthe results inferred from the X-ray analysis of the mock observations against\nthe underlying, known solution. Remarkably, we are able to recover the\ntheoretical temperature distribution of the two haloes by means of the\nmulti-temperature fitting of the synthetic spectra. Moreover, the shapes of the\nreconstructed distributions allow us to trace the different thermal structure\nthat distinguishes the dynamical state of the two haloes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Further, purely\nalgebraic conditions have been derived which the corresponding Lagrangians have\nto obey in order that the field theories be twins of each other. A further\ndiagnostical tool which, in general, allows to distinguish the topological\ndefects of a given theory from the corresponding defects of its twins is the\nspectrum of linear fluctuations about these defects. Very recently, however,\nexplicit examples of twin theories have been constructed such that not only\ntheir shapes and energy densities coincide, but also their linear fluctuation\nspectra are the same. Here we show that, again, there exist purely algebraic\nconditions for the Lagrangian densities which imply that the corresponding\nfield theories are twins and that the fluctuation spectra about their defects\ncoincide. These algebraic conditions allow to construct an infinite number of\ntwins with coinciding fluctuation spectra for a given theory, and we provide\nsome explicit examples. The importance of this result is related to the fact\nthat coinciding defects with coinciding energy densities and identical\nfluctuation spectra are almost indistinguishable physically, that is,\nindistinguishable in a linear or semiclassical approximation. This implies that\nthe measurable physical properties of a kink, in general, do not allow to\ndetermine the theory which provides the kink uniquely. Instead, in principle an\ninfinite number of possible theories has to be considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 21:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Many analytical and numerical studies have identified the minimum time\nnecessary to implement a variety of quantum gates on coupled-spin qubit\nsystems.

In order to identify the\ncritical time $T^{\\ast}$, below which the target transformation is not\nreachable, as well as to determine the associated Pareto front, we introduce a\nnumerical method of Pareto front tracking (PFT). We consider closed two- and\nmulti-qubit systems with constant inter-qubit coupling strengths and each\nindividual qubit controlled by a separate time-dependent external field. Our\nanalysis demonstrates that unit fidelity (to a desired numerical accuracy) can\nbe achieved at any $T \\geq T^{\\ast}$ in most cases. However, the optimization\nsearch effort rises superexponentially as $T$ decreases and approaches\n$T^{\\ast}$. Furthermore, a small decrease in control time incurs a significant\npenalty in fidelity for $T < T^{\\ast}$, indicating that it is generally\nundesirable to operate below the critical time. We investigate the dependence\nof the critical time $T^{\\ast}$ on the coupling strength between qubits and the\ntarget gate transformation.

We explicitly determine the coefficients of the linear\ninequalities describing the facet defining hyperplanes of the stability region\npolytope. We further derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nstability of the system for general arrival processes with finite first and\nsecond moments. For the case of stationary arrival processes, the derived\nconditions characterize the system stability region. Furthermore, we obtain an\nupper bound for the average queueing delay of Maximum Weight (MW) server\nallocation policy which has been shown in the literature to be a throughput\noptimal policy for MQMS systems. Using a similar approach, we can characterize\nthe stability region for a fluid model MQMS system.

Realizing these planetary\nsystems are candidates to host extrasolar asteroid belts, we use mid-infrared\ndata from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to search for emission\nfrom dust in these systems. We find excesses around eight stars, indicating the\npresence of warm to hot dust (~100-500 K), corresponding to orbital distances\nof 0.1-10 AU for these solar-type stars. The strongest detection, KOI 1099,\ndemands ~500 K dust interior to the orbit of its exoplanet candidate. One star,\nKOI 904, may host very hot dust (~1200 K, corresponding to 0.02 AU). Although\nthe fraction of these exoplanet-bearing stars with detectable warm excesses\n(~3%) is similar to that found by Spitzer surveys of solar-type field stars,\nthe excesses detectable in the WISE data have much higher fractional\nluminosities (Ldust/L*) than most known debris disks, implying that the\nfraction with debris disks of comparable luminosity may actually be\nsignificantly higher. It is difficult to explain the presence of dust so close\nto the host stars, generally corresponding to dust rings at radii <0.3 AU; both\nthe collisional and Poynting-Robertson drag timescales to remove dust from the\nsystem are hundreds of years or less at these distances. Assuming a\nsteady-state for these systems implies large mass consumption rates with these\nshort removal timescales, meaning that the dust production mechanism in these\nsystems must almost certainly be episodic in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 01:13:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 03:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We address the \\emph{rebuilding ratio} problem, namely, in the case\nof erasures, what is the fraction of the remaining information that needs to be\naccessed in order to rebuild \\emph{exactly} the lost information? It is clear\nthat when the number of erasures equals the maximum number of erasures that an\nMDS code can correct then the rebuilding ratio is 1 (access all the remaining\ninformation). However, the interesting and more practical case is when the\nnumber of erasures is smaller than the erasure correcting capability of the\ncode. For example, consider an MDS code that can correct two erasures: What is\nthe smallest amount of information that one needs to access in order to correct\na single erasure? Previous work showed that the rebuilding ratio is bounded\nbetween 1/2 and 3/4, however, the exact value was left as an open problem.

In this paper, we\nqualitatively investigate this subject in a comprehensive manner with extensive\nexperimental and simulation studies. The basic idea is to plot image quality\nand imaging dose together as functions of number of projections and mAs per\nprojection over the whole clinically relevant range. A clear understanding on\nthe tradeoff between image quality and dose can be achieved and optimal\nlow-dose CBCT scan protocols can be developed for various imaging tasks in\nIGRT. Main findings of this work include: 1) Under the CS framework, image\nquality has little degradation over a large dose range, and the degradation\nbecomes evident when the dose < 100 total mAs. A dose < 40 total mAs leads to a\ndramatic image degradation. Optimal low-dose CBCT scan protocols likely fall in\nthe dose range of 40-100 total mAs, depending on the specific IGRT\napplications. 2) Among different scan protocols at a constant low-dose level,\nthe super sparse-view reconstruction with projection number less than 50 is the\nmost challenging case, even with strong regularization. Better image quality\ncan be acquired with other low mAs protocols. 3) The optimal scan protocol is\nthe combination of a medium number of projections and a medium level of\nmAs/view. This is more evident when the dose is around 72.8 total mAs or below\nand when the ROI is a low-contrast or high-resolution object. Based on our\nresults, the optimal number of projections is around 90 to 120. 4) The\nclinically acceptable lowest dose level is task dependent. In our study,\n72.8mAs is a safe dose level for visualizing low-contrast objects, while 12.2\ntotal mAs is sufficient for detecting high-contrast objects of diameter greater\nthan 3 mm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 07:24:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 19:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This heat transport enhancement is intimately related to a\ntransition in the turbulent flow structure from a regime dominated by a\nlarge-scale circulation (LSC), consisting of a single convection roll, at no or\nweak rotation to a regime dominated by vertically-aligned vortices at strong\nrotation. For a sample with an aspect ratio \\Gamma = D/L = 1 (D is the sample\ndiameter and L its height) the transition between the two regimes is indicated\nby a strong decrease in the LSC strength. In contrast, for \\Gamma = 1/2 Weiss\nand Ahlers [J. Fluid Mech. {\\bf{688}}, 461 (2011)] revealed the presence of a\nLSC-like sidewall temperature signature beyond the critical rotation rate. They\nsuggested that this might be due to the formation of a two-vortex state, in\nwhich one vortex extends vertically from the bottom into the sample interior\nand brings up warm fluid, while another vortex brings down cold fluid from the\ntop; this flow field would yield a sidewall temperature signature similar to\nthat of the LSC. Here we show by direct numerical simulations for \\Gamma= 1/2\nand parameters that allow direct comparison with experiment that the spatial\norganization of the vertically-aligned vortical structures in the convection\ncell do indeed yield (for the time average) a sinusoidal variation of the\ntemperature near the sidewall, as found in the experiment.

This means that they trace the ISM in\nthe galaxy at the time the star formed, and hence the chemical enrichment\nhistory of the galaxy. CMD analysis has shown the Carina dwarf spheroidal\n(dSph) to have had an unusually episodic star formation history (SFH) which is\nexpected to be reflected in the abundances of different chemical elements. We\nuse the VLT-FLAMES spectrograph in HR mode (R~20000) to measure the abundances\nof several chemical elements in a sample of 35 RGB stars in Carina. We also\ncombine these abundances with photometry to derive age estimates for these\nstars. This allows us to determine which of two distinct star formation (SF)\nepisodes the stars in our sample belong to, and thus to define the relationship\nbetween SF and chemical enrichment during these two episodes. As is expected\nfrom the SFH, Carina contains two distinct populations of RGB stars: one old\n(>10 Gyr), which we have found to be metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.5), and alpha-rich\n([Mg/Fe]>0.0); the other intermediate age (~2-6 Gyr), which we have found to\nhave a metallicity range (-1.8<[Fe/H]<-1.2) with a large spread in [alpha/Fe]\nabundance, going from extremely low values ([Mg/Fe]<-0.3) to the same mean\nvalues as the older population (<[Mg/Fe]>~0.3). We show that the chemical\nenrichment history of the Carina dSph was different for each SF episode. The\nearliest was short (~2-3 Gyr) and resulted in the rapid chemical enrichment of\nthe whole galaxy to [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 with both SNe II and SNe Ia contributions.\nThe subsequent episode occured after a gap of ~3-4 Gyr and appears to have\nresulted in relatively little evolution in either [Fe/H] or [alpha/Fe].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 11:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We show that the prescriptions for\nthe experimental set-up and some physical behaviors depend on the detection\nstrategy. More specifically, by exploiting the sample mean of escape times to\nperform detection, two resonant regions are identified. At low frequencies\nthere is a stochastic resonance/activation phenomenon, while near the plasma\nfrequency a geometric resonance appears. The naive sample mean detector is\noutperformed, in terms of error probability, by the optimal likelihood ratio\ntest. The latter exhibits only geometric resonance, showing monotonically\nincreasing performance as the bias current approaches the junction critical\ncurrent. In this regime the escape times are vanishingly small and therefore\nperformance are essentially limited by measurement electronics. The behavior of\nthe likelihood ratio and sample mean detector for different values of incoming\nsignal to noise ratio are discussed, and a relationship with the error\nprobability is found. The likelihood ratio test based detectors could be\nemployed also to estimate unknown parameters in the applied input signal. As a\nprototypical example we study the phase estimation problem of a sinusoidal\ncurrent, that is accomplished by using the filter bank approach.

In the\ndelivery system, heparin binds to a peptide which has been covalently\ncross-linked to a fibrin matrix. Growth factor in turn binds to the heparin,\nand growth factor release is governed by both binding and diffusion mechanisms,\nthe purpose of the binding being to slow growth factor release. The governing\nmathematical model, which in its original formulation consists of five partial\ndifferential equations, is reduced to a system of just two equations. We\nidentify the governing non-dimensional parameters that can be varied to tune\nthe growth factor release rate. In particular, we identify a parameter regime\nthat ensures slow passive release (usually desirable) of at least a fraction of\nthe growth factor. It is found that slow release is assured if the matrix is\nprepared with the concentration of cross-linked peptide greatly exceeding the\ndissociation constant of heparin from the peptide, and with the concentration\nof heparin greatly exceeding the dissociation constant of the growth factor\nfrom heparin. Also, for the first time, in vitro experimental release data is\ndirectly compared with theoretical release profiles generated by the model.

Although many of the\nmolecular genetic factors are now known, the system level regulation of growth\nis still poorly understood. A simple form of inhibition of cell proliferation\nis encountered in vitro in normally differentiating epithelial cell cultures\nand is known as \"contact inhibition\". The study presented here provides a\nquantitative characterization of contact inhibition dynamics on tissue-wide and\nsingle cell levels. Using long-term tracking of cultured MDCK cells we\ndemonstrate that inhibition of cell division in a confluent monolayer follows\ninhibition of cell motility and sets in when mechanical constraint on local\nexpansion causes divisions to reduce cell area. We quantify cell motility and\ncell cycle statistics in the low density confluent regime and their change\nacross the transition to epithelial morphology which occurs with increasing\ncell density. We then study the dynamics of cell area distribution arising\nthrough reductive division, determine the average mitotic rate as a function of\ncell size and demonstrate that complete arrest of mitosis occurs when cell area\nfalls below a critical value. We also present a simple computational model of\ngrowth mechanics which captures all aspects of the observed behavior.

Considerable research efforts are currently\ndevoted to elucidating mechanisms by which pairs of electrons can bind together\nthrough the mediation of a boson field different than the one associated to the\nvibrations of a crystal lattice. PuCoGa_5, a 5f-electron heavy-fermion\nsuperconductor with a record critical temperature T_c=18.5 K, is one of the\nmany compounds for which the short-range, isotropic attraction provided by\nsimple electron-phonon coupling does not appear as an adequate glue for\nelectron pairing.

Andreev reflection structures are\nclearly observed in the low-temperature spectra, and unambiguously prove that\nthe paired superconducting electrons have wavefunction with the d-wave symmetry\nof a four-leaf clover.

We search for new supernova remnants in the SMC\nand in particular for composite remnants with a central X-ray source. We study\nthe morphology of newly found candidate supernova remnants using radio, optical\nand X-ray images and investigate their X-ray spectra. Here we report on the\ndiscovery of the new supernova remnant around the recently discovered Be/X-ray\nbinary pulsar SXP 1062 in radio and X-ray images. The Be/X-ray binary system is\nfound near the centre of the supernova remnant, which is located at the outer\nedge of the eastern wing of the SMC. The remnant is oxygen-rich, indicating\nthat it developed from a type Ib event. From XMM-Newton observations we find\nthat the neutron star with a spin period of 1062 s shows a very high average\nspin-down rate of 0.26 s per day over the observing period of 18 days. From the\ncurrently accepted models, our estimated age of around 10000-25000 years for\nthe supernova remnant is not long enough to spin down the neutron star from a\nfew 10 ms to its current value. Assuming an upper limit of 25000 years for the\nage of the neutron star and the extreme case that the neutron star was spun\ndown by the accretion torque that we have measured during the XMM-Newton\nobservations since its birth, a lower limit of 0.5 s for the birth spin period\nis inferred.

This implies that neutron stars in Be/X-ray binaries with\nlong spin periods can be much younger than currently anticipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 15:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Thus, it has\nbeen suggested recently that the problems of dark energy and the origin of\ncosmic magnetic fields could be pointing to a modification of Maxwell's theory\non large scales. Here, we review such a proposal in which the scalar state\nwhich is usually eliminated be means of the Lorenz condition is allowed to\npropagate. On super-Hubble scales, the new mode is essentially given by the\ntemporal component of the electromagnetic potential and contributes as an\neffective cosmological constant to the energy-momentum tensor. The new state\ncan be generated from quantum fluctuations during inflation and it is shown\nthat the predicted value for the cosmological constant agrees with observations\nprovided inflation took place at the electroweak scale. We also consider more\ngeneral theories including non-minimal couplings to the space-time curvature in\nthe presence of the temporal electromagnetic background. We show that both in\nthe minimal and non-minimal cases, the modified Maxwell's equations include new\neffective current terms which can generate magnetic fields from sub-galactic\nscales up to the present Hubble horizon. The corresponding amplitudes could be\nenough to seed a galactic dynamo or even to account for observations just by\ncollapse and differential rotation in the protogalactic cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 10:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-07"}

Such phases are related to the parameter $z$ describing the\n$CPT$ violation; moreover, a non zero phase difference between particle and\nantiparticle arises only in presence of $CPT$ symmetry breaking. Thus, a\ncompletely new test for the $CPT$ invariance can be provided by the study of\nsuch phases in mixed mesons. Systems which are particularly interesting for\nsuch an analysis are the $B_{s}^{0}-\\bar{B}_{s}^{0}$ and the\n$K^{0}-\\bar{K}^{0}$ ones. In order to introduce non-cyclic phases, some aspects\nof the formalism describing the mixed neutral mesons are analyzed. Since the\neffective Hamiltonian of systems like $K^{0}-\\bar{K}^{0}$, $B^{0}-\\bar{B}^{0}$,\n$B_{s}^{0}-\\bar{B}_{s}^{0}$, $D^{0}-\\bar{D}^{0}$ is non-Hermitian and\nnon-normal, it is necessary to diagonalize it by utilizing the rules of\nnon-Hermitian quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 11:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The bag derivation\nof Regge's trajectories is invalidated by an integration of the energy and\nangular momentum over all values of the radius up to $r_0=c/\\omega$. This gives\nthe absurd result that \"total\" angular momentum decreases as the frequency\nincreases. The correct expression for the angular momentum is obtained from\nhyperbolic geometry of constant negative curvature $r_0$. When the square of\nthe relativistic mass is introduced, it gives a negative intercept which is the\nEuclidean value of the angular momentum.
