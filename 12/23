The approach\nallows one to simultaneously explore the trade-off between different objectives\nas well as the trade-off between robustness and nominal plan quality. In MCO, a\ndatabase of plans each emphasizing different treatment planning objectives, is\npre-computed to approximate the Pareto surface. An IMPT treatment plan that\nstrikes the best balance between the different objectives can be selected by\nnavigating on the Pareto surface. In our approach, robustness is integrated\ninto MCO by adding robustified objectives and constraints to the MCO problem.\nUncertainties of the robust problem are modeled by pre-calculated\ndose-influence matrices for a nominal scenario and a number of pre-defined\nerror scenarios. A robustified objective represents the worst objective\nfunction value that can be realized for any of the error scenarios. The\noptimization method is based on a linear projection solver and is capable of\nhandling large problem sizes resulting from a fine dose grid resolution, many\nscenarios, and a large number of proton pencil beams. A base-of-skull case is\nused to demonstrate the robust optimization method. It is demonstrated that the\nrobust optimizationmethod reduces the sensitivity of the treatment plan to\nsetup and range errors to a degree that is not achieved by a safety margin\napproach. A chordoma case is analyzed in more detail to demonstrate the\ninvolved tradeoffs between target underdose and brainstem sparing as well as\nrobustness and nominal plan quality. The latter illustrates the advantage of\nMCO in the context of robust planning. For all cases examined, the robust\noptimization for each Pareto optimal plan takes less than 5 min on a standard\ncomputer, making a computationally friendly interface possible to the planner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2011 16:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Calculations suggest that if the\nduration of a \"free\" fall becomes longer the eastward deflection will be\namplified in proportion with the increased duration. Instead of 20 micrometers\nfor a one-meter fall, one can expect deflections more than 1,000 times larger\nwhen the fall lasts a few minutes. The method proposed in this paper consists\nin using the buoyancy of a (non viscous) liquid in order to work in reduced\ngravity. Not surprisingly, as in many astronomical observations, the main\nchallenge is to minimize the level of \"noise\". Possible sources of noise are\ndiscussed and remedies are proposed. In principle, the experiment should be\ndone in superfluid helium. However, a preliminary experiment done in water gave\nencouraging results in spite of a fairly high level of noise. In forthcoming\nexperiments the main objective will be to identify and eliminate the main\nsources of noise. This experiment differs from the Foucault pendulum by its\ngreater flexibility.

The ratio of\nemission to column density, the emissivity, is then known from the\ncorrelations, as a function of frequency. The spectral distribution of this\nemissivity can be fit by a modified blackbody, whence the characteristic dust\ntemperature T and the desired opacity \\sigma_e(1200) at 1200 GHz can be\nobtained. We have analyzed 14 regions near the Galactic plane toward the Vela\nmolecular cloud, mostly selected to avoid regions of high column density (N_H >\n10^{22} cm^-2) and small enough to ensure a uniform T.

We present a statistical method that fits for the\nscaling relations of the SZ and X-ray cluster observables with mass while\njointly fitting for cosmology. The method is generalizable to multiple cluster\nobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the cluster\nselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derived\ncosmological constraints. We apply this method to a data set consisting of an\nSZ-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z > 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 of\nthe 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ survey, with 14 clusters having X-ray observations from\neither Chandra or XMM. Assuming a spatially flat LCDM cosmological model, we\nfind the SPT cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (Omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-\n0.037. In combination with measurements of the CMB power spectrum from the SPT\nand the seven-year WMAP data, the SPT cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795\n+- 0.016 and Omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on each\nparameter over the CMB data alone. We consider several extensions beyond the\nLCDM model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energy\nequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effective\nnumber of relativistic species (Neff), and a primordial non-Gaussianity (fNL).\nWe find that adding the SPT cluster data significantly improves the constraints\non w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the CMB,\nsupernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the Hubble constant. Considering\neach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sum\nof neutrino masses sum mnu < 0.28 eV at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and\n1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

This uniform dataset results in proper motion\nmeasurements that are improved by a factor ~5 over previous measurements from\nheterogeneous instruments, yielding internal velocity dispersion estimates 0.15\n+/- 0.01 mas/yr, which corresponds to 5.4 +/- 0.4 km/s at a distance of 8.4\nkpc.\n  Projecting a simple model for the cluster onto the sky to compare with our\nproper motion dataset, in conjunction with surface density data, we estimate\nthe total present-day mass of the cluster to be 15,000 (+7400 -6000) Solar\nmasses.

Whereas measurements in the cavernous sinus cumulate anatomical and\ntechnical difficulties, LH levels can be easily assessed from jugular blood.\nHowever, plasma levels result from a convolution process due to clearance\neffects when LH enters the general circulation. Simultaneous measurements\ncomparing LH levels in the cavernous sinus and jugular blood have revealed\nclear differences in the pulse shape, the amplitude and the baseline. Besides,\nexperimental sampling occurs at a relatively low frequency (typically every 10\nmin) with respect to LH highest frequency release (one pulse per hour) and the\nresulting LH measurements are noised by both experimental and assay errors. As\na result, the pattern of plasma LH may be not so clearly pulsatile. Yet,\nreliable information on the InterPulse Intervals (IPI) is a prerequisite to\nstudy precisely the steroid feedback exerted on the pituitary level. Hence,\nthere is a real need for robust IPI detection algorithms. In this article, we\npresent an algorithm for the monitoring of LH pulse frequency, basing ourselves\nboth on the available endocrinological knowledge on LH pulse (shape and\nduration with respect to the frequency regime) and synthetic LH data generated\nby a simple model. We make use of synthetic data to make clear some basic\nnotions underlying our algorithmic choices.

A work of Hill, Lewandowski\nand Nurowski has given a good foundation for this, reducing the field equations\nto a set of differential equations for two functions, one real, one complex, of\nthree variables. Under the assumption of the existence of one Killing vector,\nthe (infinite-dimensional) classical symmetries of those equations are\ndetermined and group-invariant solutions are considered. This results in a\nsingle ODE of the third order which may easily be reduced to one of the second\norder. A one-parameter class of power series solutions, g(w), of this\nsecond-order equation is realized, holomorphic in a neighborhood of the origin\nand behaving asymptotically as a simple quadratic function plus lower-order\nterms for large values of w, which constitutes new solutions of the twisting\ntype N problem. The solution found by Leroy, and also by Nurowski, is shown to\nbe a special case in this class. Cartan's method for determining equivalence of\nCR manifolds is used to show that this class is indeed much more general.\n  In addition, for a special choice of a parameter, this ODE may be integrated\nonce, to provide a first-order Abel equation.

In the low L_X limit, gas accretes in a stable,\nspherically symmetric fashion. In the high L_X limit, the inner gas is\nsignificantly heated up and expands, reducing the central mass inflow rate. The\nexpanding gas can turn into a strong enough outflow capable of expelling most\nof the gas at larger radii. For some intermediate L_X, the accretion flow\nbecomes unstable developing prominent non-spherical features, the key reason\nfor which is thermal instability (TI) as shown by our analyses. Small\nperturbations of the initially spherically symmetric accretion flow that is\nheated by the intermediate L_X quickly grow to form cold and dense clumps\nsurrounded by overheated low density regions. The cold clumps continue their\ninward motion forming filamentary structures; while the hot infalling gas slows\ndown because of buoyancy and can even start outflowing through the channels in\nbetween the filaments.

This method separates messages into components suitable for both\nlossless coding and 'lossy' or statistical coding techniques, compressing\ncomplex objects by separately encoding signals and noise. This is demonstrated\nby compressing the most significant bits of data exactly, since they are\ntypically redundant and compressible, and either fitting a maximally likely\nnoise function to the residual bits or compressing them using lossy methods.\nUpon decompression, the significant bits are decoded and added to a noise\nfunction, whether sampled from a noise model or decompressed from a lossy code.\nThis results in compressed data similar to the original. For many test images,\na two-part image code using JPEG2000 for lossy coding and PAQ8l for lossless\ncoding produces less mean-squared error than an equal length of JPEG2000.\nComputer-generated images typically compress better using this method than\nthrough direct lossy coding, as do many black and white photographs and most\ncolor photographs at sufficiently high quality levels. Examples applying the\nmethod to audio and video coding are also demonstrated. Since two-part codes\nare efficient for both periodic and chaotic data, concatenations of roughly\nsimilar objects may be encoded efficiently, which leads to improved inference.\nApplications to artificial intelligence are demonstrated, showing that signals\nusing an economical lossless code have a critical level of redundancy which\nleads to better description-based inference than signals which encode either\ninsufficient data or too much detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 00:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-26"}

Therefore, we predicted that there\nwould be seasonal variations in the ring atmosphere and ionosphere due to the\norientation of the ring plane to the sun (Tseng et al., 2010). The atoms and\nmolecules scattered out of the ring atmosphere by ion-molecule collisions are\nan important source for the inner magnetosphere (Johnson et al., 2006; Martens\net al. 2008; Tseng et al., 2010 and 2011).

In this paper we describe a fairly\ndifferent clustering process which occurs at any temperature and independently\nof any special stimulus or circumstance. As a matter of fact, this process is\nabout four times faster at 28 degree Celsius than at 15 degrees. Because of its\nsimplicity and low level of ``noise'' we think that this phenomenon can provide\na means for exploring the strength of inter-individual attraction between bees\nor other living organisms. For instance, and at first sight fairly\nsurprisingly, our observations showed that this attraction does also exist\nbetween bees belonging to different colonies. As this study is aimed at\nproviding a comparative perspective, we also describe a similar clustering\nexperiment for red fire ants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 08:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-26"}

Rotation is known to affect the nucleosynthesis of light elements in\nmassive stars, mainly by rotation-induced mixing. In particular, rotation\nboosts the primary nitrogen production. Models of rotating stars are able to\nreproduce the nitrogen observed in low-Z halo stars. Aims. Here we present the\nfirst grid of stellar models for rotating massive stars at low Z, where a full\ns-process network is used to study the impact of rotation-induced mixing on the\nnucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Methods. We used the Geneva stellar\nevolution code that includes an enlarged reaction network with nuclear species\nup to bismuth to calculate 25 M$_\\odot$ models at three different Z and with\ndifferent initial rotation rates. Results. First, we confirm that\nrotation-induced mixing leads to a production of primary $^{22}$Ne, which is\nthe main neutron source for the s process in massive stars. Therefore rotation\nboosts the s process in massive stars at all Z. Second, the neutron-to-seed\nratio increases with decreasing Z in models including rotation, which leads to\nthe complete consumption of all iron seeds at Z < 1e-3 by the end of core\nHe-burning. Thus at low Z, the iron seeds are the main limitation for this\nboosted s process. Third, as Z decreases, the production of elements up to the\nBa peak increases at the expense of the elements of the Sr peak. We studied the\nimpact of the initial rotation rate and of the uncertain\n$^{17}$O$(\\alpha,\\gamma)$ rate (which strongly affects the neutron poison\nstrength of $^{16}$O) on our results. This study shows that rotating models can\nproduce significant amounts of elements up to Ba over a wide range of Z.\nFourth, compared to the He-core, the primary $^{22}$Ne production in the\nHe-shell is even higher (> 1% in mass fraction at all Z), which could open the\ndoor for an explosive neutron capture nucleosynthesis in the He-shell, with a\nprimary neutron source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 10:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We are motivated to study such effects by adopting a\ncomplex network approach. Firstly we evaluate the simple case where connections\nbetween individuals are randomly removed due to fear factor.

Such a case is arguably more realistic since people may\nchoose to keep a few social contacts, e.g., with their family members and\nclosest friends, at any cost. Finally a study is conducted on the case where\nconnection removals are carried out dynamically while the infection is\nspreading out. Analytical and simulation results show that the fear factor may\nnot easily prevent an epidemic outbreak from happening in scale-free networks.\nHowever, it significantly reduces the fraction of the nodes ever getting\ninfected during the outbreak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 10:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-26"}

Using variational principles the\nevolution equation for the magnetic system is found which is strongly\ninfluenced by the local temperature profile. The system offers damped spin wave\nexcitations where the strength of damping is determined by the magneto-thermal\ncoupling. Applying the model to nanowires it is demonstrated that the energy\nspectrum is significantly affected by the boundary conditions as well as the\ninitial temperature distribution. In particular, the coupling between\ntemperature and magnetization is expected to be several orders stronger for the\nopen as for the isolated wire.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 11:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-26"}

We propose a different\nscheme here, in which despite the inherently different mathematical form of\nkinetic equations for ions and neutrals (e.g. Fokker-Planck vs. Boltzmann\ncollision integrals) both types of particle orbits can be integrated into one\nsingle code. We show that the approximations and shortcomings of this \"single\nsourcing\" concept (e.g., restriction to explicit ion drift orbit integration)\ncan be fully tolerable in a wide range of typical fusion edge plasma\nconditions, and be overcompensated by the code-system simplicity, as well as by\ninherently ensured consistency in geometry (one single numerical grid only) and\n(the common) atomic and surface process modules\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 13:28:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 12:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Moreover,\nthe fast rising proton contribution suggested by KASCADE-Grande data between\n10^17 eV and 10^18 eV should be of extragalactic origin. In case heavy nuclei\ndominate the flux at E >~ 10^18 eV, the transition energy can be close to the\nankle, if Galactic CRs are produced by sufficiently frequent transients as e.g.\nmagnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 14:50:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 19:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}

These networks have a complex\nnature, and we are still far from having a complete characterization of the\nprocess through which they integrate information, specially given the noisy\nenvironment in which that information is embedded. Guided by the many instances\nof constructive influences of noise that have been reported in the physical\nsciences in the last decades, here we explore how multiple signals are\nintegrated in an eukaryotic cell in the presence of background noise, or\nchatter. To that end, we use a Boolean model of a typical human signal\ntransduction network. Despite its complexity, we find that the network is able\nto display simple patterns of signal integration. Furthermore, our\ncomputational analysis shows that these integration patterns depend on the\nlevels of fluctuating background activity carried by other cell inputs. Taken\ntogether, our results indicate that signal integration is sensitive to\nenvironmental fluctuations, and that this background noise effectively\ndetermines the information integration capabilities of the cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 15:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-29"}
