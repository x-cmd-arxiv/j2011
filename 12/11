Their crucial role in TCP design and operation\nhas been studied extensively, in particular with respect to identifying\nnon-conformant, buggy, or underperforming behaviour. However, TCP segment\nretransmissions are often overlooked when examining and analyzing large traffic\ntraces. In fact, some have come to believe that retransmissions are a rare\noddity, characteristically associated with faulty network paths, which,\ntypically, tend to disappear as networking technology advances and link\ncapacities grow. We find that this may be far from the reality experienced by\nTCP flows. We quantify aggregate TCP segment retransmission rates using\npublicly available network traces from six passive monitoring points attached\nto the egress gateways at large sites. In virtually half of the traces examined\nwe observed aggregate TCP retransmission rates exceeding 1%, and of these,\nabout half again had retransmission rates exceeding 2%. Even for sites with low\nutilization and high capacity gateway links, retransmission rates of 1%, and\nsometimes higher, were not uncommon. Our results complement, extend and bring\nup to date partial and incomplete results in previous work, and show that TCP\nretransmissions continue to constitute a non-negligible percentage of the\noverall traffic, despite significant advances across the board in\ntelecommunications technologies and network protocols. The results presented\nare pertinent to end-to-end protocol designers and evaluators as they provide a\nrange of \"realistic\" scenarios under which, and a \"marker\" against which,\nsimulation studies can be configured and calibrated, and future protocols\nevaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2011 17:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-13"}

Usually the acceleration of the Universe, which is described\nby FRW metric, is due to dark energy. It is shown that this effect may be\nconsidered as a manifestation of torsion tensor for a flat Universe in the\nrealm of Teleparallel gravity. An observer with radial field velocity obey\nHubble's Law. As a consequence it is established that this is radial\nacceleration in a flat Universe. In Eq. (\\ref{24}) the acceleration is written\nin terms of the deceleration parameter, the Hubble's constant and the proper\ndistance. This may be interpreted as an acceleration of the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2011 22:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-14"}

In this scenario, all commutation relations are modified\nand the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is changed to the so-called\nGeneralized (Gravitational) Uncertainty Principle (GUP). Here, we present a\none-dimensional nonperturbative approach to quantum mechanics with minimal\nlength uncertainty relation which implies X=x to all orders and P=p+(1/3)\\beta\np^3 to first order of GUP parameter \\beta, where X and P are the generalized\nposition and momentum operators and [x,p]=i\\hbar. We show that this formalism\nis an equivalent representation of the seminal proposal by Kempf, Mangano, and\nMann and predicts the same physics. However, this proposal reveals many\nsignificant aspects of the generalized uncertainty principle in a simple and\ncomprehensive form and the existence of a maximal canonical momentum is\nmanifest through this representation. The problems of the free particle and the\nharmonic oscillator are exactly solved in this GUP framework and the effects of\nGUP on the thermodynamics of these systems are also presented. Although X, P,\nand the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator all are formally self-adjoint,\nthe careful study of the domains of these operators shows that only the\nmomentum operator remains self-adjoint in the presence of the minimal length\nuncertainty.

Its early history involves the childhood not only\nof the quantum atom, but also of the concept of isotopy. Bohr's prediction of\nthe isotope effect was apparently at odds with early attempts to distinguish\nbetween isotopes by means of their optical spectra. However, in 1920 the effect\nwas discovered in HCl molecules, which gave rise to a fruitful development in\nmolecular spectroscopy. The first detection of an atomic isotope effect was no\nless important, as it was by this means that the heavy hydrogen isotope\ndeuterium was discovered in 1932.

We use coagulation/fragmentation and disk-structure models, to simulate\nthe evolution of dust in a bumpy surface density profile which we mimic with a\nsinusoidal disturbance. For different values of the amplitude and length scale\nof the bumps, we investigate the ability of this model to produce and retain\nlarge particles on million years time scales. In addition, we introduced a\ncomparison between the pressure inhomogeneities considered in this work and the\npressure profiles that come from magnetorotational instability. Using the\nCommon Astronomy Software Applications ALMA simulator, we study if there are\nobservational signatures of these pressure inhomogeneities that can be seen\nwith ALMA.

The model also gives a satisfactory estimate of present vacuum energy\ndensity and solves cosmological constant problem of 120 orders of magnitude\ndiscrepancy of vacuum energy density. Further, this model predicts existence of\ndark matter/energy and gives an extremely accurate estimate of present energy\ndensity of dark matter and energy. Alongwith explanations of graceful exit,\nradiation era, matter domination, this model also indicates the reason for\npresent accelerated state of the universe.
