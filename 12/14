Organisms use a variety of mechanisms to protect themselves\nagainst perturbations. For example, repair mechanisms fix damage, feedback\nloops keep homeostatic systems at their setpoints, and biochemical filters\ndistinguish signal from noise. Such buffering mechanisms are often discussed in\nterms of robustness, which may be measured by reduced sensitivity of\nperformance to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings. I use a\nmathematical model to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of robustness in order\nto understand aspects of organismal design by natural selection. I focus on two\ncharacters: one character performs an adaptive task; the other character\nbuffers the performance of the first character against perturbations. Increased\nperturbations favor enhanced buffering and robustness, which in turn decreases\nsensitivity and reduces the intensity of natural selection on the adaptive\ncharacter. Reduced selective pressure on the adaptive character often leads to\na less costly, lower performance trait. Conclusions/Significance. The paradox\nof robustness arises from evolutionary dynamics: enhanced robustness causes an\nevolutionary reduction in the adaptive performance of the target character,\nleading to a degree of maladaptation compared to what could be achieved by\nnatural selection in the absence of robustness mechanisms. Over evolutionary\ntime, buffering traits may become layered on top of each other, while the\nunderlying adaptive traits become replaced by cheaper, lower performance\ncomponents. The paradox of robustness has widespread implications for\nunderstanding organismal design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 16:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-14"}

To explain\nthe two-peaks in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the nucleus of M87\nwhich is similar to those of blazars, the most commonly adopted models are the\nsynchrotron self-Compton scattering (SSC) models and the external inverse\nCompton scattering (EIC) models. Considering that there is no correlated\nvariation in the soft band (from radio to X-ray) matching the TeV variation,\nand the TeV sources should not suffer from the gamma-gamma absorption due to\nthe flat TeV spectrum, the EIC models are advantageous in modeling the TeV\nemission from M87. In this paper, we propose a self-consistent EIC model to\nexplain the flat TeV spectrum of M87 within the framework of fully general\nrelativity, where the background soft photons are from the advection-dominated\naccretion flow (ADAF) around the central black hole, and the high energy\nelectrons are from the mini-jets which are powered by the magnetic reconnection\nin the main jet (Giannios et al. 2010). In our model, both the TeV flares\nobserved in the years of 2005 and 2008 could be well explained: the gamma-gamma\nabsorption for TeV photons is very low, even inside the region very close to\nthe black hole 20Rg~50Rg; at the same region, the average EIC cooling time (~\n10^2-10^3s) is short, which is consistent with the observed time scale of TeV\nvariation.

We explore the possibility that these sources are\nmembers of a new GRB family related to a single core-collapse. We use this\nunderstanding of the source in order to infer the unobserved redshift of GRB\n101023. [...]. Aims: In precise analogy with GRB 090618 we aim to analyze the\n89s of emission of GRB 101023 to see if we are in presence of two different\nepisodes: the first one presenting a characteristic Black-body temperature\nevolution, evolving in time with a broken power-law, and the second one\nconsistent with a canonical GRB. [...] Results: We confirm that the first\nepisode can be well fit by a Black body plus a power-law model. The temperature\nchanges with time following a broken power law, and the photon index of the\npower-law component presents a soft to hard evolution. We estimate the radius\nof this source, increasing with time with a velocity of 1.5x10^4 km/s. The\nsecond episode appears to be a canonical GRB. By using the Amati relation and\nthe Atteia relation, we determine the cosmological redshift, z ~ 0.9 +- 0.084\n(stat.) +- 0.2 (sys.). [...]. Particularly striking is the scaling law of the\nsoft X-ray component of the afterglow.

Here we focus on the Li-rich WGB stars and\nreport on their evolutionary status. We explore different paths to propose a\ntentative explanation for the lithium anomaly. Using archive data, we derive\nthe fundamental parameters of WGB (Teff, log g, log(L/Lsun)) using Hipparcos\nparallaxes and recent temperature scales. From the equivalent widths of Li\nresonance line at 6707 {\\AA}, we uniformly derive the lithium abundances and\napply when possible NLTE corrections following the procedure described by Lind\net al. (2009). We also compute dedicated stellar evolution models in the mass\nrange 3.0 to 4.5 Msun, exploring the effects of rotation-induced and\nthermohaline mixing. These models are used to locate the WGB stars in the H-R\ndiagram and to explore the origin of the abundance anomalies. The location of\nWGB stars in the H-R diagram shows that these are intermediate mass stars of\nmasses ranging from 3.0 to 4.5 Msun located at the clump, which implies a\ndegeneracy of their evolutionary status between subgiant/red giant branch and\ncore helium burning phases. The atmospheres of a large proportion of WGB stars\n(more than 50%) exhibit lithium abundances A(Li) \\geq 1.4 dex similar to\nLi-rich K giants. The position of WGB stars along with the Li-rich K giants in\nthe H-R diagram however indicates that both are well separated groups. The\ncombined and tentatively consistent analysis of the abundance pattern for\nlithium, carbon and nitrogen of WGB stars seems to indicate that carbon\nunderabundance could be decorrelated from the lithium and nitrogen\noverabundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 17:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This is the most precise measurement of the ZZ\nproduction cross section in 1.96 TeV pp collisions to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 17:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The aim of this work is to examine the nature of planetary\nsystems that arise from oligarchic growth in such discs. We adapt the\ncommonly-used Mercury-6 symplectic integrator by including simple prescriptions\nfor planetary migration (types I and II), planetary atmospheres that enhance\nthe probability of planetesimal accretion by protoplanets, gas accretion onto\nforming planetary cores, and gas disc dispersal. We perform a suite of\nsimulations for a variety of disc models with power-law surface density and\ntempera- ture profiles, with a focus on models in which unsaturated corotation\ntorques can drive outward migration of protoplanets. In some models we account\nfor the quenching of corotation torques that arises when planetary orbits\nbecome eccentric. Approximately half of our simulations lead to the successful\nformation of gas giant planets with a broad range of masses and semimajor axes.\n  We conclude that convergent migration induced by corotation torques operating\nduring planet formation can enhance the growth rate of planetary cores, but\nthese often migrate into the central star because corotation torques saturate.\nOutward migration of planetary cores of modest mass can lead to the formation\nof gas giant planets at large distances from the central star, similar to those\nobserved recently through direct imaging surveys.

In the massless limit,\nthe classical DVG theory can be exactly solved for a rather general coupling\ndepending only on the field tensor and the dilaton. We show that the vecton\nfield can be consistently replaced by a new effectively massive scalar field\n(scalaron) with an unusual coupling to dilaton gravity (DSG).

These\nare very strong restrictions on the mediation of supersymmetry breaking in the\nMSSM, and suggest that if the Higgs truly is at 125 GeV, viable models of\ngauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking are reduced to small corners of parameter\nspace or must incorporate new Higgs-sector physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 23:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The\ndetection of narrow Halpha emission reveals star formation in the quasar host\ngalaxy, with SFR=100 Msun/yr. However, the star formation is not distributed\nuniformly, but is strongly suppressed in the region with the highest outflow\nvelocity and highest velocity dispersion. This result indicates that star\nformation in this region is strongly quenched by the quasar outflow, which is\ncleaning the galaxy disk of its molecular gas. This is one of the first direct\nobservational proofs of quasar feedback quenching the star formation at high\nredshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 23:12:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 00:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Reduced models of the voltage sensor (VS) of Kv channels produce\ninsight into the electrostatic physics underlying the response of the highly\npositively charged S4 transmembrane domain to changes in membrane potential and\nother electrostatic parameters. By calculating the partition function computed\nfrom the electrostatic energy over translational and/or rotational degrees of\nfreedom, I compute expectations of charge displacement, energetics, probability\ndistributions of translation & rotation and Maxwell stress for arrangements of\nS4 positively charged residues; these computations can then be compared with\nexperimental results to elucidate the role of various putative atomic level\nfeatures of the VS. A `paddle' model is rejected on electrostatic grounds,\nowing to unfavorable energetics, insufficient charge displacement and excessive\nMaxwell stress. On the other hand, a `sliding helix' model with three local\ncounter-charges, a protein dielectric coefficient of 4 and a 2/3 interval of\ncounter-charge positioning relative to the S4-helix period of positive residues\nis electrostatically reasonable, comparing well with Shaker (Seoh et al.,\n1996). Lack of counter-charges destabilizes the S4 in the membrane;\ncounter-charge interval helps determine the number and shape of energy barriers\nand troughs over the range of motion of the S4; and the local dielectric\ncoefficient of the protein constrains the height of energy maxima. These\n`sliding helix' models compare favorably with experimental results for single &\ndouble mutant charge experiments on Shaker.

The type of manipulation, a \"bear raid,\"\nwould have been prevented by a regulation that was repealed by the Securities\nand Exchange Commission in July 2007. The regulation, the uptick rule, was\ndesigned to prevent manipulation and promote stability and was in force from\n1938 as a key part of the government response to the 1929 market crash and its\naftermath. On November 1, 2007, Citigroup experienced an unusual increase in\ntrading volume and decrease in price. Our analysis of financial industry data\nshows that this decline coincided with an anomalous increase in borrowed\nshares, the selling of which would be a large fraction of the total trading\nvolume. The selling of borrowed shares cannot be explained by news events as\nthere is no corresponding increase in selling by share owners. A similar number\nof shares were returned on a single day six days later. The magnitude and\ncoincidence of borrowing and returning of shares is evidence of a concerted\neffort to drive down Citigroup's stock price and achieve a profit, i.e., a bear\nraid. Interpretations and analyses of financial markets should consider the\npossibility that the intentional actions of individual actors or coordinated\ngroups can impact market behavior. Markets are not sufficiently transparent to\nreveal even major market manipulation events. Our results point to the need for\nregulations that prevent intentional actions that cause markets to deviate from\nequilibrium and contribute to crashes. Enforcement actions cannot reverse\nsevere damage to the economic system.

This problem is non-convex and its optimal\nsolution remains unsolved.

The solution to each sub-problem is optimal and\nunique, thus the convergence of the iterative algorithm is guaranteed.\nSecondly, we propose a structured precoding design to lower the computational\ncomplexity. The proposed precoding structure is able to parallelize the\nchannels in the multiple access (MAC) phase and broadcast (BC) phase. It thus\nreduces the precoding design to a simple power allocation problem. Lastly, for\nthe special case where only a single data stream is transmitted from each\nsource node, we present a source-antenna-selection (SAS) based precoding design\nalgorithm. This algorithm selects only one antenna for transmission from each\nsource and thus requires lower signalling overhead. Comprehensive simulation is\nconducted to evaluate the effectiveness of all the proposed precoding designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 02:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Future wide-field surveys will\ncover both wide and deep regions of the sky and thus require a simultaneous\ntreatment of the spherical sky and of an extended radial coverage. The\nSpherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) decomposition is a natural basis for the\nanalysis of fields in this geometry and facilitates the combination of BAO\nsurveys with other cosmological probes readily described in this basis. We\npresent here a new way to analyse BAOs by studying the BAO wiggles from the SFB\npower spectrum. In SFB space, the power spectrum generally has both a radial\n(k) and tangential (l) dependence and so do the BAOs. In the deep survey limit\nand ignoring evolution, the SFB power spectrum becomes radial and reduces to\nthe Cartesian Fourier power spectrum. In the limit of a thin shell, all the\ninformation is contained in the tangential modes described by the 2D SH power\nspectrum. We find that the radialisation of the SFB power spectrum is still a\ngood approximation even when considering an evolving and biased galaxy field\nwith a finite selection function. This effect can be observed by all-sky\nsurveys with depths comparable to current surveys. We find that the BAOs\nradialise more rapidly than the full SFB power spectrum. Our results suggest\nthe first peak of the BAOs in SFB space becomes radial out to l ~ 10 for\nall-sky surveys with the same depth as SDSS or 2dF, and out to l ~ 70 for an\nall-sky stage IV survey. Subsequent BAO peaks also become radial, but for\nshallow surveys these may be in the non-linear regime. For modes that have\nbecome radial, measurements at different l's are useful in practice to reduce\nmeasurement errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 02:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2012 10:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

For a boundary layer that is thin compared to the radius of the\nstar, the shear rate is much larger than the orbital frequency.

Because of the\nshort cooling time of the gamma-ray emitting electrons, the gamma-ray emission\nzone is in the immediate vicinity of the acceleration site. The particle\nacceleration likely occurs at the termination shock of the relativistic striped\nwind, where multiple forced magnetic field reconnections provide strong\nmagnetic fluctuations facilitating Fermi acceleration processes. The\nacceleration mechanisms imply the presence of stochastic magnetic fields in the\nparticle acceleration region, which cause stochastic variability of the\nsynchrotron emission. This variability is particularly strong in the steep\ngamma-ray tail of the spectrum, where modest fluctuations of the magnetic field\nlead to strong flares of spectral flux. In particular, stochastic variations of\nmagnetic field, which may lead to quasi-cyclic gamma-ray flares, can be\nproduced by the relativistic cyclotron ion instability at the termination\nshock. Our model calculations of the spectral and temporal evolution of\nsynchrotron emission in the spectral cut-off regime demonstrate that the\nintermittent magnetic field concentrations dominate the gamma-ray emission from\nhighest energy electrons and provide fast, strong variability even for a\nquasi-steady distribution of radiating particles.

In habitats that remain stable over many\ngenerations, stabilizing selection reduces trait differences within\npopulations, thereby appearing to remove the diversity needed for heritable\nadaptive responses in new environments. Paradoxically, field studies have\ndocumented numerous populations under long periods of stabilizing selection and\nevolutionary stasis that have rapidly evolved under changed environmental\nconditions. In this article, we review how cryptic genetic variation (CGV)\nresolves this diversity paradox by allowing populations in a stable environment\nto gradually accumulate hidden genetic diversity that is revealed as trait\ndifferences when environments change. Instead of being in conflict,\nenvironmental stasis supports CGV accumulation and thus appears to facilitate\nrapid adaptation in new environments as suggested by recent CGV studies.\nSimilarly, degeneracy has been found to support both genetic and non-genetic\nadaptation at many levels of biological organization. Degenerate, as opposed to\ndiverse or redundant, ensembles appear functionally redundant in certain\nenvironmental contexts but functionally diverse in others. CGV and degeneracy\nparadigms for adaptation are integrated in this review, revealing a common set\nof principles that support adaptation at multiple levels of biological\norganization. Though a discussion of simulation studies, molecular-based\nexperimental systems, principles from population genetics, and field\nexperiments, we demonstrate that CGV and degeneracy reflect complementary\ntop-down and bottom-up, respectively, conceptualizations of the same basic\nphenomenon and arguably capture a universal feature of biological adaptive\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 04:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-15"}

In addition, directly\nrelated morphological quantities such as ellipticity or prolateness are\nessential tools in understanding the formation and structural properties of\nhalos, voids, sheets and filaments, their relation with the local environment,\nand the geometrical and dynamical classification of the cosmic web. To date,\nmost analytic work has been focused on Doroshkevich's unconditional formulae\nfor the eigenvalues of the linear tidal field, which neglect the fact that\nhalos (voids) may correspond to maxima (minima) of the density field. I present\nhere new formulae for the constrained eigenvalues of the initial shear field\nassociated with Gaussian statistics, which include the fact that those\neigenvalues are related to regions where the source of the displacement is\npositive (negative): this is achieved by requiring the Hessian matrix of the\ndisplacement field to be positive (negative) definite.

Those historical visual observations allowed inferring\nthe existence of Venus' atmosphere, the bright arc being correctly ascribed to\nthe refraction of light by the outer layers of a dense atmosphere. On June 8th,\n2004, fast photometry based on electronic imaging devices allowed the first\nquantitative analysis of the phenomenon. Several observers used a variety of\nacquisition systems to image the event -- ranging from amateur-sized to\nprofessional telescopes and cameras -- thus collecting for the first time a\nlarge amount of quantitative information on this atmospheric phenomenon.

Existence and regularity of the solution of the deterministic\ncurve-shortening flow is not obvious \\textit{a priori} and is part of our\nresult.

As a result of the many new pulsar discoveries, the gamma-ray\npulsar population is now approaching 100. Some very famous millisecond pulsars\n(MSPs) have also been detected: J1939+2134 (B1937+21), the first MSP ever\ndiscovered, as well as J1959+2048 (B1957+20), the first black widow pulsar\nsystem. These, along with other MSPs such as PSR J0034-0534 and J2214+3000, are\nrare among the pulsar population in that they exhibit nearly phase-aligned\nradio and gamma-ray light curves (LCs). Traditionally, pulsar LCs have been\nmodelled using standard HE models in conjunction with low-altitude conal beam\nradio models. However, a different approach is needed to account for\nphase-aligned LCs. We explored two scenarios: one where both the radio and\ngamma-ray emission originate in the outer magnetosphere, and one where the\nemission comes from near the polar caps (PCs) on the stellar surface. We find\nbest-fit LCs using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for the first\nclass of models. The first scenario seems to be somewhat preferred, as is also\nhinted at by the radio polarization data. This implies that the phase-aligned\nLCs are possibly of caustic origin produced in the outer magnetosphere, in\ncontrast to the usual lower-altitude conal beam radio models. Lastly, we\nconstrain the emission altitudes with typical uncertainties of ~10% of the\nlight cylinder radius. The modelled pulsars are members of a third gamma-ray\nMSP subclass, in addition to two others with non-aligned radio and gamma-ray\nLCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 11:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-15"}

Supernova remnants (SNRs) are thought to be the main source of\nGalactic cosmic rays (CRs) up to the \"knee\" in CR spectrum. During the\nevolution of a SNR, the bulk of the CRs are confined inside the SNR shell. The\nhighest-energy particles leave the system continuously, while the remaining\nadiabatically cooled particles are released when the SNR has expanded\nsufficiently and decelerated so that the magnetic field at the shock is no\nlonger able to confine them. Particles escaping from the parent system may\ninteract with nearby molecular clouds, producing $\\gamma$-rays in the process\nvia pion decay. The soft gamma-ray spectra observed for a number of SNRs\ninteracting with molecular clouds, however, challenge current theories of\nnon-linear particle acceleration that predict harder spectra. Aims. We study\nhow the spectrum of escaped particles depends on the time-dependent\nacceleration history in both Type Ia and core-collapse SNRs, as well as on\ndifferent assumptions about the diffusion coefficient in the vicinity of the\nSNR.

In most cases, it\nis believed that the post-Newtonian expansion is asymptotically divergent. A\nstandard technique for accelerating the convergence of a power series is to\nre-sum the series by means of a rational polynomial called a Pad\\'e\napproximation. If we liken this approximation to a matrix, the best convergence\nis achieved by staying close to a diagonal Pad\\'e approximation. This broadly\npresents two subsets of the approximation : a super-diagonal approximation\n$P^M_N$ and a sub-diagonal approximation $P_M^N$, where $M = N+\\epsilon$, and\n$\\epsilon$ takes the values of 0 or 1. Left as rational polynomials, the\ncoefficients in both the numerator and denominator need to be re-calculated as\nthe order of the initial power series approximation is increased. However, the\nsub-diagonal Pad\\'e approximant is computationally advantageous as it can be\nexpressed in terms of a Gauss-like continued fraction. Once in this form, each\ncoefficient in the continued fraction is uniquely determined at each order.\nThis means that as we increase the order of approximation of the original power\nseries, we now have only one new additional coefficient to calculate in the\ncontinued fraction. While it is possible to provide explicit expressions for\nthe continued fraction coefficients, they rapidly become unwieldy at high\norders of approximation. It is also possible to numerically calculate the\ncoefficients by means of ratios of Hankel determinants. However, these\ndeterminants can be ill-conditioned and lead to numerical instabilities. In\nthis article, we present a method for calculating the continued fraction\ncoefficients at arbitrary orders of approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 14:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-15"}

The cumulant-periodized self-energy seems to be\nclose to its thermodynamic limit already for a 16-site cluster in the range of\nparameters studied. The 4-site results remarkably agree well with the 16-site\nresults, indicating that the previous studies based on the 4-site cluster\ncapture the essence of the physics of doped Mott insulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 14:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2011 13:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-10"}

It partly relies on\nthe fact that present levels of northern summer incoming solar radiation are\nclose to those that, in the past, preceded a glacial inception phenomenon,\nassociated to declines in greenhouse gas concentrations. However, experiments\nwith various numerical models of glacial cycles show that next glacial\ninception may still be delayed by several ten thousands of years, even with the\nassumption of greenhouse gas concentration declines during the Holocene.\nFurthermore, as we show here, conceptual models designed to capture the gross\ndynamics of the climate system as a whole suggest also that small disturbances\nmay sometimes cause substantial delays in glacial events, causing a fair level\nof unpredictability on ice age dynamics. This suggests the need of a validated\nmathematical description of the climate system dynamics that allows us to\nquantify uncertainties on predictions. Here, it is proposed to organise our\nknowledge about the physics and dynamics of glacial cycles through a Bayesian\ninference network. Constraints on the physics and dynamics of climate can be\nencapsulated into a stochastic dynamical system. These constraints include, in\nparticular, estimates of the sensitivity of the components of climate to\nexternal forcings, inferred from plans of experiments with large simulators of\nthe atmosphere, oceans and ice sheets. On the other hand, palaeoclimate\nobservations are accounted for through a process of parameter calibration.

Reproducing them is a challenge for proposed ejection models. We\nexplore whether molecules may survive in an MHD disk wind invoked to reproduce\nthe kinematics and tentative rotation signatures of atomic jets in T Tauri\nstars. The coupled ionization, chemical and thermal evolution along dusty flow\nstreamlines is computed for a prescribed MHD disk wind solution, using a method\ndeveloped for magnetized shocks in the interstellar medium. Irradiation by\nwind-attenuated coronal X-rays and FUV photons from accretion hot spots is\nincluded, with self-shielding of H2 and CO. Disk accretion rates of 5e-6, 1e-6\nand 1e-7 solar masses per year are considered, representative of low-mass young\nprotostars (Class 0), evolved protostars (Class I) and very active T Tauri\nstars (Class II). The disk wind has an onion-like thermo-chemical structure,\nwith streamlines launched from larger radii having lower temperature and\nionisation, and higher H2 abundance. The coupling between charged and neutral\nfluids is sufficient to eject molecules from the disk out to 9 AU. The launch\nradius beyond which most H2 survives moves outward with evolutionary stage. CO\nsurvives in the Class 0 but is significantly photodissociated in the Class\nI/II. Balance between ambipolar heating and molecular cooling establishes an\nasymptotic temperature 700-3000 K, with cooler jets at earlier protostellar\nstages. Endothermic formation of H2O is efficient with abundances up to 1e-4,\nwhile CH+ and SH+ can exceed 1e-6 in the Class I/II winds. A centrifugal MHD\ndisk wind launched from beyond 0.2-1 AU can produce molecular jets/winds up to\nspeeds 100 km/s in young low-mass stars. The model predicts a high ratio H2/CO\nand an increase of molecular launch radius, temperature, and flow width as the\nsource evolves, in agreement with current observed trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 15:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-15"}

Furthermore, unlike nonspatial CR methods, SCR models account for\nheterogeneity in capture probability arising from the juxtaposition of animal\nactivity centers and sample locations. Although the utility of SCR methods is\ngaining recognition, the requirement that all individuals can be uniquely\nidentified excludes their use in many contexts. In this paper, we develop\nmodels for situations in which individual recognition is not possible, thereby\nallowing SCR concepts to be applied in studies of unmarked or partially marked\npopulations. The data required for our model are spatially referenced counts\nmade on one or more sample occasions at a collection of closely spaced sample\nunits such that individuals can be encountered at multiple locations. Our\napproach includes a spatial point process for the animal activity centers and\nuses the spatial correlation in counts as information about the number and\nlocation of the activity centers. Camera-traps, hair snares, track plates,\nsound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially correlated count\ndata, and thus our model is widely applicable. A simulation study demonstrated\nthat while the posterior mean exhibits frequentist bias on the order of 5-10%\nin small samples, the posterior mode is an accurate point estimator as long as\nadequate spatial correlation is present. Marking a subset of the population\nsubstantially increases posterior precision and is recommended whenever\npossible. We applied our model to avian point count data collected on an\nunmarked population of the northern parula (Parula americana) and obtained a\ndensity estimate (posterior mode) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19-1.64) birds/ha.

This is done in Theorems2,3, and4 respectively. We also find\nthree different families of solutions to equation (5); listed in Theorem5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 19:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

More than ninety per cent of smaller REB events can\nbe built in automatic processing while completely fitting the REB event\ndefinition criteria. The rate of false alarms, as compared to the events\nrejected from the SEL3 in the current interactive processing, has also been\ndramatically reduced by several powerful filters. The principal filter is the\ndifference of arrival times between the master events and newly built events at\nthree or more primary stations, which should lie in a narrow range of a few\nseconds. Two effective pre-filters are f-k analysis and Fprob based on\ncorrelation traces instead of original waveforms. As a result, cross\ncorrelation may reduce the overall workload related to IDC interactive analysis\nand provide a precise tool for quality check for both arrivals and events. Some\nmajor improvements in automatic and interactive processing achieved by cross\ncorrelation are illustrated by an aftershock sequence of a large continental\nearthquake. Exploring this sequence, we describe schematically the next steps\nfor the development of a processing pipeline parallel to the existing IDC one\nin order to improve the quality of the REB together with the reduction of the\nmagnitude threshold. The current IDC processing pipeline should be focused on\nthe events in areas without historical seismicity which are not properly\ncovered by REB events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 09:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

The peculiar trajectories of\nthe bead at different speeds of rotation of the hoop are presented. Phase\nportraits and nature of fixed points are studied. Bifurcation is observed with\nchange in the rotational speed of the hoop. At a critical speed of rotation of\nthe hoop, there appears an interesting relation between the time period and\namplitude of oscillation of the bead. The study introduces several important\naspects of nonlinear dynamics.
