In our algorithm, we assume\nthat each agent has access only to a local (myopic) view of the network around\nit. In each iteration, agents in the network peform a decentralized decision\nprocess to determine the edge addition/deletion that minimizes a distance\nfunction defined in the space of eigenvalue spectra. This spectral distance\npresents interesting theoretical properties that allow an efficient distributed\nimplementation of the decision process. Our iterative algorithm is stable by\nconstruction, i.e., locally optimizes the network's eigenvalue spectrum, and is\nshown to perform extremely well in practice. We illustrate our results with\nnontrivial simulations in which we design networks matching the spectral\nproperties of complex networks, such as small-world and power-law networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2011 16:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 13:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-10"}

These counting type instruments have a field of view of\nfew degrees in diameter and record large numbers of particle air showers via\ntheir Cherenkov radiation in the atmosphere. The showers are either induced by\ngamma rays or diffuse cosmic ray background. The commonly used test statistic\nto evaluate a possible gamma-ray excess is Li and Ma (1983), Eq. 17, which can\nbe applied to independent on- and off-source observations, or scenarios that\ncan be approximated as such. This formula however is unsuitable if the data are\ntaken in so-called \"wobble\" mode (pointing to several offset positions around\nthe source), if at the same time the acceptance shape is irregular or even\ndepends on operating parameters such as the pointing direction or telescope\nmultiplicity. To provide a robust test statistic in such cases, this paper\nexplores a possible generalization of the likelihood ratio concept on which the\nformula of Li and Ma is based. In doing so, the multi-pointing nature of the\ndata and the typically known instrument point spread function are fully\nexploited to derive a new, semi-numerical test statistic. Due to its\nflexibility and robustness against systematic uncertainties, it is not only\nuseful for detection purposes, but also for skymapping and source shape\nfitting. Simplified Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the\nresults, and several applications and further generalizations of the concept\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2011 18:48:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 13:19:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 07:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 18:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-08"}

Is such a solution necessarily close to the true sparsest solution? More\ngenerally, is it possible to construct an upper bound on the estimation error\n||s_hat-s0||_2 without knowing s0? The answer is positive, and in this paper we\nconstruct such a bound based on minimal singular values of submatrices of A.

Despite the already substantial amount of work done in\nthis area to date by researchers from various disciplines, however, there\nremain many questions of a decidedly foundational nature - natural analogues of\nstandard questions already posed and addressed in more classical areas of\nstatistics - that have yet to even be posed, much less addressed. Here we raise\nand consider one such question in connection with network modeling.\nSpecifically, we ask, \"Given an observed network, what is the sample size?\"\nUsing simple, illustrative examples from the class of exponential random graph\nmodels, we show that the answer to this question can very much depend on basic\nproperties of the networks expected under the model, as the number of vertices\n$n_V$ in the network grows. In particular, adopting the (asymptotic) scaling of\nthe variance of the maximum likelihood parameter estimates as a notion of\neffective sample size ($n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$), we show that when modeling the\noverall propensity to have ties and the propensity to reciprocate ties, whether\nthe networks are sparse or not under the model (i.e., having a constant or an\nincreasing number of ties per vertex, respectively) is sufficient to yield an\norder of magnitude difference in $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, from $O(n_V)$ to\n$O(n^2_V)$. In addition, we report simulation study results that suggest\nsimilar properties for models for triadic (friend-of-a-friend) effects. We then\nexplore some practical implications of this result, using both simulation and\ndata on food-sharing from Lamalera, Indonesia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 05:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 04:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2012 23:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 06:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

In the study of efficient reasoning over\nmassive graphs, the notion of node bisimilarity plays a central role. For\nexample, grouping together bisimilar nodes in an XML data set is the first step\nin many sophisticated approaches to building indexing data structures for\nefficient XPath query evaluation. To date, however, only internal-memory\nbisimulation algorithms have been investigated. As the size of real-world DAG\ndata sets often exceeds available main memory, storage in external memory\nbecomes necessary. Hence, there is a practical need for an efficient approach\nto computing bisimulation in external memory.\n  Our general algorithm has a worst-case IO-complexity of O(Sort(|N| + |E|)),\nwhere |N| and |E| are the numbers of nodes and edges, resp., in the data graph\nand Sort(n) is the number of accesses to external memory needed to sort an\ninput of size n. We also study specializations of this algorithm to common\nvariations of bisimulation for tree-structured XML data sets. We empirically\nverify efficient performance of the algorithms on graphs and XML documents\nhaving billions of nodes and edges, and find that the algorithms can process\nsuch graphs efficiently even when very limited internal memory is available.\nThe proposed algorithms are simple enough for practical implementation and use,\nand open the door for further study of external-memory bisimulation algorithms.\nTo this end, the full open-source C++ implementation has been made freely\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 08:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

These are defined on a Hill's type vortex where the\nflow is rotating and swirling at the same time, inducing the flux to spiraling\nat a central node. Despite the appearance, the solution still remains very\nregular at the agglomeration point. The analysis may lead to a better\nunderstanding of the subtle problem of characterizing the solution space of the\n3D Navier-Stokes equations. For instance, this result makes more narrow the\npath to the search of counterexamples built on the stretching and twisting of\nvortex tubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 10:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}

Here we present the\nfirst steps toward the characterisation of the white dwarfs and the donor stars\nin these VY Scl systems in the low state, and the discovery of sporadic\naccretion events and satellite emission lines like those observed in the AM Her\nsystems in the low state, which are likely related to magnetic activity of the\nfast rotating secondary stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 12:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}

Our study focuses on two aspects, consistency and\ncomputation. We prove that the sparse estimator from such a method can retain\nall of the important variables asymptotically for even exponentially growing\ndimensionality under regularity conditions. This indicates that the best subset\nregression method can efficiently shrink the full model down to a submodel of a\nsize less than the sample size, which can be analyzed by well-developed\nregression techniques for such cases in a follow-up study. We provide an\niterative algorithm, called orthogonalizing subset selection (OSS), to address\ncomputational issues in best subset regression.

Our goal is to predict\naccurate mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities. These quantities can be\ncompared to empirical values, thereby testing radiation-driven wind models. One\nspecific issue is that of the \"weak-wind problem\", where empirically derived\nmass-loss rates fall orders of magnitude short of predicted values. We employ\nan established Monte Carlo model and a recently suggested new line acceleration\nformalism to solve the wind dynamics consistently. We provide a new grid of\nmass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of O stars, and compare the values\nto empirical results. Our models fail to provide mass-loss rates for\nmain-sequence stars below a luminosity of log(L/Lsun) = 5.2, where we run into\na fundamental limit. At luminosities below this critical value there is\ninsufficient momentum transferred in the region below the sonic point to\nkick-start the acceleration. This problem occurs at the location of the onset\nof the weak-wind problem. For O dwarfs, the boundary between being able to\nstart a wind, and failing to do so, is at spectral type O6/O6.5. The direct\ncause of this failure is a combination of the lower luminosity and a lack of Fe\nV lines at the wind base. This might indicate that another mechanism is\nrequired to provide the necessary driving to initiate the wind. For stars more\nluminous than log(L/Lsun) = 5.2, our new mass-loss rates are in excellent\nagreement with the mass-loss prescription by Vink et al. 2000. This implies\nthat the main assumption entering the method of the Vink et al. prescriptions -\ni.e. that the momentum equation is not explicitly solved for - does not\ncompromise the reliability of the Vink et al. results for this part of\nparameter space (Abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 14:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
