From period-to-period fits we found an\nasteroseismological model characterized by an effective temperature much higher\nthan the spectroscopic estimate. In agreement with a recent asteroseismological\nanalysis of this star by other authors, we conclude that KIC 8626021 is located\nnear the blue edge of the DBV instability strip, contrarily to spectroscopic\npredictions. We also conclude that the mass of KIC 8626021 should be\nsubstantially larger than thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2011 19:07:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2011 02:29:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 02:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This chain model involves the nearest-neighbor interaction of a\nMorse-like potential (required to have a saturation branch) and an harmonic\nsecond-neighbor coupling. Under an external stretching applied t o the chain\nends, the intersite Morse-like potential results in the appearance of a\ndouble-well potential within each chain monomer, whereas the interaction\nbetween the second neighbors provide s a homogeneous bistable (degenerate)\nground state, at least within a certain part of the chain.\n  As a result, different conformational changes occur in the chain under the\nexternal forcing. The transition regions between these conformations are\ndescribed as topological solitons. With a strong second-neighbor interaction,\nthe solitons describe the transition between the bistable ground states.\nHowever, the key point of the model is the appearance of a heterogenous\nstructure, when the second-neighbor coupling is sufficiently weak. In this\ncase, a part of the chain has short bonds with a single-well potential, whereas\nthe complementary part admits strongly stretched bonds with a double-well\npotential.

In both the d-wave superconducting\n(dSC) and the pseudogap (PG) phases of underdoped cuprates, two distinct\nclasses of electronic states are observed using SI-STM. The first class\nconsists of the dispersive Bogoliubov quasiparticles of a homogeneous d-wave\nsuperconductor. These are detected below a lower energy scale |E|={\\Delta}0 and\nonly upon a momentum space (k-space) arc which terminates near the lines\nconnecting k=\\pm({\\pi}/a0,0) to k=\\pm(0, {\\pi}/a0). In both the dSC and PG\nphases, the only broken symmetries detected in the |E|\\leq {\\Delta}0 states are\nthose of a d-wave superconductor. The second class of states occurs at energies\nnear the pseudogap energy scale |E| {\\Delta}1 which is associated\nconventionally with the 'antinodal' states near k=\\pm({\\pi}/a0,0) and k=\\pm(0,\n{\\pi}/a0). We find that these states break the 90o-rotational (C4) symmetry of\nelectronic structure within CuO2 unit cells, at least down to 180o rotational\n(C2) symmetry (nematic) but in a spatially disordered fashion. This\nintra-unit-cell C4 symmetry breaking coexists at |E| {\\Delta}1 with\nincommensurate conductance modulations locally breaking both rotational and\ntranslational symmetries (smectic). The properties of these two classes of |E|\n{\\Delta}1 states are indistinguishable in the dSC and PG phases.

Yet, because it is difficult to directly\nmeasure mechanical stress {\\it in vivo} on sub-cellular scale, little is\nunderstood about the role of mechanics of development. Here we present an\nalternative approach which takes advantage of the recent progress in live\nimaging of morphogenetic processes and uses computational analysis of high\nresolution images of epithelial tissues to infer relative magnitude of forces\nacting within and between cells. We model intracellular stress in terms of bulk\npressure and interfacial tension, allowing these parameters to vary from cell\nto cell and from interface to interface. Assuming that epithelial cell layers\nare close to mechanical equilibrium, we use the observed geometry of the two\ndimensional cell array to infer interfacial tensions and intracellular\npressures.

The analysis reveals mechanical anisotropy in the former process and\nmechanical heterogeneity, correlated with cell differentiation, in the latter\nprocess. The method opens a way for quantitative and detailed experimental\ntests of models of cell and tissue mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2011 01:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The stilbene\nscintillator has been proposed for use as a neutron diagnostic system to\nmeasure the characteristics of neutrons from the Korea Superconducting Tokamak\nAdvanced Research (KSTAR) fusion reactor. Specially designed electronics are\nnecessary to measure fast neutron spectra with high radiation from a gamma-ray\nbackground. The signals from neutrons and gamma-rays are discriminated by the\ndigital charge pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method, which uses total to\npartial charge ratio analysis. The signals are digitized by a flash\nanalog-to-digital convertor (FADC). To evaluate the performance of the\nfabricated stilbene neutron diagnostic system, the efficiency of 10 mm\nsoft-iron magnetic shielding and the detection efficiency of fast neutrons were\ntested experimentally using a 252Cf neutron source. In the results, the\ndesigned and fabricated stilbene neutron diagnostic system performed well in\ndiscriminating neutrons from gamma-rays under the high magnetic field\nconditions during KSTAR operation.

We determine the gas-phase heavy\nelement abundances of six galaxies in Pegasus derived from H II region spectra\nobtained from integral-field spectroscopy. These abundances are analyzed in the\ncontext of Virgo, whose spirals are known to show increasing interstellar\nmetallicity as a function of H I deficiency. The galaxies in the Pegasus\ncluster, despite its lower density and velocity dispersion, also display gas\nloss due to ISM-ICM interaction, albeit to a lesser degree. Based on the\nabundances of 3 H I deficient spirals and 2 H I normal spirals, we observe a\nheavy element abundance offset of +0.13\\pm0.07 dex for the H I deficient\ngalaxies. This abundance differential is consistent with the differential\nobserved in Virgo for galaxies with a similar H I deficiency, and we observe a\ncorrelation between log(O/H) and the H I deficiency parameter DEF for the two\nclusters analyzed together. Our results suggest that similar environmental\nmechanisms are driving the heavy element enhancement in both clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2011 15:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Rather, energy-dependent corrections beyond the scattering length\napproximation are required, indicating a resonance with an anomalously large\neffective range. For fields where the molecular state is above threshold, the\nrate of three-body recombination is enhanced by a sharp, two-body resonance\narising from the closed-channel molecular state which can be magnetically tuned\nthrough the continuum. This narrow resonance can be used to study strongly\ncorrelated Fermi gases that simultaneously have a sizeable effective range and\na large scattering length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2011 15:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The detection algorithm assumes that local optima are points which are\neasier to reach and harder to leave by a slow adaptive walker. A slow adaptive\nwalker moves to a nearest fitter point. Thus, points with larger outgoing step\nsizes relative to incoming step sizes are marked using the local optima score\nformulae as potential local optima points (PLOPs). Defining local optima in\nthese more general terms allows their detection within the closure of a subset\nof a search space, and the sampling of a search space unshackled by a\nparticular move set. Tests are done with NK and HIFF problems to confirm that\nPLOPs detected in the manner proposed retain characteristics of local optima,\nand that the adjusted Wang-Landau samples are more representative of the search\nspace than samples produced by choosing points uniformly at random.
