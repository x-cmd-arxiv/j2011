In all these adiabatic theorems the considered spectral\nvalues need not lie on the imaginary axis and in the adiabatic theorems with\nspectral gap condition and the adiabatic theorem of higher order compact\nsubsets of the spectrum are sufficient (in particular, these subsets need not\nconsist of eigenvalues).

The discovery and the characterization\nof the youngest SB will allow us to infer the mechanisms and timescales\ninvolved in their formation. Our work aims to find spectroscopic companions\naround young stellar objects (YSO). We present a near-IR high-resolution (R ~\n60000) multi-epoch radial velocity survey of 7 YSO in the star forming region\n(SFR) rho-Ophiuchus. The radial velocities of each source were derived using a\ntwo-dimensional cross-correlation function, using the zero-point established by\nthe Earth's atmosphere as reference. More than 14 spectral lines in the CO\n(0-2) bandhead window were used in the cross-correlation against LTE\natmospheric models to compute the final results. We found that the spectra of\nthe protostars in our sample agree well with the predicted stellar photospheric\nprofiles, indicating that the radial velocities derived are indeed of stellar\nnature. Three of the targets analyzed exhibit large radial velocity variations\nduring the three observation epochs. These objects - pending further\nconfirmation and orbital characteristics - may become the first evidence for\nproto-spectroscopic binaries, and will provide important constraints on their\nformation.

We study\nmulti-round sponsored search auctions, where the different rounds are linked\nthrough the budget constraints of the bidders and the valuation of a bidder for\nall rounds is the sum of the valuations for the individual rounds. All\nmechanisms published so far either study one-round sponsored search auctions or\nthe setting where every round has only one slot and all slots have the same\nclick-through rate, which is identical to a multi-item auction.\n  This paper contains the following three results: (1) We give the first\nmechanism for the multi-round sponsored search problem where different slots\nhave different click-through rates. Our mechanism is incentive compatible in\nexpectation, individually rational in expectation, Pareto optimal in\nexpectation, and also ex-post Pareto optimal for each realized outcome.

One is facilitated by the fluid vorticity generated by the ``rippled\"\nshock front interacting with the background turbulence. The resulting turbulent\nflow keeps amplifying the magnetic field, consistent with earlier work\n\\citep{Giacalone2007}. The other process is facilitated by the growth of the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability at the contact discontinuity between the ejecta and\nthe shocked medium. This can efficiently amplify the magnetic field and tends\nto produce the highest magnetic field. We investigate the dependence of the\namplification on numerical parameters such as grid-cell size and on various\nphysical parameters. We show the magnetic field has a characteristic radial\nprofile that the downstream magnetic field gets progressively stronger away\nfrom the shock. This is because the downstream magnetic field needs a finite\ntime to reach the efficient amplification, and will get further amplified in\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor region. In our simulation we do not observe a systematic\nstrong magnetic field within a small distance to the shock. This indicates that\nif the magnetic-field amplification in supernova remnants indeed occurs near\nthe shock front, other processes such as three-dimensional instabilities,\nplasma kinetics and/or cosmic ray effect may need to be considered to explain\nthe strong magnetic field in supernova remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 18:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which\nwe simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a\ndifferent view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning\nproblems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifold\nalgorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each\nview allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way\nthat an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a {linear}\ndimensionality reduction problem.

We equip players with the\nparticle swarm optimization technique, and find that it may lead to highly\ncooperative states even if the temptations to defect are strong. The concept of\nparticle swarm optimization was originally introduced within a simple model of\nsocial dynamics that can describe the formation of a swarm, i.e., analogous to\na swarm of bees searching for a food source. Essentially, particle swarm\noptimization foresees changes in the velocity profile of each player, such that\nthe best locations are targeted and eventually occupied. In our case, each\nplayer keeps track of the highest payoff attained within a local topological\nneighborhood and its individual highest payoff. Thus, players make use of their\nown memory that keeps score of the most profitable strategy in previous\nactions, as well as use of the knowledge gained by the swarm as a whole, to\nfind the best available strategy for themselves and the society. Following\nextensive simulations of this setup, we find a significant increase in the\nlevel of cooperation for a wide range of parameters, and also a full resolution\nof the prisoner's dilemma. We also demonstrate extreme efficiency of the\noptimization algorithm when dealing with environments that strongly favor the\nproliferation of defection, which in turn suggests that swarming could be an\nimportant phenomenon by means of which cooperation can be sustained even under\nhighly unfavorable conditions.

Electromagnetic effects are thought to be a\nprime suspect, but details still need an explanation. To this end, we study a\nthree-dimensional structure of oblique magnetic fields near a rotating black\nhole in vacuum. It has been proposed that such a set-up can lead to efficient\nacceleration when plasma is injected near a magnetic null point. We focus our\nattention especially on the magnetic field in the immediate neighborhood of the\nmagnetic null point, which was previously shown to occur in the equatorial\nplane. By employing the Line-Integral-Convolution (LIC) method, we visualize\nthe magnetic field lines and explore the electric lines rising out of the\nequatorial plane. We show the magnetic field structure near the boundary of\nergosphere, depending on the spin of the black hole. Electric field develops a\nnon-vanishing component passing through the magnetic null point and ensuring\nefficient acceleration of charged particles from this particular location near\nhorizon. We also examine the effect of translatory boost on the field lines.\nSimilarly to the frame-dragging by rotation, the linear motion carries field\nlines along with the black hole.

There is\nconsiderable hope that a confirmed GRB detection will be possible with the\nupcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), which will have a larger effective\narea and better low-energy sensitivity than current-generation imaging\natmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). To estimate the likelihood of such a\ndetection, we have developed a phenomenological model for GRB emission between\n1 GeV and 1 TeV that is motivated by the high-energy GRB detections of\nFermi-LAT, and allows us to extrapolate the statistics of GRBs seen by lower\nenergy instruments such as the Swift-BAT and BATSE on the Compton Gamma-ray\nObservatory. We show a number of statistics for detected GRBs, and describe how\nthe detectability of GRBs with CTA could vary based on a number of parameters,\nsuch as the typical observation delay between the burst onset and the start of\nground observations. We also consider the possibility of using GBM on Fermi as\na finder of GRBs for rapid ground follow-up. While the uncertainty of GBM\nlocalization is problematic, the small field-of-view for IACTs can potentially\nbe overcome by scanning over the GBM error region. Overall, our results\nindicate that CTA should be able to detect one GRB every 20 to 30 months with\nour baseline instrument model, assuming consistently rapid pursuit of GRB\nalerts, and provided that spectral breaks below 100 GeV are not a common\nfeature of the bright GRB population.

We then choose one of the\nBoole inequalities that, as we recall, must be obeyed by collections of\nsequences of normalized spin-1/2 projections onto unit vectors that belong to,\nsay, the plane that is orthogonal to the classical trajectory or to the three\ndimensional space. Next we define the concept of being a-p for i-indexed\nsequences of spin-1/2 particles: it turns out that a sequence of spin-1/2\nparticles is a-p if and only if the particles behave as if they had indeed been\nprepared (in the usual sense) to have definite spins +1 or -1 along the axis a,\nthe sequence of signs being pre-determined. The a-p property is formulated in a\nway abstract enough to let one generalize it and we define the concept of being\na-p and b-p. However, using our chosen Boole inequality we prove that no\nparticle sequence can be both a-p and b-p when a and b are not co-linear. We\nnext consider two modifications of Quantum Mechanics:\n  - The first one by assuming both Weak Realism, the weakest form of Realism\nneeded to develop any main theorem in Bell's Theory, and Locality. - The second\none by assuming Weak Realism and an hypothesis that turns out to be none else\nthan (relativistic) Causality extended to cover as well the observable values\nthat make sense only if one assumes Weak Realism. In both cases we arrive at\nthe conclusion that in the EPRB setting where successive pairs of spin-1/2\nparticles are prepared in the so-called singlet state, one of these particles\nsequences is both a-p and b-p and a and b are the opposite of the vectors\nrespectively used to project the spin of the other particle and to get the\nRealism-based alternate value for a projection.

A rectilinear dual is called a cartogram if the area of\neach region is equal to a pre-specified weight of the corresponding vertex. The\ncomplexity of a cartogram is determined by the maximum number of corners (or\nsides) required for any polygon. In a series of papers the polygonal complexity\nof such representations for maximal planar graphs has been reduced from the\ninitial 40 to 34, then to 12 and very recently to the currently best known 10.\nHere we describe a construction with 8-sided polygons, which is optimal in\nterms of polygonal complexity as 8-sided polygons are sometimes necessary.\nSpecifically, we show how to compute the combinatorial structure and how to\nrefine the representation into an area-universal rectangular layout in linear\ntime. The exact cartogram can be computed from the area-universal rectangular\nlayout with numerical iteration, or can be approximated with a hill-climbing\nheuristic.\n  We also describe an alternative construction for Hamiltonian maximal planar\ngraphs, which allows us to directly compute the cartograms in linear time.\nMoreover, we prove that even for Hamiltonian graphs 8-sided rectilinear\npolygons are necessary, by constructing a non-trivial lower bound example. The\ncomplexity of the cartograms can be reduced to 6 if the Hamiltonian path has\nthe extra property that it is one-legged, as in outer-planar graphs. Thus, we\nhave optimal representations (in terms of both polygonal complexity and running\ntime) for Hamiltonian maximal planar and maximal outer-planar graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2011 05:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-05"}

We call these payoffs\nas localized payoffs. In this game, the payoff of each individual captures (1)\nthe gain from immediate neighbors, (2) the bridging benefits, and (3) the cost\nto form links. This implies that the payoff of each individual can be computed\nusing only its single-hop neighbourhood information. Based on this simple model\nof network formation, our study explores the structure of networks that form,\nsatisfying one or both of the properties, namely, pairwise stability and\nefficiency. We analytically prove the pairwise stability of several interesting\nnetwork structures, notably, the complete bi-partite network, complete\nequi-k-partite network, complete network and cycle network, under various\nconfigurations of the model. We validate and extend these results through\nextensive simulations. We characterize topologies of efficient networks by\ndrawing upon classical results from extremal graph theory and discover that the\nTuran graph (or the complete equi-bi-partite network) is the unique efficient\nnetwork under many configurations of parameters. We examine the tradeoffs\nbetween topologies of pairwise stable networks and efficient networks using the\nnotion of price of stability, which is the ratio of the sum of payoffs of the\nplayers in an optimal pairwise stable network to that of an efficient network.\nInterestingly, we find that price of stability is equal to 1 for almost all\nconfigurations of parameters in the proposed model; and for the rest of the\nconfigurations of the parameters, we obtain a lower bound of 0.5 on the price\nof stability. This leads to another key insight of this paper: under mild\nconditions, efficient networks will form when strategic individuals choose to\nadd or delete links based on only localized payoffs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2011 05:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

This\ncauses the medium to expand locally and emit a shock wave with a\nmedium-dependent peak frequency on the order of 10 kHz. In South Pole ice in\nparticular, the elastic properties of the medium have been theorized to provide\ngood coupling of particle energy to acoustic energy. The acoustic attenuation\nlength has been theorized to be several km, which could enable a sparsely\ninstrumented large-volume detector to search for rare signals from high-energy\nastrophysical neutrinos. We simulated a hybrid optical/radio/acoustic extension\nto the IceCube array, specifically intended to detect cosmogenic (GZK)\nneutrinos with multiple methods simultaneously in order to achieve high\nconfidence in a discovered signal and to measure angular, temporal, and\nspectral distributions of GZK neutrinos.\n  This work motivated the design, deployment, and operation of the South Pole\nAcoustic Test Setup (SPATS).

It\ncan handle loads that are not necessarily rotationally symmetric. Nystrom\ndiscretization is used to discretize the BIEs on the generating curve. The\nquadrature is a high-order Gaussian rule that is modified near the diagonal to\nretain high-order accuracy for singular kernels.

For this, composite spectra with different stellar\nastrophysical parameters were calculated and compared to the observations to\nfind the best fitting combination. HD 210111 comprises two equal (within the\nestimated errors) stars with T(eff)=7400K, logg=3.8dex, [M/H]=-1.0dex and\nvsini=30km/s. This result is in line with other strict observational facts\npublished so far for this object. It is only the third detailed investigated\nlambda Bootis type SB system, but the first one with a known IR-excess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2011 10:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

The Internet of Things (IOT) integrates\nmany technologies, such as Internet, Zigbee, Bluetooth, infrared, WiFi, GPRS,\n3G, etc, which can enable different ways to obtain the location information of\nvarious objects. Location-based service is a primary service of the IOT, while\nlocalization accuracy is a key issue. In this paper, a higher accuracy\nlocalization scheme is proposed which can effectively satisfy diverse\nrequirements for many indoor and outdoor location services. The proposed scheme\ncomposes of two phases: 1) partition phase, in which the target region is split\ninto small grids; 2) localization refinement phase, in which a higher accuracy\nof localization can be obtained by applying an algorithm designed in the paper.\nA trial system is set up to verify correctness of the proposed scheme and\nfurthermore to illustrate its feasibility and availability.

A smaller amount of 109o domain walls\nare also present at the boundaries between two adjacent bundles. All as-grown\ntwin walls display enhanced conductivity with respect to the domains during\nlocal probe measurements, due to the selective lowering of the Schottky barrier\nbetween the film and the AFM tip (see S. Farokhipoor and B. Noheda, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 107, 127601 (2011)). In this paper we further discuss these results and\nshow why other conduction mechanisms are discarded. In addition we show the\ncrucial role that oxygen vacancies play in determining the amount of conduction\nat the walls. This prompts us to propose that the oxygen vacancies migrating to\nthe walls locally lower the Schottky barrier. This mechanism would then be less\nefficient in non-ferroelastic domain walls where one expects no strain\ngradients around the walls and thus (assuming that walls are not charged) no\ndriving force for accumulation of defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2011 15:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-17"}

We also\nshow that the `kinky' nature in the polarization position angle traverses might\nbe due to the rotation and modulation effects. The phase lag of polarization\nposition angle inflection point relative to the phase of core peak also depends\nup on the rotationally induced asymmetry in the curvature of source trajectory\nand modulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2011 06:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To guarantee the\nsecurity of multicast, the group key is used to encrypt and decrypt the\npackages. However, providing key management services in WSNs is complicated\nbecause sensor nodes possess limited resources of computing, storage and\ncommunication. To address the balance between security and limited resources, a\nmulticast group key management protocol based on the weight-balanced 2-3 tree\nis proposed to generate, distribute, and update the group key securely and\nefficiently. The decentralized group key management method is employed. A\nweight-balanced 2-3 key tree is formed in every subgroup. Instead of using the\nconventional symmetric and non-symmetric encryption algorithms, the Maximum\nDistance Separable (MDS) code technique is used to distribute the multicast key\ndynamically. During the key updating, a series of adjustment rules are\nsummarized to keep the tree weight-balanced, where pseudo-nodes as leaves are\nadded to reduce the computation and communication complexity. Compared with\nsome other group key management protocols, our scheme shows higher superiority\non security and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2011 13:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}
