Fractional frequency reuse\n(FFR) is an attractive interference management technique due to its low\ncomplexity and overhead, and significant coverage improvement for\nlow-percentile (cell-edge) users. Instead of relying on system simulations\nbased on deterministic access point locations, this paper instead proposes an\nanalytical model for evaluating Strict FFR and Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR)\ndeployments based on the spatial Poisson point process. Our results both\ncapture the non-uniformity of heterogeneous deployments and produce tractable\nexpressions which can be used for system design with Strict FFR and SFR.

PEV\ncharging stations will most likely be available at home and at work, and\noccasionally be publicly available, offering flexible charging options.\nIdeally, each vehicle will charge during periods when electricity prices are\nrelatively low, to minimize the cost to the consumer and maximize societal\nbenefits. A Demand Response (DR) service for a fleet of PEVs could yield such\ncharging schedules by regulating consumer electricity use during certain time\nperiods, in order to meet an obligation to the market.\n  We construct an automated DR mechanism for a fleet of PEVs that facilitates\nvehicle charging to ensure the demands of the vehicles and the market are met.\nOur dynamic algorithm depends only on the knowledge of a few hundred driving\nbehaviors from a previous similar day, and uses a simple adjusted pricing\nscheme to instantly assign feasible and satisfactory charging schedules to\nthousands of vehicles in a fleet as they plug-in. The charging schedules\ngenerated using our adjusted pricing scheme can ensure that a new demand peak\nis not created and can reduce the consumer cost by over 30% when compared to\nstandard charging, which may also increase peak demand by 3.5%.

Within the present status of this model, however, the model cannot\ndescribe the launch of a self-confined bipolar jet from the vicinity of disk's\ninner edge, although it allows the existence of a thermal wind widely\ndistributed over the disk surfaces. This is because the electric field (and\nhence the Poynting flux) vanishes everywhere in the disk, whereas such a jet in\na globally ordered magnetic field is most likely to be accelerated\nelectrodynamically.

Xue, Phys. Rev. D82 (2010)\n064039] the quantum Einstein-Cartan gravity in the framework of Regge calculus.\nOn the basis of strong coupling expansion, mean-field approximation and\ndynamical equations satisfied by holonomy fields, we present in this Letter\ncalculations and discussions to show the phase structure of the quantum\nEinstein-Cartan gravity, (i) the order phase: long-range condensations of\nholonomy fields in strong gauge couplings; (ii) the disorder phase: short-range\nfluctuations of holonomy fields in weak gauge couplings. According to the\ncompetition of the activation energy of holonomy fields and their entropy, we\ngive a simple estimate of the possible ultra-violet critical point and\ncorrelation length for the second-order phase transition from the order phase\nto disorder one. At this critical point, we discuss whether the continuum field\ntheory of quantum Einstein-Cartan gravity can be possibly approached when the\nmacroscopic correlation length of holonomy field condensations is much larger\nthan the Planck length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2011 19:34:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 15:40:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 17:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
