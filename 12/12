In this paper, the contributions comprise new\ninsights from revisiting tractability aspects of computing optimum. Previous\ncomplexity analyses have been limited by assumptions of fixed power on each\nsubcarrier, or power-rate functions that locally grow arbitrarily fast. The\nanalysis under the former assumption does not generalize to problem\ntractability with variable power, whereas the latter assumption prohibits the\nresult from being applicable to well-behaved power-rate functions. As the first\ncontribution, we overcome the previous limitations by rigorously proving the\nproblem's NP-hardness for the representative logarithmic rate function. Next,\nwe extend the proof to reach a much stronger result, namely that the problem\nremains NP-hard, even if the channels allocated to each user is restricted to a\nconsecutive block with given size. We also prove that, under these\nrestrictions, there is a special case with polynomial-time tractability. Then,\nwe treat the problem class where the channels can be partitioned into an\narbitrarily large but constant number of groups, each having uniform gain for\nevery individual user. For this problem class, we present a polynomial-time\nalgorithm and prove optimality guarantee. In addition, we prove that the\nrecognition of this class is polynomial-time solvable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2011 16:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-13"}

Novel design criteria are thus required to capture the\ntrade-offs between the potentially infinite network lifetime and the uncertain\nenergy availability. This paper addresses the analysis and design of WSNs with\nEH devices by focusing on conventional MAC protocols, namely TDMA, Framed-ALOHA\n(FA) and Dynamic-FA (DFA), and by accounting for the performance trade-offs and\ndesign issues arising due to EH. A novel metric, referred to as delivery\nprobability, is introduced to measure the capability of a MAC protocol to\ndeliver the measure of any sensor in the network to the intended destination\n(or fusion center, FC). The interplay between delivery efficiency and time\nefficiency (i.e., the data collection rate at the FC), is investigated\nanalytically using Markov models. Numerical results validate the analysis and\nemphasize the critical importance of accounting for both delivery probability\nand time efficiency in the design of EH-WSNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2011 22:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Separate fusion filters are\ndesigned to consistently assimilate the local filtering distributions into the\nglobal posterior by compensating for the common past information between\nneighbouring nodes. The CF/DPF offers two distinct advantages over its\ncounterparts. First, the CF/DPF framework is suitable for scenarios where\nnetwork connectivity is intermittent and consensus can not be reached between\ntwo consecutive observations. Second, the CF/DPF is not limited to the Gaussian\napproximation for the global posterior density. A third contribution of the\npaper is the derivation of the exact expression for computing the posterior\nCramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) for the distributed architecture based on a\nrecursive procedure involving the local Fisher information matrices (FIM) of\nthe distributed estimators.

This work\nintroduces constructive and systematic methods for verifying the degree of\nmixing, from topological mixing to strong specification (or strong\nirreducibility) for two-dimensional shifts of finite type. First, transition\nmatrices on infinite strips of width $n$ are introduced for all $n\\geq 2$. To\ndetermine the primitivity of the transition matrices, connecting operators are\nintroduced to reduce the order of high-order transition matrices to yield\nlower-order transition matrices. Two sufficient conditions for primitivity are\nprovided; they are invariant diagonal cycles and primitive commutative cycles\nof connecting operators. After primitivity is established, the\ncorner-extendability and crisscross-extendability are used to demonstrate\ntopological mixing. In addition, the hole-filling condition yields the strong\nspecification.

This process results in the\nformation of very compact bulges with specific angular momentum a factor\n5-30$smaller than the average angular momentum of the baryons in the whole\nhalo. Such low angular momentum originates both from segregation and effective\ncancellation when the gas flows to the centre of the halo along well defined\ncold filamentary streams. These filaments penetrate deep inside the halo and\nconnect to the bulge from multiple rapidly changing directions. Structures\nfalling in along the filaments (satellite galaxies) or formed by gravitational\ninstabilities triggered by the inflow (star clusters) further reduce the\nangular momentum of the gas in the bulge. Finally, the fraction of gas radially\nfalling to the centre appears to increase with the mass of the halo; we argue\nthat this is most likely due to an enhanced cancellation of angular momentum in\nrarer halos which are fed by more isotropically distributed cold streams.

However, in practice the so-called jet\ntomography has turned out to be more difficult than expected initially. One of\nthe major obstacles in extracting reliable tomographic information from the\ndata is that neither the parton-medium interaction nor the medium geometry are\nknown with great precision, and thus a difference in model assumptions in the\nhard perturbative Quantum Choromdynamics (pQCD) modelling can usually be\ncompensated by a corresponding change of assumptions in the soft bulk medium\nsector and vice versa.

This work presents a meta-analysis summarizing results from a\nnumber of such systematical studies and discusses in detail how certain data\nsets provide specific constraints for models. Combining all available\ninformation, only a small group of models exhibiting certain characteristic\nfeatures consistent with a pQCD picture of parton-medium interaction is found\nto be viable given the data.

The evolution\nof the jets, and ultimately their radiative outcome, could depend strongly on\nthe inhomogeneity of the wind, which calls for a detailed study. The\nhydrodynamics of the interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied,\nfocusing on the global wind and single clump-jet interplay. We have performed,\nusing the code \\textit{Ratpenat}, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a\nclumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and of individual\nclumps penetrating into a jet. For typical wind and jet velocities, filling\nfactors of about > 0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as\nclumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the\nsystem. Kinetic luminosities of the order 1.e37 erg/s allow the jet to reach\nthe borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case,\nalthough with a substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to enter\ninto the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during a time of about their\nsize divided by the sound speed in the shocked clump. Then, clumps quickly\ndisrupt, mass-loading and slowing down the jet. We conclude that moderate wind\nclumpiness makes already a strong difference with the homogeneous wind case,\nenhancing jet disruption, mass-loading, bending, and likely energy dissipation\nin the form of emission. All this can have observational consequences at\nhigh-energies and also in the large scale radio jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 12:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To date, in spite of the enormous progresses in\nqualitative and quantitative neural modeling, this phase portrait has remained\nthe core picture of neuronal excitability.

In particular, it captures essential electrophysiological\nsignatures that otherwise require non-physiological alteration or considerable\ncomplexication of the classical model.

Synthetic photometry\nbased on the renormalized fluxes were compared to the standard UBVRI and BT, VT\nmagnitudes and revised synthetic zero-points were determined. The Hipparcos and\nTycho photometry system zero-points were also compared to the V magnitude\nzero-points of the SAAO UBVRI system, the homogenized UBV system and the\nWalraven V B system. The confusion in the literature concerning broadband\nmagnitudes, fluxes, passbands and the choice of appropriate mean wavelengths is\ndetailed and discussed in an appendix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 00:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This research study assesses the organizational and\nindividual determinants that influence the use of e-procurement system in\nUttarakhand public sector. This study provides managers with the valuable\ninformation to take intervention programs to achieve greater acceptance and\nusage of e-procurement system.
