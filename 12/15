Our observations\ntightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermost\nradius of approach of only ~3,100 times the event horizon that will be reached\nin 2013. Over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probably\nmainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitational\nforce.

The\nmodel involves two gauge fields, a standard one and a two-form gauge field. The\nphysical picture is that of a two-fluid model of chargeons and spinons\ninteracting by the topological BF term. When a Higgs mechanism of the second\nkind for the two-form gauge field takes place, chargeons and spinons are bound\ntogether into a charge 1 particle with spin 1/2.

The\ncanonical integral is calculated using a series expansion and the results are\nused to identify the validity zone of the conventional PE solution. The\nanalysis is performed within the framework of the non-dispersive AiB where the\naperture field is scaled with frequency such that the ray skeleton is\nfrequency-independent. This scaling enables an extension of the theory to the\nultra wide band (UWB) regime and ensures that the pulsed field propagates along\nthe curved beam trajectory without dispersion, as will be demonstrated in a\nsubsequent publication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 19:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It declines quite\nsteeply below about 0.07Msun with brown dwarfs (BDs) and very low mass stars\nhaving their own IMF. The most massive star of mass mmax formed in an embedded\ncluster with stellar mass Mecl correlates strongly with Mecl being a result of\ngravitation-driven but resource-limited growth and fragmentation induced\nstarvation. There is no convincing evidence whatsoever that massive stars do\nform in isolation.

We study whether generic scalar-tensor\n(ST) theories can be further constrained with EMRIs. We show that in the EMRI\nlimit, all such theories universally reduce to massive or massless Brans-Dicke\ntheory and that black holes do not emit dipolar radiation to all orders in\npost-Newtonian (PN) theory. For massless theories, we calculate the scalar\nenergy flux in the Teukolsky formalism to all orders in PN theory and fit it to\na high-order PN expansion. We derive the PN ST corrections to the Fourier\ntransform of the gravitational wave response and map it to the parameterized\npost-Einsteinian framework. We use the effective-one-body framework adapted to\nEMRIs to calculate the ST modifications to the gravitational waveform. We find\nthat such corrections are smaller than those induced in the early inspiral of\ncomparable-mass binaries, leading to projected bounds on the coupling that are\nworse than current Solar System ones. Brans-Dicke theory modifies the\nweak-field, with deviations in the energy flux that are largest at small\nvelocities. For massive theories, superradiance can lead to resonances in the\nscalar energy flux that can lead to floating orbits outside the innermost\nstable circular orbit and that last until the supermassive black hole loses\nenough mass and spin-angular momentum. If such floating orbits occur in the\nfrequency band of LISA, they would lead to a large dephasing (~1e6 rads),\npreventing detection with GR templates. A detection that is consistent with GR\nwould then rule out floating resonances at frequencies lower than the lowest\nobserved frequency, allowing for the strongest constraints yet on massive ST\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 21:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 10:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

Problems of sex\nratio, parasite virulence, microbial metabolism, punishment of noncooperators,\nand nearly all aspects of sociality have been analyzed as public goods shaped\nby kin and group selection. Here, I develop two general aspects of the public\ngoods problem that have received relatively little attention. First, variation\nin individual resources favors selfish individuals to vary their allocation to\npublic goods. Those individuals better endowed contribute their excess\nresources to public benefit, whereas those individuals with fewer resources\ncontribute less to the public good. Thus, purely selfish behavior causes\nindividuals to stratify into upper classes that contribute greatly to public\nbenefit and social cohesion and to lower classes that contribute little to the\npublic good. Second, if group success absolutely requires production of the\npublic good, then the pressure favoring production is relatively high. By\ncontrast, if group success depends weakly on the public good, then the pressure\nfavoring production is relatively weak. Stated in this way, it is obvious that\nthe role of baseline success is important. However, discussions of public goods\nproblems sometimes fail to emphasize this point sufficiently. The models here\nsuggest simple tests for the roles of resource variation and baseline success.\nGiven the widespread importance of public goods, better models and tests would\ngreatly deepen our understanding of many processes in biology and sociality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 21:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-16"}

The emerging quantum mechanical picture of a black hole is\nsurprisingly simple and fully parameterized by $N$.

First,\nan individual gains by outcompeting its neighbors for local resources. Second,\nan individual's share of group success must be weighted by the total\nproductivity of the group. The essence of sociality arises from the tension\nbetween selfish gains against neighbors and the associated loss that\nselfishness imposes by degrading the efficiency of the group. Without some\nforce to modulate selfishness, the natural tendencies of self interest\ntypically degrade group performance to the detriment of all. This is the\ntragedy of the commons. Kin selection provides the most widely discussed way in\nwhich the tragedy is overcome in biology. Kin selection arises from behavioral\nassociations within groups caused either by genetical kinship or by other\nprocesses that correlate the behaviors of group members. Here, I emphasize\ndemography as a second factor that may also modulate the tragedy of the commons\nand favor cooperative integration of groups. Each act of selfishness or\ncooperation in a group often influences group survival and fecundity over many\nsubsequent generations. For example, a cooperative act early in the growth\ncycle of a colony may enhance the future size and survival of the colony. This\ntime-dependent benefit can greatly increase the degree of cooperation favored\nby natural selection, providing another way in which to overcome the tragedy of\nthe commons and enhance the integration of group behavior. I conclude that\nanalyses of sociality must account for both the behavioral associations of kin\nselection theory and the demographic consequences of life history theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 21:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-16"}

We propose an alternative approach for\napproximating electrostatic charge distributions, Optimal Physical Multipoles\n(OPMs), which optimally represent the original charge distribution with a set\nof point charges. By construction, approximation of electrostatic potential\nbased on OPMs retains many of the useful properties of the corresponding point\nmultipole expansion, including the same asymptotic behavior of the approximate\npotential for a given multipole order. At the same time, OPMs can be\nsignificantly more accurate in the near field: up to 5 times more accurate for\nsome of the charge distributions tested here which are relevant to biomolecular\nmodeling. Unlike point multipoles, for point charge distributions the OPM\nalways converges to the original point charge distribution at finite order.\nFurthermore, OPMs may be more computationally efficient and easier to implement\ninto existing molecular simulations software packages than approximation\nschemes based on point multipoles. In addition to providing a general framework\nfor computing OPMs to any order, closed-form expressions for the lowest order\nOPMs (monopole and dipole) are derived.

These spectra reveal emission from\nPAHs, C60, and H2 superposed on a dust continuum. These emission components\nexhibit distinct spatial distributions: with increasing distance from the\nilluminating star, we observe the PAH emission followed by the dust continuum\nemission and the H2 emission. The C60 emission is located closest to the\nilluminating star in the south while in the north, it seems to be associated\nwith the H/H2 transition. Emission from PAHs and PAH-related species produce\nfeatures at 15.8, 16.4, 17.4, and 17.8 um and the 15-18 um plateau. These\ndifferent PAH features show distinct spatial distributions. The 15.8 um band\nand 15-18 um plateau correlate with the 11.2 um PAH band and with each other,\nand are attributed to large, neutral PAHs. Conversely, the 16.4 um feature\ncorrelates with the 12.7 um PAH band, suggesting that both arise from species\nthat are favored by the same conditions that favor PAH cations. The PAH\ncontribution to the 17.4 um band is displaced towards the illuminating star\nwith respect to the 11.2 and 12.7 um emission and is assigned to doubly ionized\nPAHs and/or a subset of cationic PAHs. The spatial distribution of the 17.8 um\nband suggests it arises from both neutral and cationic PAHs. In contrast to\ntheir intensities, the profiles of the PAH bands and the 15-18 um plateau do\nnot vary spatially. Consequently, we conclude that the carrier of the 15-18 um\nplateau is distinct from that of the PAH bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 23:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The Lorentz force due to the external shear\nfield component and the relaxation of tension in the twisted field are the\nmajor contributors to the rotation in this model, while reconnection with the\nambient field is of minor importance. Both major mechanisms writhe the flux\nrope axis, converting part of the initial twist helicity, and produce rotation\nprofiles which, to a large part, are very similar in a range of shear-twist\ncombinations. A difference lies in the tendency of twist-driven rotation to\nsaturate at lower heights than shear-driven rotation. For parameters\ncharacteristic of the source regions of erupting filaments and coronal mass\nejections, the shear field is found to be the dominant origin of rotations in\nthe corona and to be required if the rotation reaches angles of order 90\ndegrees and higher; it dominates even if the twist exceeds the threshold of the\nhelical kink instability. The contributions by shear and twist to the total\nrotation can be disentangled in the analysis of observations if the rotation\nand rise profiles are simultaneously compared with model calculations. The\nresulting twist estimate allows one to judge whether the helical kink\ninstability occurred. This is demonstrated for the erupting prominence in the\n\"Cartwheel CME\" on 9 April 2008, which has shown a rotation of \\approx 115\ndegrees up to a height of 1.5 R_sun above the photosphere. Out of a range of\ninitial equilibria which include strongly kink-unstable (twist Phi=5pi), weakly\nkink-unstable (Phi=3.5pi), and kink-stable (Phi=2.5pi) configurations, only the\nevolution of the weakly kink-unstable flux rope matches the observations in\ntheir entirety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 23:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Rubinowicz, on the other hand, was able\nto split the solution into two parts: one is the geometrical part that appears\nonly in the geometrical illuminated region, and the other representing the\nreflected wave is a line-integral along the edge of the aperture. However, this\ndecomposition is not entirely satisfactory in the sense that the two separated\nfields are discontinuous at the boundary of the illuminated region. Also, the\nfunctional form of the line-integral is not what one would expect an ordinary\nreflection wave should be due to some confusing factors in the integrand.\nFinally, the boundary conditions on the screen imposed by Kirchhoff's\napproximation are mathematically inconsistent, and therefore, rigorously, this\ndecomposition formulation must be slightly modified by taking into account the\ncorrect B.C.s. In this thesis, we use the consistent boundary conditions to\nderive a slightly different decomposition formula which shows that the behavior\nof the diffracted wave at the edge is exactly just like an ordinary\nreflection-realizing the conjecture of Thomas Young in the 18th century. We\nalso derived another decomposition formula which avoids mathematical\ndiscontinuity encountered by Rubinowicz. In the last section we demonstrate\nthat our solution is consistent with that obtained by Sommerfeld in the\nrigorous 2-D plane-wave diffraction problem, so our formulation in this sense\nmay describe more accurately the behavior of diffracted wave near the edge of\nthe aperture than Kirchhoff's formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 23:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-16"}

The particle's motion is hindered in the x-y\ndirections, allowing tunneling of particles through the walls, while no\nconfinement along the z direction is considered. It is shown that there exists\na finite Bose- Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature Tc that\ndecreases monotonically from the 3D ideal boson gas (IBG) value $T_{0}$ as the\nstrength of confinement $P_{0}$ is increased while keeping the channel's cross\nsection, $a_{x}a_{y}$ constant. In contrast, Tc is a non-monotonic function of\nthe cross-section area for fixed $P_{0}$. In addition to the BEC cusp, the\nspecific heat exhibits a set of maxima and minima. The minimum located at the\nhighest temperature is a clear signal of the confinement effect which occurs\nwhen the boson wavelength is twice the cross-section side size. This\nconfinement is amplified when the wall strength is increased until a\ndimensional crossover from 3D to 1D is produced.

The fundamental origin is the spin\ndependence of the Seebeck coefficient of a tunnel junction with at least one\nferromagnetic electrode. Seebeck spin tunneling creates a thermal flow of\nspin-angular momentum across a tunnel barrier without a charge tunnel current.\nIn ferromagnet/insulator/semiconductor tunnel junctions this can be used to\ninduce a spin accumulation (\\Delta \\mu) in the semiconductor in response to a\ntemperature difference (\\Delta T) between the electrodes. A phenomenological\nframework is presented to describe the thermal spin transport in terms of\nparameters that can be obtained from experiment or theory. Key ingredients are\na spin-polarized thermoelectric tunnel conductance and a tunnel spin\npolarization with non-zero energy derivative, resulting in different Seebeck\ntunnel coefficients for majority and minority spin electrons. We evaluate the\nthermal spin current, the induced spin accumulation and \\Delta\\mu/\\Delta T,\ndiscuss limiting regimes, and compare thermal and electrical flow of spin\nacross a tunnel barrier. A salient feature is that the thermally-induced spin\naccumulation is maximal for smaller tunnel resistance, in contrast to the\nelectrically-induced spin accumulation that suffers from the impedance mismatch\nbetween a ferromagnetic metal and a semiconductor. The thermally-induced spin\naccumulation produces an additional thermovoltage proportional to \\Delta\\mu,\nwhich can significantly enhance the conventional charge thermopower. Owing to\nthe Hanle effect, the thermopower can also be manipulated with a magnetic\nfield, producing a Hanle magnetothermopower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 06:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-20"}

In this\nwork, we model the long-term orbital evolution of an ensemble of fragments\nrepresenting hypothetical post-collision distributions at the time of the\nfamily's birth. We consider three distinct scenarios, in which the kinetic\nenergy of dispersed particles were varied such that their mean ejection\nvelocities (veje) were of order 200 m/s, 300 m/s and 400 m/s, respectively.\nEach simulation considered resulted in collisional families that reproduced\nthat currently observed. The results suggest that 60-75% of the fragments\ncreated in the collision will remain in the trans-Neptunian belt, even after 4\nGyr of dynamical evolution. The surviving particles were typically concentrated\nin wide regions of orbital element space centred on the initial impact\nlocation, with their orbits spread across a region spanning {\\Delta}a ~ 6-12\nAU, {\\Delta}e ~ 0.1-0.15 and {\\Delta}i ~ 7-10{\\deg}. Most of the survivors\npopulated the so-called Classical and Detached regions of the trans-Neptunian\nbelt, whilst a minor fraction entered the Scattered Disk reservoir (<1%), or\nwere captured in Neptunian mean motion resonances (<10%). In addition, except\nfor those fragments located near strong resonances, the great majority\ndisplayed negligible long-term orbital variation. This implies that the orbital\ndistribution of the intrinsic Haumean family can be used to constrain the\norbital conditions and physical nature of the collision that created the\nfamily, billions of years ago.

The resulting effective\nvacuum (called \"flavour vacuum\") was found to be characterized by a strong SUSY\nbreaking.

Similar features have\nbeen also observed in the two Type Ic SNe SN 2002ap and SN 1994I that are not\nassociated to GRBs. We advance the possibility that the late X-ray emission\nobserved in GRB-SN and in isolated SN is associated to a hot neutron star (NS)\njust formed in the SN event, here defined as a neo-NS. We discuss the thermal\nevolution of neo-NS in the age regime that spans from $\\sim 1$ minute (just\nafter the proto-NS phase) up to ages <10-100 yr. We examine the key factor\ngoverning the neo-NS cooling emphasizing on the neutrino emission. A\nphenomenological heating source and new boundary conditions are introduced to\nmimic the high-temperature atmosphere of young NSs. We match the neo-NS\nluminosity to the late X-ray emission of the GRB-SN events URCA-1 in\nGRB980425-SN1998bw, URCA-2 in GRB030329-SN2003dh, and URCA-3 in\nGRB031203-SN2003lw.

It is therefore\nappropriate to revise the boundary conditions used in the cooling theory of\nNSs, to match the proper conditions of the atmosphere at young ages. Additional\nheating processes that are still not studied within this context, such as e+e-\npair creation by overcritical fields and nuclear fusion and fission energy\nrelease, might also take place under such conditions and deserve further\nanalysis.

We address this issue\nby comparing different classical and more recently developed network models\nwith respect to their generalisation power, which we identify with large\nstructural variability and absence of constraints imposed by the construction\nscheme. After having identified the most variable networks, we address the\nissue of which constraints are common to all network classes and are thus\nsuitable candidates for being generic statistical laws of complex networks. In\nfact, we find that generic, not model-related dependencies between different\nnetwork characteristics do exist.

Their influence is analyzed from\nthree points of view: 1. flexibility of the model with respect to a parameter\nthat is related to the lowest value of the cost function that can be obtained\nin the data assimilation experiment that controls this parameter; 2.\npossibility to improve the model by the parameter's control, i.e. whether the\nsolution with the optimal parameter remains close to observations after the end\nof control; 3. sensitivity of the model solution to the parameter in a\nclassical sense.

An essential step in the hunt for this emergent\nparticle is the unequivocal observation of supercurrent in a topological phase.\nHere, we present the first measurement of a Josephson supercurrent through a\ntopological insulator. Direct evidence for Josephson supercurrents in\nsuperconductor (Nb) - topological insulator (Bi2Te3) - superconductor e-beam\nfabricated junctions is provided by the observation of clear Shapiro steps\nunder microwave irradiation, and a Fraunhofer-type dependence of the critical\ncurrent on magnetic field. The dependence of the critical current on\ntemperature and length shows that the junctions are in the ballistic limit.\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations in magnetic fields up to 30 T reveal a\ntopologically non-trivial two-dimensional surface state. We argue that the\nballistic Josephson current is hosted by this surface state despite the fact\nthat the normal state transport is dominated by diffusive bulk conductivity.\nThe lateral Nb-Bi2Te3-Nb junctions hence provide prospects for the realization\nof devices supporting Majorana fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 14:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-23"}

For the\nmore general case (what we call discrete-time models), it is not trivial to\ngenerate a substitution matrix $P$ of given determinant (i.e. corresponding to\na process of given branch length). In this paper we solve this problem for the\nmost well-known discrete-time models JC*, K80*, K81*, SSM and GMM. These models\nlie in the class of nonhomogeneous evolutionary models.

Future attosecond science\nexperiments need not be restricted to spatially averaged observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 15:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-15"}

This chapter\nshows, by examples, how modeling all these features using Bayesian methods. In\nshort, one just need to formalize, using maths, the logical link between the\ninvolved quantities, how the data arise and what we already known on the\nquantities we want to study. The posterior probability distribution summarizes\nwhat we known on the studied quantities after the data, and we should not be\nafraid about their actual numerical computation, because it is left to\n(special) Monte Carlo programs such as JAGS. As examples, we show how to\npredict the mass of a new object disposing of a calibrating sample, how to\nconstraint cosmological parameters from supernovae data and how to check if the\nfitted data are in tension with the adopted fitting model. Examples are given\nwith their coding. These examples can be easily used as template for completely\ndifferent analysis, on totally unrelated astronomical objects, requiring to\nmodel the same awkward data features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 10:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

It was known that unlike scalar case the\nentanglement of fermionic maximally entangled states survives even in the\ninfinite acceleration limit. Also for the fermionic system it was discussed\nthat one may consider the approach beyond single mode approximation. However\ndue to the peculiar property of fermionic system there has been different\nopinions about correct physical structure of fermionic system. Recently Montero\nand Mart\\'{i}n-Mart\\'{i}nez suggested an approach beyond single mode\napproximation.
