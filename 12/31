The study of linear spectra provides us with the basis to\nunderstand the dynamical features arising from the vibronic structure in\nnon-linear spectra in a progressive fashion, starting from a microscopic model\nto finally performing an inhomogenous average. We show that the discreteness of\nthe vibronic structure can be witnessed by probing the diagonal peaks of the\nnon-linear spectra by means of a relative phase shift in the waiting time\nresolved signal. Moreover, we demonstrate the photon-echo and non-rephasing\npaths are sensitive to different harmonics in the vibrational manifold when\nstatic disorder is taken into account. Supported by analytical and numerical\ncalculations, we show that nondiagonal resonances in the 2D spectra in the\nwaiting time, further capture the discreteness of vibrations through a\nmodulation of the amplitude without any effect in the signal intrinsic\nfrequency.

The goal of this work is to design\nefficient strategies to learn about the field by collecting sensed data from\nthese $n$ sensors with less computational overhead and efficient storage\nencoding operations.\n  In this data collection system, we propose two distributed data storage\nalgorithms (DSA's) to solve this problem with the means of network flooding and\nconnectivity among sensor devices. In the first algorithm denoted, DSA-I, it's\nassumed that the total number of nodes is known for each node in the network.\nWe show that this algorithm is efficient in terms of the encoding/decoding\noperations. Furthermore, every node uses network flooding to disseminate its\ndata throughout the network using mixing time approximately O(n). In the second\nalgorithm denoted, DSA-II, it's assumed that the total number of nodes is not\nknown for each learning sensor, hence dissemination of the data does not depend\non the value of $n$. In this case we show that the encoding operations take\n$O(C\\mu^2)$, where $\\mu$ is the mean degree of the network graph and $C$ is a\nsystem parameter.

The analysis of X-ray lags (up to the\nhighest/shortest frequencies/time-scales), is performed in the\nFourier-frequency domain, between energy bands where the soft excess (soft\nband) and the primary power law (hard band) dominate the emission. We report a\ntotal of 15 out of 32 sources displaying a high frequency soft lag in their\nlight curves.

In this paper, we examine two\ncases of random walks performed on a class of modular scale-free networks with\nmultiple traps located at several given nodes. We first derive a formula of the\nmean first-passage time (MFPT) for a general network, which is the mean of the\nexpected time to absorption originating from a specific node, averaged over all\nnon-trap starting nodes. Although the computation is complex, the expression of\nthe formula is exact; moreover, the computational approach and procedure are\nindependent of the number and position of the traps. We then determine\nanalytically the MFPT for the two random walks being considered. The obtained\nanalytical results are in complete agreement with the numerical ones. Our\nresults show that the number and location of traps play an important role in\nthe behavior of the MFPT, since for both cases the MFPT grows as a power-law\nfunction of the number of nodes, but their exponents are quite different. We\ndemonstrate that the root of the difference in the behavior of MFPT is\nattributed to the modular and scale-free topologies of the networks.

Our setting is a\npartially linear model with possibly non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic\ndisturbances. Our analysis allows the number of controls to be much larger than\nthe sample size. To make informative inference feasible, we require the model\nto be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding\nfactors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by conditioning\non a relatively small number of controls whose identities are unknown. The\nlatter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by\nselecting approximately the right set of controls. We develop a novel\nestimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in\nthis setting, called the \"post-double-selection\" method. Our results apply to\nLasso-type methods used for covariate selection as well as to any other model\nselection method that is able to find a sparse model with good approximation\nproperties.\n  The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect\nselection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid\nuniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model\nselection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases\nwith a small, fixed number of controls. Thus our method resolves the problem of\nuniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of\nmodels. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical\nsimulations and an application to the effect of abortion on crime rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2011 04:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 01:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 15:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

A measurement of the\nmodification of the non-photonic electron spectrum in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions relative to p + p collisions allows the interactions of heavy quarks\nwith the medium to be studied. Previous measurements indicate that\nhigh-transverse-momentum non-photonic electrons are suppressed in Au + Au\ncollisions at 200 GeV (center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair) relative to p +\np collisions at the same energy. The magnitude of that suppression is larger\nthan was anticipated and it has been a challenge for theoretical models to\npredict the in-medium energy loss of light and heavy quarks simultaneously.\n  This dissertation presents the first measurement of the yield of non-photonic\nelectrons from open heavy-flavor decays in Cu + Cu collisions at 200 GeV and\nthe suppression of that yield relative to p + p collisions. A comparison of\nthis result to similar results for Au + Au collisions provides some indication\nthat the geometry of a heavy-ion collision affects the average amount of energy\nloss by heavy quarks passing through the quark-gluon plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2011 08:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

We provide a theoretical explanation of the\nobserved dependence of the high-frequency cutoff from the pulsar period. The\ndependence of the cutoff position from the magnetic field is predicted. This\nexplanation is based on a new mechanism for electron radio emission in pulsars.\nNamely, radiation occurs in the inner (polar) gap, when electrons are\naccelerated in the electric field that is increasing from zero level at the\nstar surface. In this case acceleration of electrons passes through a maximum\nand goes to zero when the electron velocity approaches the speed of light. All\nthe radiated power is located within the radio frequency band. The averaging of\nintensity radiation over the polar cap, with some natural assumptions of the\ncoherence of the radiation, leads to the observed spectra. It also leads to an\nacceptable estimate of the power of radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2011 13:45:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 15:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 21:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2013 16:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The challenge is that often the underlying cost function is neither\nglobally differentiable nor convex, and despite this one would like to have\nguaranteed convergence to the global minimizer. After some necessary\npreparations we state a conjecture which we argue is the best (in a sense\ndescribed) convergence condition one can hope for.
