We show that this\nincludes \"new\" UVQD (widely unfamiliar to modern audiences). We also show that\ntadpole renormalization is an automatic consequence of Ward-Takahashi\nidentities.\n  We prove that all UVQD therefore vanish identically in the Goldstone-mode\nlimit, where pions are Nambu-Goldstone Bosons (NGB), and where Lee and\nSymanzik's Goldstone Symmetry Restoration Condition (a renormalization\nprescription) enforces spontaneous symmetry breaking and the massless-ness of\nNGB. Axial-vector current conservation is restored as is SU(2)(L-R) chiral\nsymmetry: the vanishing of UVQD is therefore achieved in the Goldstone-mode by\nrestoration of an exact symmetry, and therefore (by definition) without\nfine-tuning!\n  A weak-scale Higgs mass is therefore not UVQD fine-tuned in the spontaneously\nbroken GML LSM. That is simply another (albeit unfamiliar) consequence of the\nGoldstone Theorem. Hence Goldstone-mode O(4) LSM symmetries are sufficient to\nensure that the theory does not suffer from the Higgs Fine Tuning Problem. This\nis contrary to the widely accepted belief that UVQD in the Higgs mass lead to\nsuch problems in the O(4) LSM, which are then presumed to be inherited by the\nStandard Model (SM). The key observation is to regard the spontaneously broken\nO(4) LSM as the Goldstone-mode limit of the GML LSM.\n  We prove this first at 1-loop then at all loop orders for the pure scalar GML\nmodel.

This is intriguing,\nsince in most other rearrangement models (DCJ, reversal, unichromosomal or\nmultilinear breakpoint models), the problem is NP-hard. The complexity of the\nsmall or even the large phylogeny problem under the breakpoint distance\nremained an open problem. We improve the algorithm for the median problem and\nshow that it is equivalent to the problem of finding maximum cardinality\nnon-bipartite matching (under linear reduction). On the other hand, we prove\nthat the more general small phylogeny problem is NP-hard. Surprisingly, we show\nthat it is already NP-hard (or even APX-hard) for 4 species (a quartet\nphylogeny). In other words, while finding an ancestor for 3 species is easy,\nfinding two ancestors for 4 species is already hard. We also show that, in the\nunichromosomal and the multilinear breakpoint model, the halving problem is\nNP-hard, thus refuting the conjecture of Tannier et al.

We\ncombine the population synthesis code Starburst99 with a semi-analytical model\nof galactic outflows and a model for the distribution and abundances of\nchemical elements inside the outflows. Starting with a galaxy mass, formation\nredshift, and adopting a particular form for the star formation rate, we\ndescribe the evolution of the stellar populations in the galaxy, the evolution\nof the metallicity and chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM),\nthe propagation of the galactic wind, and the metal-enrichment of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we study the properties of the\nmodel, by varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate, and the\nefficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1) For a\ngiven star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star\nformation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*\nis sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the\nISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and\nstellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material\nejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies\nare the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor\nrole in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy\ninput is small compared to supernovae. However, they contribute significantly\nto the chemical composition of the galactic wind. We conclude that the history\nof the ISM enrichment plays a determinant role in the chemical composition and\nextent of the galactic wind, and therefore its ability to enrich the IGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 18:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The distribution of rotation periods we measure is broadly\nuniform for 0.5 < P < 10 d; the short-period cutoff corresponds to breakup. We\nobserve no obvious bimodality in the period distribution, but we do find that\nstars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average. The stars' X-ray\nluminosities are roughly flat with rotation period, at the saturation level\n($\\log L_X / L_{\\rm bol} \\approx -3.3$). However, we find a significant\npositive correlation between $L_X / L_{\\rm bol}$ and co-rotation radius,\nsuggesting that the observed X-ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugal\nstripping of the stellar coronae. The period-mass relationship in NGC 6530 is\nbroadly similar to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), but the slope of the\nrelationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the ONC and other\nyoung clusters. We show that the slope of the period-mass relationship for the\nslowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster, and we\nargue that NGC 6530 may be slightly younger than the ONC, making it a\nparticularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution in\nyoung, low-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2011 16:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Obtained thereby, the\ne.m. interactions of baryons are typically described by hard form factors. In\ncontrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent\ninteraction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering\nand resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of\nQCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the\nratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of\nthe dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are\nimportant. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac\nform factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we\nshow via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's\ndiquark content. The contact interaction produces a first excitation of the\nnucleon that is constituted predominantly from axial-vector diquark\ncorrelations. This impacts greatly on the gamma*p->P_{11}(1440) form factors.\nNotably, our quark core contribution to F_2*(Q^2) exhibits a zero at\nQ^2~0.5mN^2. Faddeev equation treatments of a hadron's quark core usually\nunderestimate its magnetic properties, hence we consider the effect produced by\na dressed-quark anomalous e.m. moment.

We explore these\nassumptions using one hundred systems with halo masses similar to that of the\nMilky Way, identified in a series of cosmological gasdynamical simulations\nGIMIC. At z=0, the simulated galaxies exhibit a wide variety of morphologies,\nfrom dispersion-dominated spheroids to pure disk galaxies. Surprisingly, these\nmorphological features are very poorly correlated with their halo properties:\ndisks form in halos with high and low net spin, and mergers play a negligible\nrole in the formation of spheroid stars, most of which form in-situ. More\nimportant to morphology is the coherent alignment of the angular momentum of\nbaryons that accrete over time to form a galaxy. Spheroids tend to form when\nthe spin of newly-accreted gas is misaligned with that of the extant galaxy,\nleading to the episodic formation of stars with different kinematics that\ncancel out the net rotation of the system. Disks, on the other hand, form out\nof gas that flows in with similar angular momentum to that of earlier-accreted\nmaterial. Gas accretion from a hot corona thus favours disk formation, whereas\ngas that flows \"cold\", often along separate, misaligned filaments, favours the\nformation of spheroids. In this scenario, most spheroids consist of\nsuperpositions of stellar components with distinct kinematics, age, and\nmetallicity, an arrangement that might survive to the present day given the\npaucity of major mergers. Since angular momentum is acquired largely at\nturnaround, morphology is imprinted early by the interplay of the tidal field\nand the shape of the material destined to form the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 21:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 08:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-13"}

The distribution of relative\nX-ray brightness for our low-redshift weak-line quasar (WLQ) candidates is\nsignificantly different from that of typical radio-quiet quasars, having an\nexcess of X-ray weak sources, but it is consistent with that of high-redshift\nWLQs. The X-ray weak sources generally show similar UV emission-line properties\nto those of the X-ray weak quasar PHL 1811; they may belong to the notable\nclass of PHL 1811 analogs. The average X-ray spectrum of these sources is\nsomewhat harder than that of typical radio-quiet quasars. Several other\nlow-redshift WLQ candidates have normal ratios of X-ray-to-optical/UV flux, and\ntheir average X-ray spectral properties are also similar to those of typical\nradio-quiet quasars. The X-ray weak and X-ray normal WLQ candidates may belong\nto the same subset of quasars having high-ionization \"shielding gas\" covering\nmost of the wind-dominated broad emission-line region, but be viewed at\ndifferent inclinations. The mid-infrared-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of these sources are generally consistent with those of typical SDSS\nquasars, showing that they are not likely to be BL Lac objects with\nrelativistically boosted continua and diluted emission lines. However, one\nsource in our X-ray observed sample is remarkably strong in X-rays, indicating\nthat a small fraction of low-redshift WLQ candidates may actually be BL Lacs\nresiding in the radio-faint tail of the BL Lac population. We also investigate\nuniversal selection criteria for WLQs over a wide range of redshift, finding\nthat it is not possible to select WLQ candidates in a fully consistent way\nusing different prominent emission lines as a function of redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 22:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

These forces stem from an interplay between the\nquenched statistics of random charges and the induced dielectric image charges.\nThis type of interaction has recently been evoked to interpret measurements of\nCasimir forces in vacuo, where a precise analysis of such disorder-induced\neffects appears to be necessary. Here we consider the torque acting on a\nrandomly charged dielectric surface (or a sphere) mounted on a central axle\nnext to another randomly charged surface and show that although the resultant\nmean torque is zero, its sample-to-sample fluctuation exhibits a long-range\nbehavior with the separation distance between the juxtaposed surfaces and that,\nin particular, its root-mean-square value scales with the total area of the\nsurfaces. Therefore, the disorder-induced torque between two randomly charged\nsurfaces is expected to be much more pronounced than the disorder-induced\nlateral force and may provide an effective way to determine possible disorder\neffects in experiments, in a manner that is independent of the usual normal\nforce measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2011 09:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 07:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-20"}

The angler goes\nfishing. He uses various techniques and he has at most two fishing rods. He\nbuys a fishing ticket for a fixed time. The fishes are caught with the use of\ndifferent methods according to the renewal processes. The fishes' value and the\ninter arrival times are given by the sequences of independent, identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) random variables with the known distribution functions. It\nforms the marked renewal--reward process. The angler's measure of satisfaction\nis given by the difference between the utility function, depending on the value\nof the fishes caught, and the cost function connected with the time of fishing.\nIn this way, the angler's relative opinion about the methods of fishing is\nmodelled. The angler's aim is to have as much satisfaction as possible and\nadditionally he has to leave the lake before a fixed moment. Therefore his goal\nis to find two optimal stopping times in order to maximize his satisfaction. At\nthe first moment, he changes the technique of fishing, e.g. by excluding one\nrod and intensifying on the rest. Next, he decides when he should stop the\nexpedition. These stopping times have to be shorter than the fixed time of\nfishing. The dynamic programming methods have been used to find these two\noptimal stopping times and to specify the expected satisfaction of the angler\nat these times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2011 12:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-13"}

While exhaustive search remains asymptotically\nthe fastest known algorithm for some basic problems, difficult and non-trivial\nexponential time algorithms have been found for a myriad of problems, including\nGraph Coloring, Hamiltonian Path, Dominating Set and 3-CNF-Sat. In some\ninstances, improving these algorithms further seems to be out of reach. The\nCNF-Sat problem is the canonical example of a problem for which the trivial\nexhaustive search algorithm runs in time O(2^n), where n is the number of\nvariables in the input formula. While there exist non-trivial algorithms for\nCNF-Sat that run in time o(2^n), no algorithm was able to improve the growth\nrate 2 to a smaller constant, and hence it is natural to conjecture that 2 is\nthe optimal growth rate. The strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) by\nImpagliazzo and Paturi [JCSS 2001] goes a little bit further and asserts that,\nfor every epsilon<1, there is a (large) integer k such that that k-CNF-Sat\ncannot be computed in time 2^{epsilon n}.\n  In this paper, we show that, for every epsilon < 1, the problems Hitting Set,\nSet Splitting, and NAE-Sat cannot be computed in time O(2^{epsilon n}) unless\nSETH fails.
