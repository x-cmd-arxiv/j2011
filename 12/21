Since the\nmagnetic field information is encoded in the polarization of the spectral line\nradiation, it is important to investigate whether the He II line radiation from\nthe solar disk can be polarized, along with its magnetic sensitivity. Here we\nreport some theoretical predictions concerning the linear polarization signals\nproduced by scattering processes in this strong emission line of the solar\ntransition region, taking into account radiative transfer and the Hanle effect\ncaused by the presence of organized and random magnetic fields. We find that\nthe fractional polarization amplitudes are significant (${\\sim}1%$), even when\nconsidering the wavelength-integrated signals. Interestingly, the scattering\npolarization of the Ly-alpha line of He II starts to be sensitive to the Hanle\neffect for magnetic strengths B>100 G (i.e., for magnetic strengths of the\norder of and larger than the Hanle saturation field of the hydrogen Ly-alpha\nline at 1216 \\AA). We therefore propose simultaneous observations of the\nscattering polarization in both Ly-alpha lines to facilitate magnetic field\nmeasurements in the upper solar chromosphere. Even the development of a\nnarrow-band imaging polarimeter for the He II 304 \\AA\\ line alone would be\nalready of great diagnostic value for probing the solar transition region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 16:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Imposing gauge\ninvariance as the last step upon R_xi gauge calculations with four-dimensional\ngauge-breaking regulators, allows indeed to recover the well known H -> gamma\ngamma result. However we show that in the particular case of the unitary gauge,\nthe indeterminacy cannot be tackled in this same way. The combination of\nunitary gauge with a cutoff regularization scheme turns out to be\nnon-predictive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 16:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-22"}

Furthermore, the asymmetry is observed to have the\nopposite sign in power spectra made from line-of-sight velocity and continuum\nintensity. The asymmetry and its reversal in sign has previously been explained\nusing a combination of mechanisms that involve the acoustic source. A localized\nacoustic source within an acoustic cavity naturally generates asymmetric\nprofiles through wave interference; however, the sign of the asymmetry due to\nthis mechanism is identical for all observables. The reversal of the asymmetry\nbetween velocity and intensity observations has been attributed to the\nvisibility of the source itself (i.e., \"correlated noise\"). In this paper, I\nwill show that asymmetry generated by a localized source can be interpreted as\neither a wave interference effect in physical space, or a mode interference\neffect in spectral space. I advocate a new mode-fitting procedure based on this\nnew interpretation, whereby the complex phases of all the modes determine the\nmode asymmetries. Further, I suggest that information about the acoustic source\nfunction is encapsulated in the amplitude of each mode, and present a scheme by\nwhich the source function can be obtained from measured mode amplitudes by\nstandard helioseismic inversion techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 18:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-21"}

Recently, a new DAV star, WD J191643.83+393849.7, has been discovered\nin the field of the Kepler spacecraft. It is expected that further monitoring\nof this star in the next years will enable astronomers to obtain the best\nlightcurve of a pulsating DA white dwarf ever recorded, and thus to know with\nunprecedented precision the hidden details of the internal structure of this\nstar. In this paper, we perform a first asteroseismological analysis of WD\nJ191643.83+393849.7 on the basis of fully evolutionary DA white-dwarf models.\nSpecifically, we employ a complete set of evolutionary DA white-dwarf\nstructures covering a wide range of effective temperatures, stellar masses, and\nH envelope thicknesses. These models have been obtained on the basis of a\ncomplete treatment of the evolutionary history of progenitors stars. We compute\ng-mode adiabatic pulsation periods for this set of models and compare them with\nthe pulsation periods exhibited by WD J191643.83+393849.7. Based on a tentative\nestimation of the mean period spacing of the star, we find that the stellar\nmass should be substantially large ($\\gtrsim 0.80 M_{\\odot}$), in agreement\nwith the spectroscopically derived stellar mass. Also, from period-to-period\nfits we find an asteroseismological model characterised by a low effective\ntemperature, rather high stellar mass and a thin H envelope. The possibility\nthat this rather massive pulsating white dwarf can be further monitored with\nKepler with a high degree of detail turns the star WD J191643.83+393849.7 into\na promising and unique object to study the physics of crystallization and\ncarbon/oxygen phase diagrams at high densities.

Recent information-theoretic\nresults, obtained under ideal channel conditions (perfect synchronization, no\ndispersion), indicate that low-precision ADC (1-4 bits) could be a suitable\nchoice for designing such high speed systems. In this work, we study the impact\nof employing low-precision ADC in a {\\it carrier asynchronous} system.\nSpecifically, we consider transmission over the block noncoherent Additive\nWhite Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, and investigate the achievable performance\nunder low-precision output quantization. We focus attention on an architecture\nin which the receiver quantizes {\\it only the phase} of the received signal:\nthis has the advantage of being implementable without automatic gain control,\nusing multiple 1-bit ADCs preceded by analog multipliers. For standard uniform\nPhase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation, we study the structure of the transition\ndensity of the resulting phase-quantized block noncoherent channel. Several\nresults, based on the symmetry inherent in the channel model, are provided to\ncharacterize this transition density. Low-complexity procedures for computing\nthe channel capacity, and for block demodulation, are obtained using these\nresults. Numerical computations are performed to compare the performance of\nquantized and unquantized systems, for different quantization precisions, and\ndifferent block lengths. It is observed, for example, that with QPSK\nmodulation, 8-bin phase quantization of the received signal recovers about\n80-85% of the capacity attained with unquantized observations, while 12-bin\nphase quantization recovers more than 90% of the unquantized capacity.\nDithering the constellation is shown to improve the performance in the face of\ndrastic quantization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 19:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-21"}

These show universal statistical properties on long\nlength scales, and geometrical phase transitions analogous to percolation\ntransitions but in distinct universality classes. The field theories for these\nproblems have not previously been identified, so that while many numerical\nstudies have been performed, a framework for interpreting the results has been\nlacking. We provide such a framework with mappings to simple supersymmetric\nmodels. Our main focus is on vortices in short-range correlated complex fields,\nwhich show a geometrical phase transition that we argue is described by the\nCP^{k|k} model (essentially the CP^{n-1} model in the replica limit\nn\\rightarrow 1). This can be seen by mapping a lattice version of the problem\nto a lattice gauge theory. A related field theory with a noncompact gauge\nfield, the 'NCCP^{k|k} model', is a supersymmetric extension of the standard\ndual theory for the XY transition, and we show that XY duality gives another\nway to understand the appearance of field theories of this type. The\nsupersymmetric descriptions yield results relevant, for example, to vortices in\nthe XY model and in superfluids, to optical vortices, and to certain models of\ncosmic strings. A distinct but related field theory, the RP^{2l|2l} model (or\nthe RP^{n-1} model in the limit n\\rightarrow 1) describes the unoriented\nvortices which occur for instance in nematic liquid crystals. Finally, we show\nthat in two dimensions, a lattice gauge theory analogous to that discussed in\nthree dimensions gives a simple way to see the known relation between\ntwo-dimensional percolation and the CP^{k|k} sigma model with a \\theta-term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 20:20:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 15:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-03"}

In this series of papers, we analyze the results of an extensive\nsuite of 3D numerical simulations of the process, and ultimately propose a new\n1D prescription for heat and compositional transport in this regime which can\nbe used in stellar or planetary structure and evolution models.\n  In a preliminary study of the phenomenon, Rosenblum et al. (2011) showed\nthat, after saturation of the primary instability, a system can evolve in one\nof two possible ways: the induced turbulence either remains homogeneous, with\nvery weak transport properties, or transitions into a thermo-compositional\nstaircase where the transport rate is much larger (albeit still smaller than in\nstandard convection).\n  In this paper, we show that this dichotomous behavior is a robust property of\nsemi-convection across a wide region of parameter space. We propose a simple\nsemi-analytical criterion to determine whether layer formation is expected or\nnot, and at what rate it proceeds, as a function of the background\nstratification and of the diffusion parameters (viscosity, thermal diffusivity\nand compositional diffusivity) only. The theoretical criterion matches the\noutcome of our numerical simulations very adequately in the numerically\naccessible \"planetary\" parameter regime, and can easily be extrapolated to the\nstellar parameter regime.\n  Subsequent papers will address more specifically the question of quantifying\ntransport in the layered case and in the non-layered case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 20:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The critical amplitude of the singular part of the\nfree energy is given by the universal number\n$\\frac13[\\frac1{2\\pi}\\zeta(3)-\\mathrm{Cl}_2(\\frac{\\pi}3)]=-0.274543...$, where\n$\\zeta(z)$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}_2(z)$ are the Riemann zeta and Clausen's functions,\nrespectively.

An important question that permeates this debate is the transport of\nmagnetic flux. This is particularly important, for instance, in the context of\nstar formation. When clouds collapse gravitationally to form stars, there must\nbe some magnetic flux transport. otherwise the new born stars would have\nmagnetic fields several orders of magnitude larger than the observed ones.\nAlso, the magnetic flux that is dragged in the late stages of the formation of\na star can remove all the rotational support from the accretion disk that grows\naround the protostar. The efficiency of the mechanism which is often invoked to\nallow the transport of magnetic fields in the different stages of star\nformation, namely, the ambipolar diffusion, has been lately put in check. We\nhere discuss an alternative mechanism for magnetic flux transport which is\nbased on turbulent fast magnetic reconnection. We review recent results\nobtained from 3D MHD numerical simulations that indicate that this mechanism is\nvery efficient for decoupling and transport magnetic flux from the inner denser\nregions to the outskirts of collapsing clouds in the different stages of star\nformation. We also discuss this mechanism in the context of dynamo processes\nand speculate that it can play a role both in the solar dynamo and in accretion\ndisk dynamo processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 22:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In several such scenarios, interference alignment\nwas used to characterize the degrees-of-freedom of the channel. However, these\ndegrees-of-freedom capacity approximations are often too weak to make accurate\npredictions about the behavior of channel capacity at finite signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs). The aim of this paper is to significantly strengthen these\nresults by showing that interference alignment can be used to characterize\ncapacity to within a constant gap. We focus on real, time-invariant,\nfrequency-flat X-channels. The only known solutions achieving the\ndegrees-of-freedom of this channel are either based on real interference\nalignment or on layer-selection schemes. Neither of these solutions seems\nsufficient for a constant-gap capacity approximation.\n  In this paper, we propose a new communication scheme and show that it\nachieves the capacity of the Gaussian X-channel to within a constant gap. To\naid in this process, we develop a novel deterministic channel model. This\ndeterministic model depends on the 0.5log(SNR) most-significant bits of the\nchannel coefficients rather than only the single most-significant bit used in\nconventional deterministic models. The proposed deterministic model admits a\nwider range of achievable schemes that can be translated to the Gaussian\nchannel. For this deterministic model, we find an approximately optimal\ncommunication scheme. We then translate this scheme for the deterministic\nchannel to the original Gaussian X-channel and show that it achieves capacity\nto within a constant gap. This is the first constant-gap result for a general,\nfully-connected network requiring interference alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 23:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 20:22:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 20:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

One unfortunate phenomenon, however, poisons the competition\nand the fun: cheating. The costs of cheating span from industry-supported\nexpenditures to detect and limit cheating, to victims' monetary losses due to\ncyber crime.\n  This paper studies cheaters in the Steam Community, an online social network\nbuilt on top of the world's dominant digital game delivery platform. We\ncollected information about more than 12 million gamers connected in a global\nsocial network, of which more than 700 thousand have their profiles flagged as\ncheaters. We also collected in-game interaction data of over 10 thousand\nplayers from a popular multiplayer gaming server. We show that cheaters are\nwell embedded in the social and interaction networks: their network position is\nlargely undistinguishable from that of fair players. We observe that the\ncheating behavior appears to spread through a social mechanism: the presence\nand the number of cheater friends of a fair player is correlated with the\nlikelihood of her becoming a cheater in the future. Also, we observe that there\nis a social penalty involved with being labeled as a cheater: cheaters are\nlikely to switch to more restrictive privacy settings once they are tagged and\nthey lose more friends than fair players. Finally, we observe that the number\nof cheaters is not correlated with the geographical, real-world population\ndensity, or with the local popularity of the Steam Community.\n  This analysis can ultimately inform the design of mechanisms to deal with\nanti-social behavior (e.g., spamming, automated collection of data) in generic\nonline social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 03:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

Therefore, they have higher\nrestoration speed, lower signaling complexity, and higher transmission\nintegrity. This paper introduces a coding-based protection scheme, named Coded\nPath Protection (CPP). In CPP, a backup copy of the primary data is encoded\nwith other data streams, resulting in capacity savings.

We find that 7\nsources in our sample are Type 1 AGN while 20 are Type 2 AGN, with their\nredshifts lying between 0.009 and 0.075; the remaining object is a Galactic\ncataclysmic variable (CV). In this work we provide optical information for all\n28 sources and the results of the soft X-ray analysis of 3 out of 5 AGN\nobserved with XMM/Newton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 11:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

We formulate a flow- and context-sensitive points-to analysis\nthat is lazy in the following sense: points-to information is computed only for\nlive pointers and its propagation is sparse (restricted to live ranges of\nrespective pointers). Further, our analysis (a) uses strong liveness,\neffectively including dead code elimination; (b) afterwards calculates\nmust-points-to information from may-points-to information instead of using a\nmutual fixed-point; and (c) uses value-based termination of call strings during\ninterprocedural analysis (which reduces the number of call strings\nsignificantly).\n  A naive implementation of our analysis within GCC-4.6.0 gave analysis time\nand size of points-to measurements for SPEC2006. Using liveness reduced the\namount of points-to information by an order of magnitude with no loss of\nprecision. For all programs under 30kLoC we found that the results were much\nmore precise than gcc's analysis. What comes as a pleasant surprise however, is\nthe fact that below this cross-over point, our naive linked-list implementation\nis faster than a flow- and context-insensitive analysis which is primarily used\nfor efficiency. We speculate that lazy flow- and context-sensitive analyses may\nbe not only more precise, but also more efficient, than current approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 12:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

A\nlarge effort is therefore undertaken to compile global galaxy cluster\nproperties in particular obtained through X-ray observations and to study their\nscaling relations. However, the scaling schemes used in the literature differ.\nThe present paper aims to clarify this situation by providing a thorough review\nof the scaling laws within the standard model of large-scale structure growth\nand to discus various steps of practical approximations. We derive the scaling\nlaws for X-ray observables and cluster mass within the pure gravitational\nstructure growth scenario. Using N-body simulations we test the recent\nformation approximation used in earlier analytic approaches which involves a\nredshift dependent overdensity parameter.We find this approximation less\nprecise than the use of a fiducial radius based on a fixed overdensity with\nrespect to critical density. Inspired by the comparison of the predicted\nscaling relations with observations we propose a first order modification of\nthe scaling scheme to include the observed effects of hydrodynamics in\nstructure formation. This modification involves a cluster mass dependent gas\nmass fraction. We also discuss the observational results of the reshift\nevolution of the most important scaling relations and find that also a redshift\ndependence of the gas mass to total mass relation has to be invoked within our\nmodification scheme.

Employing the\nthree-parton meson distribution amplitudes from QCD sum rules, we show that\nthis subleading piece amounts only up to few percents of the form factors at\nlarge recoil of the pion. The framework for analyzing three-parton\ncontributions to $B$ meson decays in the $k_T$ factorization is established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 15:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
