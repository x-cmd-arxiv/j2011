These search mechanisms, however, are inadequate,\nsince they cannot be used to specify a natural-language query with rich\nsyntactic and semantic content, which can only be handled by a question\nanswering (QA) system. Furthermore, existing ads websites are incapable of\nevaluating arbitrary Boolean queries or retrieving partiallymatched answers\nthat might be of interest to the user whenever a user's search yields only a\nfew or no results at all. In solving these problems, we present a QA system for\nads, called CQAds, which (i) allows users to post a natural-language question Q\nfor retrieving relevant ads, if they exist, (ii) identifies ads as answers that\npartially-match the requested information expressed in Q, if insufficient or no\nanswers to Q can be retrieved, which are ordered using a similarity-ranking\napproach, and (iii) analyzes incomplete or ambiguous questions to perform the\n\"best guess\" in retrieving answers that \"best match\" the selection criteria\nspecified in Q. CQAds is also equipped with a Boolean model to evaluate Boolean\noperators that are either explicitly or implicitly specified in Q, i.e., with\nor without Boolean operators specified by the users, respectively. CQAds is\neasy to use, scalable to all ads domains, and more powerful than search tools\nprovided by existing ads websites, since its query-processing strategy\nretrieves relevant ads of higher quality and quantity.

In 2010, Byrka et al.\npresented a ln(4)+epsilon approximation based on a hypergraphic LP relaxation,\nbut surprisingly, their analysis does not provide a matching bound on the\nintegrality gap.\n  We take a fresh look at hypergraphic LP relaxations for the Steiner tree\nproblem - one that heavily exploits methods and results from the theory of\nmatroids and submodular functions - which leads to stronger integrality gaps,\nfaster algorithms, and a variety of structural insights of independent\ninterest. More precisely, we present a deterministic ln(4)+epsilon\napproximation that compares against the LP value and therefore proves a\nmatching ln(4) upper bound on the integrality gap.\n  Similarly to Byrka et al., we iteratively fix one component and update the LP\nsolution. However, whereas they solve an LP at every iteration after\ncontracting a component, we show how feasibility can be maintained by a greedy\nprocedure on a well-chosen matroid. Apart from avoiding the expensive step of\nsolving a hypergraphic LP at each iteration, our algorithm can be analyzed\nusing a simple potential function. This gives an easy means to determine\nstronger approximation guarantees and integrality gaps when considering\nrestricted graph topologies. In particular, this readily leads to a 73/60 bound\non the integrality gap for quasi-bipartite graphs.\n  For the case of quasi-bipartite graphs, we present a simple algorithm to\ntransform an optimal solution to the bidirected cut relaxation to an optimal\nsolution of the hypergraphic relaxation, leading to a fast 73/60 approximation\nfor quasi-bipartite graphs.

The mechanism of energy dissipation is assumed to be the\nviscosity and the magnetic diffusivity due to turbulence in the accretion flow.\nIt is assumed that the magnetic diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity are not\nconstant and vary by position and $\\alpha$-prescription is used for them. In\norder to solve the integrated equations that govern the behavior of the\naccretion flow, a self-similar method is used. The solutions show that the\nstructure of accretion flow depends on the magnetic field and the magnetic\ndiffusivity. As, the radial infall velocity and the temperature of the flow\nincrease, and the rotational velocity decreases. Also, the rotational velocity\nfor all selected values of magnetic diffusivity and magnetic field is\nsub-Keplerian. The solutions show that there is a certain amount of magnetic\nfield that the rotational velocity of the flow becomes zero. This amount of the\nmagnetic field depends on the gas properties of the disc, such as adiabatic\nindex and viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, and advection parameters. The\nsolutions show the mass accretion rate increases by adding the magnetic\ndiffusivity and in high magnetic pressure case, the ratio of the mass accretion\nrate to the Bondi accretion rate decreases as magnetic field increases. Also,\nthe study of Lundquist and magnetic Reynolds numbers based on resistivity\nindicates that the linear growth of magnetorotational instability (MRI) of the\nflow decreases by resistivity.

The latter is implemented at the string level by a free\naction on the Euclidean time circle. We show that all Kahler and complex\nstructure moduli involved in the gauge theories geometrically engineered in the\nvicinity of singular loci are lifted by the stringy thermal effective\npotential. The analysis is based on the effective gauged supergravity at low\nenergy, without integrating out the BPS states becoming massless at the\nsingular loci. The universal form of the action in the weak coupling regime at\nlow enough temperature is determined in two cases. Namely the conifold locus,\nas well as a locus where the internal space develops a genus-g curve of A{N-1}\nsingularities, realizing an SU(N) gauge theory coupled to g hypermultiplets in\nthe adjoint. In general, the favored points of stabilization sit at the\nintersection of several singular loci. Thus the entire vector multiplet moduli\nspace can be lifted, together with hypermultiplet moduli. The scalars are\ndynamically stabilized during the cosmological evolution induced by the\nback-reaction of the thermal effective potential. When the universe expands and\nthe temperature T drops, the scalars converge to minima, with damped\noscillations. Moreover, they store an energy density that scales as T^4, which\nnever dominates over radiation. The reason for this is that the mass they\nacquire at one-loop is of order the temperature scale, which is time-dependent.\nAs an example we analyze the type IIA compactification on a Calabi-Yau space\nwith Hodge numbers h{11}=2 and h{12}=128. In this case, both Kahler moduli are\nstabilized, where the internal space develops a node and an enhanced SU(2)\ngauge theory coupled to 2 adjoint hypermultiplets. This shows that in the dual\nthermal heterotic picture on K3xT^2, the torus modulus and the axio-dilaton are\nstabilized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 20:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 22:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We\ninterpret these results in the context of hydrodynamical models for the\nevolution of the remnant. The distributions of fitted temperature and\nionization age, and the implied mass coordinates, are highly peaked and suggest\nthat the ejecta were subjected to multiple secondary shocks following reverse\nshock interaction with ejecta inhomogeneities. Based on the fitted emission\nmeasure and element abundances, and an estimate of the emitting volume, we\nderive masses for the X-ray emitting ejecta and also show the distribution of\nthe mass of various elements over the remnant. An upper limit to the total\nshocked Fe mass visible in X-rays appears to be roughly 0.13 M_sun, which\naccounts for nearly all of the mass expected in Fe ejecta. We find two\npopulations of Fe ejecta, that associated with normal Si-burning and that\npossibly associated with alpha-rich freeze-out, with a mass ratio of\napproximately 2:1. Essentially all of the observed Fe (both components) lies\nwell outside the central regions of the SNR, possibly having been ejected by\nhydrodynamic instabilities during the explosion. We discuss this, and its\nimplications for the neutron star kick.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 20:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In a previous article, we\nintroduced models of jets from truncated disks, i.e. evolved in time numerical\nsimulations based on a radially self-similar MHD solution but including the\neffects of a finite radius of the jet-emitting disk and thus the outflow. In\npaper I of this series, we compared these models with available observational\ndata varying the jet density and velocity, the mass of the protostar and the\nradius of the aforementioned truncation. In paper I, we assumed that the jet\nlies in the plane of the sky. In this paper, we investigate the effect of\ndifferent inclinations of the jet. In order to compare our models with observed\njet widths inferred from recent optical images taken with HST and AO, we create\nagain emission maps in different forbidden lines and from such emission maps,\nwe determine the jet width as the full-width half-maximum of the emission. We\ncan reproduce the jet width of DG Tau and its variations very well and the\nderived inclination of 40$^\\circ$ is in excellent agreement with literature\nvalues of 32--52$^\\circ$. In CW Tau we overestimate the inclination in our\nbest-fit model. In the other objects, we cannot find appropriate models which\nreproduce the variations of the observed jet widths, only the average jet width\nitself is well modeled as in paper I. We conclude that truncation -- i.e.\ntaking into account the finite radius of the jet launching region -- is\nnecessary to reproduce the observed jet widths and our simulations limit the\npossible range of truncation radii. The effects of inclination are important\nfor modeling the intrinsic variations seen in observed jet widths. Our models\ncan be used to infer independently the inclinations in the observed sample,\nhowever, a parameter study with a finer grid of parameters is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We can (i) infer the Hubble constant\nbased on the time-delay technique, (ii) unveil substructures along the l.o.s.\ntoward distant galaxies, and (iii) compare the shape and the slope of baryons\nand dark matter distributions in galaxies. To reach these goals, we need\nhigh-accuracy astrometry and morphology measurements of the lens. In this work,\nwe first present new astrometry for 11 lenses with measured time delays. Using\nMCS deconvolution on NIC2 HST images, we reached an astrometric accuracy of\nabout 1-2.5 mas and an accurate shape measurement of the lens galaxy. Second,\nwe combined these measurements with those of 14 other systems to present new\nmass models of these lenses. This led to the following results: 1) In 4\ndouble-image quasars, we show that the influence of the lens environment on the\ntime delay can easily be quantified and modeled, hence putting these lenses\nwith high priority for time-delay determination. 2) For quadruple-image\nquasars, the difficulty often encountered in reproducing the image positions to\nmilli-arcsec accuracy (astrometric anomaly) is overcome by explicitly including\nthe nearest visible galaxy in the model. However, one anomalous system\n(J1131-1231) does not show any luminous perturber in its vicinity, and three\nothers (WFI2026-4536, WFI2033-4723, and B2045+265) have problematic modeling.\nThese 4 systems are the best candidates for a pertubation by a dark matter\nsubstructure. 3) We find a significant correlation between the PA of the light\nand of the mass distributions in lensing galaxies.

In these events the\nstar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. After completing an\neccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming an\naccretion disk and emitting radiation. The same process may occur on planetary\nscales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. In the Solar System,\ncomets fall directly onto our Sun or onto planets. If the star is a compact\nobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. Indeed, one of the first\nmechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion of\ncomets onto neutron stars in our Galaxy. Here we report that the peculiarities\nof the `Christmas' gamma-ray burst (GRB 101225A) can be explained by a tidal\ndisruption event of a minor body around a Galactic isolated neutron star. This\nresult would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compact\nstellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our Solar System or that\nminor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. A\npeculiar Supernova associated to a GRB may provide an alternative explanation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We discuss how the preexisting turbulence\nmodifies magnetic reconnection and how magnetic reconnection affects the MHD\nturbulent cascade. We show the intrinsic interdependence and interrelation of\nmagnetic turbulence and magnetic reconnection, in particular, that strong\nmagnetic turbulence in 3D requires reconnection and 3D magnetic turbulence\nentails fast reconnection. We follow the approach in Eyink, Lazarian & Vishniac\n2011 to show that the expressions of fast magnetic reconnection in Lazarian &\nVishniac 1999 can be recovered if Richardson diffusion of turbulent flows is\nused instead of ordinary Ohmic diffusion. This does not revive, however, the\nconcept of magnetic turbulent diffusion which assumes that magnetic fields can\nbe mixed up in a passive way down to a very small dissipation scales. On the\ncontrary, we are dealing the reconnection of dynamically important magnetic\nfield bundles which strongly resist bending and have well defined mean\ndirection weakly perturbed by turbulence. We argue that in the presence of\nturbulence the very concept of flux-freezing requires modification. The\ndiffusion that arises from magnetic turbulence can be called reconnection\ndiffusion as it based on reconnection of magnetic field lines. The reconnection\ndiffusion has important implications for the continuous transport processes in\nmagnetized plasmas and for star formation. In addition, fast magnetic\nreconnection in turbulent media induces the First order Fermi acceleration of\nenergetic particles, can explain solar flares and gamma ray bursts. However,\nthe most dramatic consequence of these developments is the fact that the\nstandard flux freezing concept must be radically modified in the presence of\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this presentation, we show the first results from a\nprogram to constrain the state of the outer intracluster medium (ICM) in a\nlarge sample of galaxy clusters, exploiting the strengths of three\ncomplementary X-ray observatories: Suzaku (low, stable background), XMM-Newton\n(high sensitivity), and Chandra (good spatial resolution). By carefully\ncombining observations from the cluster core to beyond r_200, we are able to\nidentify and reduce systematic uncertainties that would impede our spatial and\nspectral analysis using a single telescope. Our sample comprises nine clusters\nat z ~ 0.1-0.2 fully covered in azimuth to beyond r_200, and our analysis\nindicates that the ICM is not in hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster\noutskirts, where we see clear azimuthal variations in temperature and surface\nbrightness. In one of the clusters, we are able to measure the diffuse X-ray\nemission well beyond r_200, and we find that the entropy profile and the gas\nfraction are consistent with expectations from theory and numerical\nsimulations. These results stand in contrast to recent studies which point to\ngas clumping in the outskirts; the extent to which differences of cluster\nenvironment or instrumental effects factor in this difference remains unclear.\nFrom a broader perspective, this project will produce a sizeable fiducial data\nset for detailed comparison with high-resolution numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The presence in the chromosphere of waves with periods longer\nthan the acoustic cutoff period has been ascribed to either strong inclined\nmagnetic fields, or changes in the radiative relaxation time. Our simulations\ninclude a sophisticated treatment of radiative losses, as well as fields with\ndifferent strengths and inclinations. Using Fourier and wavelet analysis\ntechniques, we investigate the periodicity of the waves that travel through the\nchromosphere. We find that the velocity signal is dominated by waves with\nperiods around 5 minutes in regions of strong, inclined field, including at the\nedges of strong flux tubes where the field expands, whereas 3-minute waves\ndominate in regions of weak or vertically oriented fields. Our results show\nthat the field inclination is very important for long-period wave propagation,\nwhereas variations in the radiative relaxation time have little effect.\nFurthermore, we find that atmospheric conditions can vary significantly on\ntimescales of a few minutes, meaning that a Fourier analysis of wave\npropagation can be misleading. Wavelet techniques take variations with time\ninto account and are more suitable analysis tools. Finally, we investigate the\nproperties of jets formed by the propagating waves once they reach the\ntransition region, and find systematic differences between the jets in inclined\nfield regions and those in vertical field regions, in agreement with\nobservations of dynamic fibrils.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-05"}

Basin\nmagnetization signatures and lunar crater size-distributions indicate that the\nlast episode of bombardment at about 3.85 Gyr ago was less extensive than\npreviously thought. We explore the contribution of the primordial Mars-crosser\npopulation to early lunar bombardment. We find that Mars-crosser population\ninitially decays with a 80-Myr half-life, with the long tail of survivors\nclustering on temporarily non-Mars-crossing orbits between 1.8 and 2 AU. These\nsurvivors decay with half-life of about 600 Myr and are progenitors of the\nextant Hungaria asteroid group in the same region. We estimate the primordial\nMars-crosser population contained about 0.01-0.02 Earth masses. Such initial\npopulation is consistent with no lunar basins forming after 3.8 Gya and the\namount of mass in the Hungaria group. As they survive longer and in greater\nnumbers than other primordial populations, Mars-crossers are the best candidate\nfor forming the majority of lunar craters and basins, including most of the\nNectarian system. However, this remnant population cannot produce Imbrium and\nOrientale basins, which formed too late and are too large to be part of a\nsmooth bombardment. We propose that the Imbrian basins and craters formed in a\ndiscrete event, consistent with the basin magnetization signatures and crater\nsize-distributions. This late \"impactor shower\" would be triggered by a\ncollisional disruption of a Vesta-sized body from this primordial Mars-crossing\npopulation (Wetherill, 1975) that was still comparable to the present-day\nasteroid belt a 3.9 Gya.

Determining\nthe region of entropic vectors is an important open problem with many\napplications in information theory. Recently, it has been shown that the\nentropy regions for discrete and continuous random variables, though different,\ncan be determined from one another. An important class of continuous random\nvariables are those that are vector-valued and jointly Gaussian. In this paper\nwe give a full characterization of the convex cone of the entropy region of\nthree jointly Gaussian vector-valued random variables and prove that it is the\nsame as the convex cone of three scalar-valued Gaussian random variables and\nfurther that it yields the entire entropy region of 3 arbitrary random\nvariables.

Those applications need reliability and respect of time constraints.\nThe underlying mechanisms such as MAC and routing must handle such\nrequirements. Our approach to the time constraint problem is to bound the\nhop-count between a node and the sink and the time it takes to do a hop so the\nend-to-end delay can be bounded and the communications are thus real-time. For\nreliability purpose we propose to select forwarder nodes depending on how they\nare connected in the direction of the sink. In order to be able to do so we\nneed a coordinate (or a metric) that gives information on hop-count, that\nallows to strongly differentiate nodes and gives information on the\nconnectivity of each node keeping in mind the intrinsic constraints of WSWs\nsuch as energy consumption, autonomy, etc. Due to the efficiency and\nscalability of greedy routing in WSNs and the financial cost of GPS chips,\nVirtual Coordinate Systems (VCSs) for WSNs have been proposed. A category of\nVCSs is based on the hop-count from the sink, this scheme leads to many nodes\nhaving the same coordinate. The main advantage of this system is that the hops\nnumber of a packet from a source to the sink is known. Nevertheless, it does\nnot allow to differentiate the nodes with the same hop-count. In this report we\npropose a novel hop-count-based VCS which aims at classifying the nodes having\nthe same hop-count depending on their connectivity and at differentiating nodes\nin a 2-hop neighborhood. Those properties make the coordinates, which also can\nbe viewed as a local identifier, a very powerful metric which can be used in\nWSNs mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 07:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-02"}

While leakage currents were measured at temperatures from 400 K\ndown to 85 K. Thus, the threshold voltage - i.e., voltage corresponding to that\nat which the multiplication regime for the leakage current begins - could be\ndetermined as a function of temperature. Finally, an electrical model suited to\nreproduce the dependence of the frequency dependence of capacitance is\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 08:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 17:49:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 12:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2011 19:22:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 15:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Combined with previous interferometric and radial\nvelocity measurements, these new data enable us to improve the characterization\nof the physical orbit of the A subsystem. In particular, we infer updated\ndynamical masses for the primary and the secondary components of 1.55 pm 0.11\nMsun, and 1.293 pm 0.068 Msun, respectively, and an updated orbital parallax\ndistance to the system of 135.7 pm 3.2 pc, all consistent with previous\nestimates. Using the improved orbit, we can calculate the absolute coordinates\nof the barycenter of V773 Tau A at each epoch of our VLBA observations, and fit\nfor its trigonometric parallax and proper motion. This provides a direct\nmeasurement of the distance to the system almost entirely independent of the\norbit modeling. The best fit yields a distance of 129.9 pm 3.2 pc, in good\nagreement (i.e. within 1 sigma) with the distance estimate based on the orbital\nfit. Taking the mean value of the orbital and trigonometric parallaxes, we\nconclude that V773 Tau is located at d =132.8 pm 2.3 pc. The accuracy of this\ndetermination is nearly one order of magnitude better than that of previous\nestimates. In projection, V773 Tau and two other young stars (Hubble 4 and HDE\n283572) recently observed with the VLBA are located toward the dark cloud Lynds\n1495, in the central region of Taurus. These three stars appear to have similar\ntrigonometric parallaxes, radial velocities, and proper motions, and we argue\nthat the weighted mean and dispersion of their distances (d = 131.4 pc and\nsigma_d = 2.4 pc) provide a good estimate of the distance to and depth of Lynds\n1495 and its associated stellar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 09:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We searched for correlations\nbetween the [Fe/H] value and both the observed amplitudes and amplitude related\nparameters.\n  The amplitude of the Cepheid pulsation slightly decreases with increasing\niron abundance.

In this\ncontribution, we study the stability and dynamics of a two-stage gene\nexpression switch within a probabilistic framework inspired by the properties\nof the Pu/Gata toggle switch in myeloid progenitor cells. We focus on low mRNA\nnumbers, high protein abundance and monomeric transcription factor binding.\nContrary to the expectation from a deterministic description, this switch shows\ncomplex multi-attractor dy- namics without autoactivation and cooperativity.\nMost importantly, the four attractors of the system, which only emerge in a\nprobabilistic two-stage description, can be identified with committed and\nprimed states in cell differentiation. We first study the dynamics of the\nsystem and infer the mechanisms that move the system between attractors using\nboth the quasi-potential and the probability flux of the system. Second, we\nshow that the residence times of the system in one of the committed attractors\nare geometrically distributed and provide an analytical expression of the\ndistribution.

Finally, we study the implications of\nthis distribution for the stability of a switch and discuss the influence of\nthe stability on a specific cell differentiation mechanism. Our model explains\nlineage priming and proposes the need of either high protein numbers or long\nterm modifications such as chromatin remodeling to achieve stable cell fate\ndecisions.

The mathematical analysis\nunderlying their computation assumes that occurrences of words under interest\ndo not overlap. We relax here this assumption by use of an automata approach.\nIn an alphabet of size 4 like the DNA alphabet, most words have no or a low\nautocorrelation; therefore, globally, our results confirm those of Behrens and\nVingron. The outcome is quite different when considering highly autocorrelated\nk-mers; in this case, the autocorrelation pushes down the probability of\noccurrence of these k-mers at generation 1 and, consequently, increases the\nwaiting time for apparition of these k-mers up to 40%. An analysis of existing\nTF binding sites unveils a significant proportion of k-mers exhibiting\nautocorrelation. Thus, our computations based on automata greatly improve the\naccuracy of predicting waiting times for the emergence of TF binding sites to\nappear during DNA evolution. We do the computation in the Bernoulli or M0\nmodel; computations in the M1 model, a Markov model of order 1, are more costly\nin terms of time and memory but should produce similar results. While Behrens\nand Vingron considered specifically promoters of length 1000, we extend the\nresults to promoters of any size; we exhibit the property that the probability\nthat a k-mer occurs at generation time 1 while being absent at time 0 behaves\nlinearly with respect to the length of the promoter, which induces a hyperbolic\nbehaviour of the waiting time of any k-mer with respect to the length of the\npromoter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 10:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-02"}

The system is modeled\nas a three-mode system, two orthogonal polariton modes representing the coupled\noptical lattice and the cavity mode, and one mechanical mode representing the\noscillating mirror. We examine separately the cases of two-mode and three-mode\ninteractions which are distinguished by a suitable tuning of the mechanical\nmode to the polariton mode frequencies. In the two-mode case, we find that the\noccurrence of entanglement between one of the polariton modes and the\nmechanical mode is highly sensitive to the presence of the first-order\ncoherence between the modes. In particular, the creation of the first-order\ncoherence among the modes is achieved at the expense of entanglement between\nthe modes. In the three-mode case, we show that no entanglement is created\nbetween the independent polariton modes if both modes are coupled to the\nmechanical mode by the parametric interaction. There is no entanglement between\nthe polaritons even if the oscillating mirror is damped by a squeezed vacuum\nfield. The interaction creates the first-order coherence between the polaritons\nand the degree of coherence can, in principle, be as large as unity. This\ndemonstrates that the oscillating mirror can establish the first-order\ncoherence between two independent thermal modes. A further analysis shows that\ntwo independent thermal modes can be made entangled in the system only when one\nof the modes is coupled to the intermediate mode by a parametric interaction\nand the other is coupled by a linear-mixing interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 13:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 06:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

In this work, we present\nsemi-streaming algorithms that perform one or two passes over the input stream\nfor maximum matching with no restrictions on the input graph, and for the\nimportant special case of bipartite graphs that we refer to as maximum\nbipartite matching (MBM). The Greedy matching algorithm performs one pass over\nthe input and outputs a $1/2$ approximation. Whether there is a better one-pass\nalgorithm has been an open question since the appearance of the first paper on\nstreaming algorithms for matching problems in 2005 [Feigenbaum et al., SODA\n2005]. We make the following progress on this problem:\n  In the one-pass setting, we show that there is a deterministic semi-streaming\nalgorithm for MBM with expected approximation factor $1/2+0.005$, assuming that\nedges arrive one by one in (uniform) random order. We extend this algorithm to\ngeneral graphs, and we obtain a $1/2+0.003$ approximation.\n  In the two-pass setting, we do not require the random arrival order\nassumption (the edge stream is in arbitrary order). We present a simple\nrandomized two-pass semi-streaming algorithm for MBM with expected\napproximation factor $1/2 + 0.019$. Furthermore, we discuss a more involved\ndeterministic two-pass semi-streaming algorithm for MBM with approximation\nfactor $1/2 + 0.019$ and a generalization of this algorithm to general graphs\nwith approximation factor $1/2 + 0.0071$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 14:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 07:23:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 14:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

The general consensus is that the strength of\nthe RKKY interaction in graphene decays as 1/D3 or faster, where D is the\nseparation between magnetic moments. Such an unusually fast decay for a\n2-dimensional system suggests that the RKKY interaction may be too short ranged\nto be experimentally observed in graphene. Here we show in a mathematically\ntransparent form that a far more long ranged interaction arises when the\nmagnetic moments are taken out of their equilibrium positions and set in\nmotion. We not only show that this dynamic version of the RKKY interaction in\ngraphene decays far more slowly but also propose how it can be observed with\ncurrently available experimental methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2011 15:14:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 10:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-09"}

In the first part of\nthe thesis we analyze the bounds on the spectrum of Composite Higgs Models\n(CHM) that come from flavor observables. In the second part we propose a novel\nstrategy to discover a heavy gluon ($G^*$) and heavy fermions at the LHC. We do\nso by means of simple two-site effective Lagrangians, which could also be used\nin further phenomenological studies on CHM. From the analysis of the bounds on\nthe CHM spectrum, we derive an important constraint on the masses of the heavy\nfermions which does not depend on the flavor structure of the sector beyond the\nSM. This bound is obtained from the infrared contribution to $b \\to s\\gamma$\ninduced by the flavor-conserving effective vertex $Wt_Rb_R$. We find that the\npresence of a custodial symmetry can play a role in protecting this effective\ncoupling. Studying the heavy colored vectors phenomenology, we find that heavy\ncomposite fermions have a great impact on the phenomenology of heavy composite\ngluon at the LHC. If the composite gluon is heavier than the composite\nfermions, as flavor observables seem to suggest, the search in the channels\nwhere $G^*$ decays into one heavy fermion plus its Standard Model partner is\nvery promising, with the possibility for both the $G^*$ and heavy fermions to\nbe discovered at the early stage of the LHC.

A reference by a formula to its own provability is shown\nto be a recurrence relation, which can be either interpreted as such to\ngenerate a discrete dynamical system, or interpreted in a static way to create\nan additional simultaneous equation. In this framework the truth values of\nlogical formulas and other polynomial objectives have complex data structures:\nsets of elementary values, or dynamical systems that generate sets of infinite\nsequences of such solution-value sets. Besides the routine result that a\nformula has a definite elementary value, these data structures encode several\nexceptions: formulas that are ambiguous, unsatisfiable, unsteady, or\ncontingent. These exceptions represent several semantically different types of\nundecidability; none causes any fundamental problem for mathematics.
