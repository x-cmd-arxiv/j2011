This\ntechnique extends the deterministic equivalent approach for the study of\nfunctionals of large random matrices to a broader class of random matrix models\nwhich naturally arise as channel models in wireless communications. We present\ntwo specific applications: First, we consider a multi-hop amplify-and-forward\n(AF) MIMO relay channel with noise at each stage and derive deterministic\napproximations of the mutual information after the Kth hop. Second, we study a\nMIMO multiple access channel (MAC) where the channel between each transmitter\nand the receiver is represented by the double-scattering channel model. We\nprovide deterministic approximations of the mutual information, the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and sum-rate with\nminimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detection and derive the asymptotically\noptimal precoding matrices. In both scenarios, the approximations can be\ncomputed by simple and provably converging fixed-point algorithms and are shown\nto be almost surely tight in the limit when the number of antennas at each node\ngrows infinitely large. Simulations suggest that the approximations are\naccurate for realistic system dimensions. The technique of iterative\ndeterministic equivalents can be easily extended to other channel models of\ninterest and is, therefore, also a new contribution to the field of random\nmatrix theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 16:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

As an alternative to\nthe background subtraction proposed in BeadStudio which leads to an important\nloss of information by generating negative values, a background correction\nmethod modeling the observed intensities as the sum of the exponentially\ndistributed signal and normally distributed noise has been developed.\nNevertheless, Wang and Ye (2011) display a kernel-based estimator of the signal\ndistribution on Illumina BeadArrays and suggest that a gamma distribution would\nrepresent a better modeling of the signal density. Hence, the\nnormal-exponential modeling may not be appropriate for Illumina data and\nbackground corrections derived from this model may lead to wrong estimation.\nResults: We propose a more flexible modeling based on a gamma distributed\nsignal and a normal distributed background noise and develop the associated\nbackground correction.

In\nthis form, it was first used to implement an interactive modeling tool for\ngalaxy collisions; tests with artificial data showed that the morphology and\nkinematics of merging galaxies strongly constrain their initial conditions.\nThis tool is now being applied to real galaxies. More recently, IDENTIKIT has\nbeen used to develop a mapping from the present state of a tidal encounter back\nto the initial conditions; this offers a way to partly automate the search for\ndynamical models of galaxy encounters. Finally, IDENTIKIT's theoretical\napplications include a comprehensive way to evaluate the mass and extent of\ntidal features as functions of halo structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 20:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

Microlensing surveys may help on\nthis purpose since the lensing mechanism is independent of the emission\nproperties of the lens. Indeed, several black hole candidates deriving through\nmicrolensing observations have been reported in the literature. The\nidentification of counterparts, especially in the X-rays, would be a strong\nargument in favor of the compact nature of these lenses.\n  We perform a cross-correlation between the catalogs of microlensing events by\nthe OGLE, MACHO and MOA teams, and those of X-rays sources from XMM-Newton and\nChandra satellites. Based on our previous work, we select only microlensing\nevents longer than 100 days, which should contain a large fraction of lenses as\ncompact objects. Our matching criterion takes into account the positional\ncoincidence in the sky.\n  We find a single match between a microlensing event OGLE 2004-BLG-81 and the\nX-ray source 2XMM J180540.5-273427. The angular separation is \\sim 0.5\narc-seconds, well inside the 90% error box of the X-ray source. The hardness\nratios reported in the 2XMM catalog suggest a hard spectrum with a peak between\n2 and 4.5 keV or a softer but highly absorbed source. Moreover the microlensing\nevent is not fully constrained, and possible association with a flaring CV or a\nRS CVn star have been suggested as well.\n  The small angular separation is a strong indicator that 2XMM J180540.5-273427\nis the X-ray counterpart of the OGLE event. However, the uncertainties on both\nthe nature of lensed system and the lens itself challenge the interpretation of\n2XMM J180540.5-273427 as the first confirmed isolated black hole identified so\nfar. In any case, it probes the diagnostic capacity of microlensing surveys and\nopen the path for further identifications of black hole or neutron star\ncandidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 23:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Similarly, Bayesian methods are increasingly\nused to obtain efficient likelihood-based inference. However, to date, there\nhas been only limited use of Bayesian approaches in the formulation and\nestimation of copula models. This article aims to address this shortcoming in\ntwo ways. First, to introduce copula models and aspects of copula theory that\nare especially relevant for a Bayesian analysis. Second, to outline Bayesian\napproaches to formulating and estimating copula models, and their advantages\nover alternative methods. Copulas covered include Archimedean, copulas\nconstructed by inversion, and vine copulas; along with their interpretation as\ntransformations. A number of parameterisations of a correlation matrix of a\nGaussian copula are considered, along with hierarchical priors that allow for\nBayesian selection and model averaging for each parameterisation. Markov chain\nMonte Carlo sampling schemes for fitting Gaussian and D-vine copulas, with and\nwithout selection, are given in detail. The relationship between the prior for\nthe parameters of a D-vine, and the prior for a correlation matrix of a\nGaussian copula, is discussed. Last, it is shown how to compute Bayesian\ninference when the data are discrete-valued using data augmentation. This\napproach generalises popular Bayesian methods for the estimation of models for\nmultivariate binary and other ordinal data to more general copula models.\nBayesian data augmentation has substantial advantages over other methods of\nestimation for this class of models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 23:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

This approach, called \"Light-Front Holography\", successfully\ndescribes the spectroscopy of light-quark meson and baryons, their elastic and\ntransition form factors, and other hadronic properties. The bound-state\nSchrodinger and Dirac equations of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model predict linear\nRegge trajectories which have the same slope in orbital angular momentum L and\nradial quantum number n for both mesons and baryons. Light-front holography\nconnects the fifth-dimensional coordinate of AdS space z to an invariant impact\nseparation variable zeta in 3+1 space at fixed light-front time. A key feature\nis the determination of the frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of\nhadrons -- the relativistic analogs of the Schrodinger wavefunctions of atomic\nphysics which allow one to compute form factors, transversity distributions,\nspin properties of the valence quarks, jet hadronization, and other hadronic\nobservables. One thus obtains a one-parameter color-confining model for hadron\nphysics at the amplitude level.

A\nparticularly appealing property of minimum-disparity methods is that while they\nyield robustness with a breakdown point of 1/2, the resulting parameter\nestimates are also efficient when the posited probabilistic model is correct.\nWe demonstrate that a similar property holds for disparity-based Bayesian\ninference.

Recent non-parametric (principal component) analyses\nsuggest that a few principal components explain a large fraction of the scatter\nin halo properties. The main principal component is closely linked with\nconcentration, which in turn is known to be related to the mass accretion\nhistory of the halo. Here we examine more generally the connection between mass\naccretion history and structural parameters. The space of mass accretion\nhistories has principal components of its own. We find that the strongest two\ncan be interpreted as the overall age of the halo and the acceleration or\ndeceleration of growth at late times. These two components only account for\n$\\sim70$%\\ of the scatter in mass accretions histories however, due to the\nstochastic effect of major mergers. Relating structural parameters to formation\nhistory, we find that concentration correlates strongly with the early history\nof the halo, while relaxation correlates with the late history. We examine the\ninferences about formation history that can be drawn by splitting haloes into\nsubsamples, based on observable properties such as concentration and shape at\nsome final time.

For this\nclassifier, most methods find the weight and bias in batch-mode learning, which\nmakes them inefficient for large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose an\nonline framework using accelerated proximal gradient method. This framework has\na main advantage in memory cost. In addition, as a result of the regularization\nformulation of matrix classification, the Lipschitz constant was given\nexplicitly, and hence the step size estimation of general proximal gradient\nmethod was omitted in our approach. Experiments on real data sets for\nlaugh/non-laugh and applause/non-applause classification indicate that this\nnovel framework is effective and noise robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 05:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

Informally, there are $n$ players sitting\non the network nodes, which attempt to establish a reciprocal communication by\nactivating, incurring a certain cost, any of their incident links. The goal of\neach player is to have all the other nodes as close as possible in the\nresulting network, while buying as few links as possible. According to this\nintuition, any model of the game must then appropriately address a balance\nbetween these two conflicting objectives. Motivated by the fact that a player\nmight have a strong requirement about its centrality in the network, in this\npaper we introduce a new setting in which if a player maintains its (either\nmaximum or average) distance to the other nodes within a given associated\nbound, then its cost is simply equal to the number of activated edges,\notherwise its cost is unbounded. We study the problem of understanding the\nstructure of associated pure Nash equilibria of the resulting games, that we\ncall MaxBD and SumBD, respectively. For both games, we show that computing the\nbest response of a player is an NP-hard problem. Next, we show that when\ndistance bounds associated with players are non-uniform, then equilibria can be\narbitrarily bad. On the other hand, for MaxBD, we show that when nodes have a\nuniform bound $R$ on the maximum distance, then the Price of Anarchy (PoA) is\nlower and upper bounded by 2 and $O(n^{\\frac{1}{\\lfloor\\log_3 R\\rfloor+1}})$\nfor $R \\geq 3$, while for the interesting case R=2, we are able to prove that\nthe PoA is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ and $O(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$. For the uniform SumBD\nwe obtain similar (asymptotically) results, and moreover we show that the PoA\nbecomes constant as soon as the bound on the average distance is\n$n^{\\omega(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\log n}})}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 08:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

The realistic mass accretion history\nof a dark matter halo taking into account its fast and slow growth is\nconsidered by imposing suitable initial conditions and isotropized\nvirializations for the spherical collapse process. The dark energy component is\ntreated as a perfect fluid described by two important parameters, the equation\nof state parameter $w$ and the sound speed $c_s$. Quintessence models with\n$w>-1$ are analyzed. We adopt the Newtonian gauge to describe the spacetime\nwhich is perturbed mainly by the formation of a dark matter halo. It is found\nthat the dark energy density perturbation $\\delta_{DE}$ depends on $w$ and\n$c_s$, and its behavior follows closely the gravitational potential $\\Phi$ of\nthe dark matter halo with $\\delta_{DE}\\approx -(1+w)\\Phi/c_s^2$. For $w>-1$,\nthe dark energy perturbation presents a clustering behavior with\n$\\delta_{DE}>0$ during the entire formation of the dark matter halo, from\nlinear to nonlinear and virialized stages.

We investigate the\nrelation between the X-ray activity, rotation, and Rossby number for a sample\nof 82 young stars in the ~3 Myr old cluster IC 348. We use the data of four\nChandra observations of IC 348 to derive the X-ray luminosities of the young\nstars. The young stars in IC 348 show no correlation between X-ray activity and\nrotation period. Considering the Rossby numbers, nearly all IC 348 stars are in\nthe saturated regime of the activity-rotation relation defined by main-sequence\nstars. Searching for possible super-saturation effects, we find a marginal (but\nstatistically in-significant) trend that the stars with the smallest Rossby\nnumbers show slightly lower X-ray activity levels. We compare the dispersion of\nfractional X-ray luminosities of the stars in the saturated rotation regime in\nIC 348 to that seen in younger and older stellar populations. The scatter seen\nin the ~3 Myr old IC 348 is considerably smaller than for the ~1 Myr old ONC,\nbut, at the same time, considerably larger than the dispersion seen in the ~30\nMyr old cluster NGC 2547 and in main-sequence stars. The results of our X-ray\nanalysis of IC 348 show that neither the rotation rates nor the\npresence/absence of circumstellar disks are of fundamental importance for\ndetermining the level of X-ray activity in TTS. Our results suggest that the\nscatter of X-ray activity levels shown by the fast-rotating members of young\nclusters decreases with the age of the stellar population.

A partner action for higher-spin fields appears in\nthe doublet version of the fermionic matter sector. As an application of the\nproposed formalism, a gauge-invariant Chern-Simons action in four dimensions is\nbuilt up; a second order quadratic Yang-Mills type action can also be defined\nin this doublet framework, but we show that they can only be invariant under a\nLie subgroup of our extended gauge symmetry.

To answer these challenging questions we have developed a\ntheoretical framework that allows description and reproduction of Dynamic\nTension Spectroscopy (DTS) observations. The kinetics of the membrane rupture\nunder ramps of surface tension is described as a combination of initial pore\nformation followed by Brownian process of the pore radius crossing the\ntime-dependent energy barrier. We present the formalism and derive (formal)\nanalytical expression of the survival probability describing the fate of the\nmembrane under DTS conditions. Using numerical simulations for the membrane\nprepared in an initial state with a given distribution of times for pore\nnucleation, we have studied the membrane lifetime (or inverse of rupture rate)\nand distribution of membrane surface tension at rupture as a function of\nmembrane characteristics like pore nucleation rate, the energy barrier to\nfailure and tension loading rate. It is found that simulations reproduce main\nfeatures of the experimental data, particularly, the pore nucleation and pore\nsize diffusion controlled limits of membrane rupture dynamics. This approach\ncan also be applied to processes of permeation and pore opening in membranes\n(electroporation, membrane disruption by antimicrobial peptides, vesicle\nfusion).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 11:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Westerlund I is the richest young cluster currently known in our\nGalaxy, making it one of the most massive clusters for which we can resolve the\nindividual stars even in the crowded centre. This makes it an ideal target to\nassess whether massive clusters formed currently will remain bound or will\ndisperse and contribute significantly to the stellar field population. Aims.\nHere we report a measurement of the radial velocity dispersion of Westerlund I\nto explore whether the cluster is currently in virial equilibrium, if it is in\nthe process of collapse or if it is expanding and dispersing into the field.\nMethods. We obtained MIKE/Magellan high resolution optical spectra of 22 post\nmain-sequence stars jn Westerlund I for 2 or 3 epochs with a maximum baseline\nof about one year.

We calculate the velocity\ndispersion from the cross correlation of five yellow hypergiants and one\nluminous blue variable, that show little radial velocity variations between\nepochs and have many spectral features in common. After taking into account the\neffect of small number statistics and undetected binaries, we estimate the\nvelocity dispersion for the massive stars in Westerlund I to be 2.1 (+3.3,\n-2.1) km s-1. For several different assumptions concerning possible mass\nsegregation and the elongation of the cluster, we find that Westerlund I is\nsubvirial at the 90% confidence level. Conclusions. We can rule out that the\ncluster is significantly supervirial at the 97% confidence level, indicating\nthat Westerlund I is currently bound. This implies that Westerlund I has\nsurvived past the point where any gas expulsion has taken place and is expected\nto survive for billions of years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 13:07:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 18:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

For both gate voltage and magnetic field sweeps and\nT>10 K the transition width goes as T^{-\\kappa} with exponent \\kappa ~0.42.\nThis universal scaling exponent agrees well with those found in III-V\nheterojunctions with short range alloy disorders and in exfoliated graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 14:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 01:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In 1968, E. A. Bredihina established an analogous result for\nfunctions belonging to the Stepanov space of almost periodic functions $S^2$\nwhose Fourier exponents satisfy a natural separation condition. Here, the\nmaximal operator corresponding to dyadic partial summation of almost periodic\nFourier series is bounded on the Stepanov spaces $S^{2^k}$, $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$\nfor functions satisfying the same condition; Bredihina's result follows as a\nconsequence. In the process of establishing these bounds, some general results\nare obtained which will facilitate further work on operator bounds and\nconvergence issues in Stepanov spaces. These include a boundedness theorem for\nthe Hilbert transform and a theorem of Littlewood--Paley type. An improvement\nof \"$S^{2^k}$, $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$\" to \"$S^p$, $p \\in (1, \\infty)$\" is also seen\nto follow from a natural conjecture on the boundedness of the Hilbert\ntransform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 14:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

In this diagram, bursts that\nobey the Amati relation must lie above some limiting line, although\nobservational scatter is expected to be substantial. We confirm that early\nbursts with spectroscopic redshifts are consistent with this limit. But, we\nfind that the bursts from BATSE, Swift, Suzaku, and Konus are all greatly in\nviolation of the limit. In the Sbolo-Epeak,obs diagram, we find that every\nsatellite has a greatly different distribution. This requires that selection\neffects are dominating these distributions, which we identify. For detector\nselections, the trigger threshold and the threshold to measure Epeak,obs\ncombine to make a diagonal cutoff with the position of this cutoff varying\ngreatly detector to detector. For selection effects due to the intrinsic\nproperties of the burst population, the distribution of Epeak,obs makes for\nbursts with low and high values to be rare, while the fluence distribution\nmakes bright bursts uncommon. For a poor threshold, the combination of\nselection effects serves to allow only bursts within a region along the limit\nto be measured; these bursts will then appear to follow an Amati relation.\nTherefore, the Amati relation is an artifact of selection effects within the\nburst population and the detector. Therefore, the Amati relation should not be\nused for cosmological tasks. This failure is in no way prejudicial against the\nother luminosity relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 14:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The broad\nband continuum is well fitted by a classical combination of black body and\nComptonized emission. The continuum shape and the high flux of the source\n(L/L_Edd\\sim0.16) are consistent with a \"high state\" of the source. We do not\nfind significant evidence of iron emission at energies >=6.4 keV. The soft\nX-ray spectrum contain a number of absorption features. Here we focus on the\ncold-mildly ionized gas. The neutral gas column density is N_H\\sim1.63x10^21\ncm^-2. The detailed study of the oxygen and iron edge reveals that those\nelements are depleted, defined here as the ratio between dust and the total ISM\ncold phase, by a factor 0.20\\pm0.02 and 0.87\\pm0.14, respectively. Using the\navailable dust models, the best fit points to a major contribution of Mg-rich\nsilicates, with metallic iron inclusion. Although we find that a large fraction\nof Fe is in dust form, the fit shows that Fe-rich silicates are disfavored. The\nmeasured Mg:Fe ratio is 2.0\\pm0.3. Interestingly, this modeling may point to a\nwell studied dust constituent (GEMS), sometimes proposed as a silicate\nconstituent in our Galaxy. Oxygen and iron are found to be slightly over- and\nunder-abundant, respectively (1.23 and 0.85 times the solar value) along this\nline of sight. We also report the detection of two absorption lines,\ntentatively identified as part of an outflow of mildly ionized gas\n(\\xi\\sim-0.5) at a velocity of \\sim1200 km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 14:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
