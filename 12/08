While the exchange bias, coercivity, and exchange energy are\ngreatest when the buffer layer material is (111) oriented Cu, amorphous Ta\nbuffers allow the mu-metal to retain more of its soft magnetic character.

A large list of common proper motion stars selected from\nthe AGK3 were monitored with the CORAVEL spectrovelocimeter, in order to\nprepare a sample of physical binaries with very wide separations. Sixty-six\nstars received special attention, since their RV seemed to be variable. These\nstars were monitored over several years in order to derive the elements of\ntheir spectroscopic orbits.

Thirteen SB2\norbits were thus calculated.\n  The orbital elements were eventually obtained for 52 spectroscopic binaries\n(SB), two of them making a triple system. Forty SB received their first orbit,\nand the orbital elements were improved for 10 others.

After an introduction to superconductors\nwith possible odd-parity pairing, accumulated evidence for the pairing symmetry\nof Sr2RuO4 is examined. Then, significant recent progress on the theoretical\napproaches to the superconducting pairing by Coulomb repulsion is reviewed. A\nsection is devoted to some experimental properties of Sr2RuO4 that seem to defy\nsimple explanations in terms of currently available spin-triplet scenario. The\nnext section deals with some new developments using eutectic boundaries and\nmicro-crystals, which reveals novel superconducting phenomena related to chiral\nedge states, odd-frequency pairing states, and half-fluxoid states. Some of\nthese properties are intimately connected with the properties as a topological\nsuperconductor.

In particular, it is\nhighly relevant the dependence of viscoelasticity on the temperature. For\npolystyrene it is known that the glass transition temperature is dependent on\nthe film thickness. At present, there is wide agreement on the importance of\nthe two interfaces that the films form with the air and with the substrate. The\nrelevance of molecular entanglement has been also stressed for the case of\nsuspended films. However, the role of molecular entanglement on the glass\ntransition temperature of supported films still remains elusive. In order to\ninvestigate the viscoelastic properties of thin films on the nanoscale, we have\nemployed a scanning probe microscope suitably modified in order to monitor the\nindentation of a tip into a polymeric film during a given lapse of time with\nthe application of a constant load. Thin polystyrene films have been prepared\non a range of different substrates: native silicon oxide, hydrogen-terminated\nsilicon and polystyrene brushes. In particular, we have considered polystyrene\nmolecules with molecular weight values below and above the critical value for\nthe occurrence of molecular entanglement. We find that, for samples where\nmolecular entanglement can occur accompanied by a strong interaction with the\nsubstrate either by means of chemical bonds or physisorption, the glass\ntransition temperature of thin films increases back to values comparable with\nthose of thick films. This phenomenon is envisioned to be of great relevance in\nthose cases where one needs to improve the adhesion and/or to control the\nviscoelastic properties of thin films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 17:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-08"}

The introduced model is easier to investigate\nanalytically than the original inviscid Hasegawa-Mima model, as it has a nicer\nmathematical structure. The resemblance between this model and the Euler\nequations of inviscid incompressible fluids inspired us to adapt the techniques\nand ideas introduced for the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional Euler\nequations to prove the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for our\nmodel. Moreover, we prove the continuous dependence on initial data of\nsolutions for the pseudo-Hasegawa-Mima model. These are the first results on\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions for a model that is related to the\nthree-dimensional inviscid Hasegawa-Mima equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 17:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Full Stokes vectors were acquired with\nTIP-II in a spectral range which comprises the chromospheric He I 10830 A\nmultiplet and the photospheric Si I 10827 A line. An AR filament (that was\nformed before our observing run) was detected in the He I absorption images on\n2005 July 3rd. The chromospheric vector magnetic field in this portion of the\nfilament was strongly sheared whereas the photospheric field lines underneath\nhad an inverse polarity configuration. From July 3rd to July 5th, an opening\nand closing of the polarities at either side of the polarity inversion line\n(PIL) was recorded, resembling the recently discovered process of the sliding\ndoor effect seen by Hinode. During this time, a newly created region that\ncontained pores and orphan penumbrae at the PIL was observed.On July 5th, a\nnormal polarity configuration was inferred from the chromospheric spectra,\nwhile strongly sheared field lines aligned with the PIL were found in the\nphotosphere. In this same data set, the spine of the filament is also observed\nin a different portion of the FOV and is clearly mapped by the Silicon line\ncore. The inferred vector magnetic fields of the filament suggest a flux rope\ntopology. Furthermore, the observations indicate that the filament is divided\nin two parts, one which lies in the chromosphere and another one that stays\ntrapped in the photosphere. Therefore, only the top of the helical structure is\nseen by the Helium lines. The pores and orphan penumbrae at the PIL appear to\nbe the photospheric counterpart of the extremely low-lying filament. We suggest\nthat orphan penumbrae are formed in very narrow PILs of compact ARs and are the\nphotospheric manifestation of flux ropes in the photosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 19:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We suggest a new approach, using\nthe number of patches in the population as a large parameter. This approach\ndoes not require that the number of individuals per patch is large, neither is\nit necessary to assume a time-scale separation between local population\ndynamics and migration. Our approach makes it possible to accurately describe\nthe dynamics of metapopulations consisting of many small patches. We focus on\nmetapopulations on the brink of extinction. We estimate the time to extinction\nand describe the most likely path to extinction. We find that the logarithm of\nthe time to extinction is proportional to the product of two vectors, a vector\ncharacterising the distribution of patch population sizes in the quasi-steady\nstate, and a vector -- related to Fisher's reproduction vector -- that\nquantifies the sensitivity of the quasi-steady state distribution to\ndemographic fluctuations. We compare our analytical results to stochastic\nsimulations of the model, and discuss the range of validity of the analytical\nexpressions. By identifying fast and slow degrees of freedom in the\nmetapopulation dynamics, we show that the dynamics of large metapopulations\nclose to extinction is approximately described by a deterministic equation\noriginally proposed by Levins (1969). We were able to compute the rates in\nLevins' equation in terms of the parameters of our stochastic, individual-based\nmodel. It turns out, however, that the interpretation of the dynamical variable\ndepends strongly on the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of the\npatches. Only when the growth rate and the carrying capacity are large does the\nslow variable correspond to the number of patches, as envisaged by Levins.

Two sources\nof contribution to the cosmic entanglement entropy are considered: one from the\nhomogeneous background where the observable and the unobservable regions of the\nuniverse are entangled and the other from the inhomogeneous cosmological\nperturbations where different modes are entangled. We find that the homogeneous\ncontribution grows exponentially at the very beginning of the inflation, but\ndecreases during the radiation dominant era. Conversely, that from the\ncosmological perturbation is found to decrease at first and then increase after\nreaching a minimum value. The net result is that the total entanglement entropy\nreaches a minimum at an early stage of the inflation and then increases\nthroughout most of the inflation and the entire radiation dominant era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 20:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-08"}

For comparison, each\ngalaxy was also simulated using a 'lower feedback' (LF) model which has\nstrength comparable to other implementations in the literature. The 'MAGICC\nfeedback' (MF) model has a higher incidence of massive stars and an\napproximately two times higher energy input per supernova. Apart from the\nlow-mass halo using LF, each galaxy exhibits a metal-enriched CGM that extends\nto approximately the virial radius. A significant fraction of this gas has been\nheated in supernova explosions in the disc and subsequently ejected into the\nCGM where it is predicted to give rise to substantial O VI absorption. The\nsimulations do not yet address the question of what happens to the O VI when\nthe galaxies stop forming stars. Our models also predict a reservoir of cool H\nI clouds that show strong Ly\\alpha absorption to several hundred kpc. Comparing\nthese models to recent surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope, we find that\nonly the MF models have sufficient O VI and H I gas in the CGM to reproduce the\nobserved distributions. In separate analyses, these same MF models also show\nbetter agreement with other galaxy observables (e.g. rotation curves, surface\nbrightness profiles and H I gas distribution). We infer that the CGM is the\ndominant reservoir of baryons for galaxy haloes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 15:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 10:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-03"}

Patch or grid based AMR often\nemploys ghost cells to decouple the hyperbolic advances of each grid on a given\nrefinement level. This decoupling allows each grid to be advanced\nindependently.

The radial velocity variations show significant\ncurvature (change in the acceleration) including an inflection point. We have\nalso obtained a recent image of HR7672B with NIRC2 at Keck.

A game in SF models the case where players are uniquely\ninterested in the satisfaction of some individual performance constraints,\ninstead of individual performance optimization. Under this formulation, the\nnotion of equilibrium corresponds to the situation where all players can\nsimultaneously satisfy their individual constraints. The notion of SE, models\nthe problem of QoS provisioning in decentralized self-configuring networks.\nHere, radio devices are satisfied if they are able to provide the requested\nQoS. Within this framework, the concept of SE is formalized for both pure and\nmixed strategies considering finite sets of players and actions. In both cases,\nsufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the SE are presented.\nWhen multiple SE exist, we introduce the idea of effort or cost of satisfaction\nand we propose a refinement of the SE, namely the efficient SE (ESE).

In most cases the\nconversion factor is assumed to be close to that of giant molecular clouds\n(GMCs) in the Milky Way, except possibly for mergers and star-bursting\ngalaxies. However, there are physical grounds to expect that it should also\ndepend on the gas metallicity, surface density, and strength of the\ninterstellar radiation field. The XCO factor may also depend on the scale on\nwhich CO emission is averaged due to effects of limited resolution. We study\nthe dependence of X_CO on gas properties and averaging scale using a model that\nis based on a combination of results of sub-pc scale magneto-hydrodynamic\nsimulations and on the gas distribution from self-consistent cosmological\nsimulations of galaxy formation. Our model predicts a value of X_CO that is\nconsistent with the Galactic value for interstellar medium conditions typical\nfor the Milky Way. For such conditions the predicted X_CO varies by only a\nfactor of two for gas surfaced densities in the range \\sim 50 - 500 M_sun /\npc^2. However, the model also predicts that more generally on the scale of\nGMCs, X_CO is a strong function of metallicity, and depends on the column\ndensity and the interstellar UV flux. We show explicitly that neglecting these\ndependencies in observational estimates can strongly bias the inferred\ndistribution of H2 column densities of molecular clouds to have a narrower and\noffset range compared to the true distribution. We find that when averaged on\n\\sim kpc scales the X-factor depends only weakly on radiation field and column\ndensity, but is still a strong function of metallicity. The predicted\nmetallicity dependence can be approximated as X_CO \\sim Z^{-{\\gamma}} with\n{\\gamma} ~ 0.5 - 0.8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 23:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This system can be realized, as a\nspatial-domain one, in optics, and also in Bose-Einstein condensates of\nquasi-particles in solid-state settings. Recently, exact solutions were found\nfor localized modes pinned to the single HS represented by the delta-function.\nThe present paper reports analytical and numerical solutions for coexisting\ntwo- and multi-peak modes, which may be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect\nto the underlying HS pair. Stability of the modes is explored through\nsimulations of their perturbed evolution. The sign of the cubic nonlinearity\nplays a crucial role: in the case of the self-focusing, only the fundamental\nsymmetric and antisymmetric modes, with two local peaks tacked to the HSs, and\nno additional peaks between them, may be stable. In this case, all the\nhigher-order multi-peak modes, being unstable, evolve into the fundamental\nones. Stability regions for the fundamental modes are reported. A more\ninteresting situation is found in the case of the self-defocusing cubic\nnonlinearity, with the HS pair giving rise to a multi-stability, with up to\neight coexisting stable multi-peak patterns, symmetric and antisymmetric ones.\nThe system without the self-interaction, the nonlinearity 2 being represented\nonly by the local cubic loss, is investigated too. This case is similar to\nthose with the self-focusing or defocusing nonlinearity, if the linear\npotential of the HS is, respectively, attractive or repulsive.

Our extended robust UCB eliminates this\nrequirement while still achieving the optimal regret growth order $O(\\log T)$,\nthus providing a broadened application area of the UCB policies for the\nheavy-tailed reward distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 05:53:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 06:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Recently, convex relaxation methods for image multi-labeling were\nproposed in the literature. Often these models involve the total variation (TV)\nsemi-norm as regularizing term. However, it is well-known that the TV\nfunctional is not optimal for the segmentation of textured regions. In recent\nyears directional representation systems were proposed to cope with curved\nsingularities in images. In particular, curvelets and shearlets provide an\noptimally sparse approximation in the class of piecewise smooth functions with\n$C^2$ singularity boundaries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the discrete\nshearlet transform is suited as regularizer for the segmentation of curved\nstructures. Neither the shearlet nor the curvelet transform where used as\nregularizer in a segmentation model so far. To this end, we have implemented a\ntranslation invariant finite discrete shearlet transform based on the FFT. We\ndescribe how the shearlet transform can be incorporated within the multi-label\nsegmentation model and show how to find a minimizer of the corresponding\nfunctional by applying an alternating direction method of multipliers. Here the\nParseval frame property of our shearlets comes into play.

We present analytical formulas for the spin accumulation and\nspin current profiles in those junctions that are valid for both tunnel and\ntransparent (as well as intermediate) contacts. For F/N junctions we calculate\nthe thermal spin injection efficiency and the spin accumulation induced\nnonequilibrium thermopower. We find conditions for countering thermal spin\neffects in the N region with electrical spin injection. This compensating\neffect should be particularly useful for distinguishing electronic from other\nmechanisms of spin injection by thermal gradients.

The main\nconclusions provide insight on the probability of a large busy period, and the\nmanner in which this occurs:\n  I) The scaled probability of a large busy period has the asymptote, for any\n$b>0$, \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\log P(B\\geq bn) = -K\\sqrt{b},\n\\hbox{where} \\quad K = 2 \\sqrt{-\\int_0^{\\lambda^*} \\Lambda(\\theta) d\\theta},\n\\quad \\hbox{with $\\lambda^*=\\sup\\{\\theta:\\Lambda(\\theta)\\leq0\\}$,} and with\n$\\Lambda$ denoting the scaled cumulant generating function of the increments\nprocess.\n  II) The most likely path to a large swept area is found to be a simple\nrescaling of the path on $[0,1]$ given by, [\\psi^*(t) =\n-\\Lambda(\\lambda^*(1-t))/\\lambda^*.] In contrast to the piecewise linear most\nlikely path leading the random walk to hit a high level, this is strictly\nconcave in general. While these two most likely paths have very different\nforms, their derivatives coincide at the start of their trajectories, and at\ntheir first return to zero.\n  These results partially answer an open problem of Kulick and Palmowski\nregarding the tail of the work done during a busy period at a single server\nqueue. The paper concludes with applications of these results to the estimation\nof the busy period statistics $(\\lambda^*, K)$ based on observations of the\nincrements, offering the possibility of estimating the likelihood of a large\nbusy period in advance of observing one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 12:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2012 14:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

A barrier to finding communities is that the solution\nconcept is often defined in terms of an NP-complete problem such as Clique or\nHierarchical Clustering.\n  This paper seeks to initiate a rigorous approach to the problem of finding\noverlapping communities, where \"rigorous\" means that we clearly state the\nfollowing: (a) the object sought by our algorithm (b) the assumptions about the\nunderlying network (c) the (worst-case) running time.\n  Our assumptions about the network lie between worst-case and average-case. An\naverage case analysis would require a precise probabilistic model of the\nnetwork, on which there is currently no consensus. However, some plausible\nassumptions about network parameters can be gleaned from a long body of work in\nthe sociology community spanning five decades focusing on the study of\nindividual communities and ego-centric networks. Thus our assumptions are\nsomewhat \"local\" in nature. Nevertheless they suffice to permit a rigorous\nanalysis of running time of algorithms that recover global structure.\n  Our algorithms use random sampling similar to that in property testing and\nalgorithms for dense graphs. However, our networks are not necessarily dense\ngraphs, not even in local neighborhoods.\n  Our algorithms explore a local-global relationship between ego-centric and\nsocio-centric networks that we hope will provide a fruitful framework for\nfuture work both in computer science and sociology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 13:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-09"}

No excess over the expected atmospheric\nneutrino background has been observed. We combine these results with the\npreviously published IceCube limits obtained with data taken during 2007 to\nobtain a total livetime of 1065 days. We provide an upper limit at 90%\nconfidence level on the annihilation rate of captured neutralinos in the Sun,\nas well as the corresponding muon flux limit at the Earth, both as functions of\nthe neutralino mass in the range 50 GeV-5000 GeV. We also derive a limit on the\nneutralino-proton spin-dependent and spin-independent cross section. The limits\npresented here improve the previous results obtained by the collaboration\nbetween a factor of two and five, as well as extending the neutralino masses\nprobed down to 50 GeV. The spin-dependent cross section limits are the most\nstringent so far for neutralino masses above 200 GeV, and well below direct\nsearch results in the mass range from 50 GeV to 5 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 14:10:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 10:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-29"}

We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the\nbinary star systems under the assumption of coplanarity of the disk, host star\nand binary companion. We use the grid-based, staggered mesh code FARGO with an\nadditional energy equation to which we added radiative cooling based on opacity\ntables.

The crux of the method is to use\npolynomial expansions of the backward characteristic flow to transport the\nnumerical particles with improved accuracy: in the first order case the method\nconsists of representing the transported density with linearly-transformed\nparticles, the second order version computes quadratically-transformed\nparticles, and so on. For programming purposes we provide explicit\nimplementations of the resulting LTP and QTP schemes that only involve\npointwise evaluations of the forward characteristic flow, and also come with\nlocal indicators for the accuracy of the corresponding transport scheme.\nNumerical tests using different transport problems demonstrate the accuracy of\nthe proposed methods compared to standard particle schemes, and establish their\nrobustness with respect to the remapping period. In particular, it is shown\nthat QTP particles can be transported without remappings on very long periods\nof times, without hampering the accuracy of the numerical solutions. Finally, a\ndynamic criterion is proposed to automatically select the time steps where the\nparticles should be remapped. The strategy does not require additional\ninter-particle communications, and it is validated by numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 15:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 22:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 12:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}
