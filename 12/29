Robber and the cops are placed\non the vertices of the graph; they take turns in moving to adjacent vertices\n(or staying), cops inside the guarded region, Robber on the remaining vertices\n(the robber-region). The goal of Robber is to enter the guarded region at a\nvertex with no cop on it. The problem is to determine whether for a given graph\nand given number of cops the cops are able to prevent Robber from entering the\nguarded region. Fomin et al. [Fomin, Golovach, Hall, Mihalak, Vicari, Widmayer:\nHow to Guard a Graph? Algorithmica 61(4), 839--856 (2011)] proved that the\nproblem is NP-complete when the robber-region is restricted to a tree. Further\nthey prove that is it PSPACE-complete when the robber-region is restricted to a\ndirected acyclic graph, and they ask about the problem complexity for arbitrary\ngraphs. In this paper we prove that the problem is E-complete for arbitrary\ndirected graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 16:03:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 12:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

To compensate for this effect the solid containing the\nqubit must oscillate in unison with the current. This requires entanglement of\nquantum states of the qubit with quantum states of a macroscopic body. The\nquestion then arises whether slow decoherence of quantum oscillations of the\ncurrent is consistent with fast decoherence of quantum states of a macroscopic\nsolid. This problem is analyzed within an exactly solvable quantum model of a\nqubit embedded in an absolutely rigid solid and for the elastic model that\nconserves the total angular momentum. We show that while the quantum state of a\nflux qubit is, in general, a mixture of a large number of rotational states,\nslow decoherence is permitted if the system is macroscopically large.

PETs do not affect scattering phase\nshifts and bound state energies of two-body system but are conventionally\nsupposed to modify two-body bound state observables such as the rms radius and\nelectromagnetic moments. Purpose: In order to preserve all bound state\nobservables, we propose a new particular case of PETs, a deuteron-equivalent\ntransformation (DET-PET), which leaves unchanged not only scattering phase\nshifts and bound state (deuteron) binding energy but also the bound state wave\nfunction. Methods: The construction of DET-PET is discussed; equations defining\nthe simplest DET-PETs are derived. We apply these simplest DET-PETs to the\nJISP16 $NN$ interaction and use the transformed $NN$ interactions in\ncalculations of $^3$H and $^4$He binding energies in the No-core Full\nConfiguration (NCFC) approach based on extrapolations of the No-core Shell\nModel (NCSM) basis space results to the infinite basis space. Results: We\ndemonstrate the DET-PET modification of the $np$ scattering wave functions and\nstudy the DET-PET manifestation in the binding energies of $^3$H and $^4$He\nnuclei and their correlation (Tjon line). Conclusions: It is shown that some\nDET-PETs generate modifications of the central component while the others\nmodify the tensor component of the $NN$ interaction. DET-PETs are able to\nmodify significantly the $np$ scattering wave functions and hence the off-shell\nproperties of the $NN$ interaction. DET-PETs give rise to significant changes\nin the binding energies of $^3$H (in the range of approximately 1.5 MeV) and\n$^4$He (in the range of more than 9 MeV) and are able to modify the correlation\npatterns of binding energies of these nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 17:12:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 11:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

This slow oscillation,\ninvolving many high-energy modes, dominates the response remarkably in the\nlimit of long observation time.

Moreover we prove that such universal constructions are\nalso possible in case of a non convergent rewriting system, outside the scope\nof Brylawski's work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 20:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-08"}

The majority of the literature focuses on deriving homogenized\nconstitutive responses for macroscopic composites relating effective properties\nto various microstructural details. Due to large surface to volume ratio,\nphenomena at the nanoscale require consideration of surface energy effects and\nthe latter are frequently used to interpret size-effects in material behavior.\nElucidation of the effect of surface roughness on the surface stress and\nelastic behavior is relatively under-studied and quite relevant to the behavior\nof nanostructures. In this work, we present derivations that relate both\nperiodic and random roughness to the effective surface elastic behavior. We\nfind that the residual surface stress is hardly affected by roughness while the\nsuperficial elasticity properties are dramatically altered and, importantly,\nmay also result in a change in its sign - this has ramifications in\ninterpretation of sensing based on frequency measurement changes due to surface\nelasticity. We show that the square of resonance frequency of a cantilever beam\nwith rough surface decreases as much as three times of its value for flat\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 21:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-30"}

We show that there\nare also distinct signatures in the photon-photon correlation function\n$g^{(2)}(t)$ in that regime, including oscillations decaying on a time scale\nnot only much longer than the optical cavity decay time, but even longer than\nthe \\emph{mechanical} decay time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 23:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 18:14:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 19:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}

As solar cycle is believed to be a result\nof the solar dynamo action, these relations require explanation in the\nframework of this theory.Here we aim to present a possible explanation of such\nkind. We relate the cycle-to-cycle variability of solar activity to\nfluctuations of solar dynamo drivers and primarily to fluctuations in the\nparameter responsible for recovery of the poloidal magnetic field from the\ntoroidal one. To be specific, we develop such a model in the framework of the\nmean-field dynamo based on the differential rotation and $\\alpha$-effect. We\ndemonstrate that the mean-field dynamo based on a realistic rotation curve and\nnonlinearity associated with the magnetic helicity balance reproduces both\nqualitatively and quantitatively the Waldmeier relations observed in sunspot\ndata since 1750 (SIDC data). The model also reproduces more or less\nsuccessfully other relations between the parameters under discussion, in\nparticular, the link between odd and even cycles (Gnevyshev-Ohl rule). We\nconclude that the contemporary solar dynamo theory provides a way to explain\nthe cycle-to-cycle variability of solar activity as recorded in sunspots. We\ndiscuss the importance of the model for stellar activity cycles which, as known\nfrom the data of HK project, demonstrate the cycle-to-cycle variability similar\nto solar cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 04:05:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 09:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-24"}

The\nnext challenge lies in semantically performing clustering based on the semantic\ncontents of the document. The problem of document clustering has two main\ncomponents: (1) to represent the document in such a form that inherently\ncaptures semantics of the text. This may also help to reduce dimensionality of\nthe document, and (2) to define a similarity measure based on the semantic\nrepresentation such that it assigns higher numerical values to document pairs\nwhich have higher semantic relationship. Feature space of the documents can be\nvery challenging for document clustering. A document may contain multiple\ntopics, it may contain a large set of class-independent general-words, and a\nhandful class-specific core-words. With these features in mind, traditional\nagglomerative clustering algorithms, which are based on either Document Vector\nmodel (DVM) or Suffix Tree model (STC), are less efficient in producing results\nwith high cluster quality. This paper introduces a new approach for document\nclustering based on the Topic Map representation of the documents. The document\nis being transformed into a compact form. A similarity measure is proposed\nbased upon the inferred information through topic maps data and structures. The\nsuggested method is implemented using agglomerative hierarchal clustering and\ntested on standard Information retrieval (IR) datasets. The comparative\nexperiment reveals that the proposed approach is effective in improving the\ncluster quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 04:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-30"}

Different methods\nfor quantifying the quantum and classical parts of correlations are amongst the\nmore actively-studied topics of quantum information theory over the past\ndecade. Entanglement is the most prominent of these correlations, but in many\ncases unentangled states exhibit nonclassical behavior too. Thus distinguishing\nquantum correlations other than entanglement provides a better division between\nthe quantum and classical worlds, especially when considering mixed states.\nHere we review different notions of classical and quantum correlations\nquantified by quantum discord and other related measures. In the first half, we\nreview the mathematical properties of the measures of quantum correlations,\nrelate them to each other, and discuss the classical-quantum division that is\ncommon among them. In the second half, we show that the measures identify and\nquantify the deviation from classicality in various\nquantum-information-processing tasks, quantum thermodynamics, open-system\ndynamics, and many-body physics. We show that in many cases quantum\ncorrelations indicate an advantage of quantum methods over classical ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 07:05:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 16:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 14:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-29"}

The new version of the\nMonte Carlo code (called MOCCA), in addition to the features of the old\nversion, incorporates the direct Fewbody integrator (Fregeau et al. 2004) for\nthree- and four-body interactions, and a new treatment of the escape process\nbased on Fukushige & Heggie (2000).

With the addition of the Fewbody integrator\nthe code can follow all interaction channels which are important for the rate\nof creation of various types of objects observed in star clusters, and ensures\nthat the energy generation by binaries is treated in a manner similar to the\n$N$-body model.\n  There are at most three new parameters which have to be adjusted against\n$N$-body simulations for large $N$: two (or one, depending on the chosen\napproach) connected with the escape process, and one responsible for the\ndetermination of the interaction probabilities. The values adopted for the free\nparameters have at most a weak dependence on $N$. They allow MOCCA to reproduce\n$N$-body results with reasonable precision, not only for the rate of cluster\nevolution and the cluster mass distribution, but also for the detailed\ndistributions of mass and binding energy of binaries.

We give an algorithm that\nschedules the transmissions using $O(c+\\log{n})$ wavelengths. We also show a\npattern for which $\\Omega(c+\\log{n}/\\log\\log{n})$ wavelengths are needed. In\nthe {\\em on-line} version, the transmissions arrive and depart dynamically, and\nmust be scheduled without upsetting the previously scheduled transmissions. For\nthis case we give an on-line algorithm which has competitive ratio\n$\\Theta(\\log{n})$. We show that this is optimal in the sense that every on-line\nalgorithm must have competitive ratio $\\Omega(\\log{n})$. We also give an\nalgorithm that appears to do well in simulation (for the classes of traffic we\nconsider), but which has competitive ratio between $\\Omega(\\log^2n/\\log\n\\log{n})$ and $O(\\log^2n)$.

An important\ncontribution in this context is given by modal logics for strategic ability, in\nthe setting of multi-agent games, such as ATL, ATL\\star, and the like.\nRecently, Chatterjee, Henzinger, and Piterman introduced Strategy Logic, which\nwe denote here by CHP-SL, with the aim of getting a powerful framework for\nreasoning explicitly about strategies. CHP-SL is obtained by using first-order\nquantifications over strategies and has been investigated in the very specific\nsetting of two-agents turned-based games, where a non-elementary model-checking\nalgorithm has been provided. While CHP-SL is a very expressive logic, we claim\nthat it does not fully capture the strategic aspects of multi-agent systems. In\nthis paper, we introduce and study a more general strategy logic, denoted SL,\nfor reasoning about strategies in multi-agent concurrent games. We prove that\nSL includes CHP-SL, while maintaining a decidable model-checking problem. In\nparticular, the algorithm we propose is computationally not harder than the\nbest one known for CHP-SL. Moreover, we prove that such a problem for SL is\nNonElementarySpace-hard. This negative result has spurred us to investigate\nhere syntactic fragments of SL, strictly subsuming ATL\\star, with the hope of\nobtaining an elementary model-checking problem. Among the others, we study the\nsublogics SL[NG], SL[BG], and SL[1G]. They encompass formulas in a special\nprenex normal form having, respectively, nested temporal goals, Boolean\ncombinations of goals and, a single goal at a time. About these logics, we\nprove that the model-checking problem for SL[1G] is 2ExpTime-complete, thus not\nharder than the one for ATL\\star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 11:12:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 00:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-13"}

Typically, the magnetic moment carried by an\nadsorbate can be changed by collision with a tunneling electron; in this\nprocess the spin of the electron can flip or not. A previous one-electron\ntheory [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 103}, 176601 (2009)] successfully explained both\nthe conductance thresholds and the magnitude of the conductance variation. The\nelastic spin flip of conduction electrons by a magnetic impurity leads to the\nwell known Kondo effect. In the present work, we compare the theoretical\npredictions for inelastic magnetic tunneling obtained with a one-electron\napproach and with a many-body theory including Kondo-like phenomena. We apply\nour theories to a singlet-triplet transition model system that contains most of\nthe characteristics revealed in magnetic IETS. We use two self-consistent\ntreatments (non-crossing approximation and self-consistent ladder\napproximation). We show that, although the one-electron limit is properly\nrecovered, new intrinsic many-body features appear. In particular, sharp peaks\nappear close to the inelastic thresholds; these are not localized exactly at\nthresholds and could influence the determination of magnetic structures from\nIETS experiments.Analysis of the evolution with temperature reveals that these\nmany-body features involve an energy scale different from that of the usual\nKondo peaks.

The new\napproach begins by identifying a set of order functions (e.g. stress length,\nshear-induced eddy length), in analogy with the order parameter in Landau's\nmean-field theory, which aims at capturing symmetry aspects of the fluctuations\n(e.g. Reynolds stress, dissipation). The order functions are assumed to satisfy\na dilation group invariance - representing the effects of the wall on\nfluctuations - which allows us to postulate three new kinds of invariant\nsolutions of the mean momentum equation (MME), focusing on group invariants of\nthe order functions (rather than those of the mean velocity as done in previous\nstudies). The first - a power law solution - gives functional forms for the\nviscous sublayer, the buffer layer, the log-layer, and a newly identified\ncentral `core' (for channel and pipe, but non-existent for TBL). The second - a\ndefect power law of form $1-r^{m}$ ($r$ being the distance from the center\nline) - describes the `bulk zone' (the region of balance between production and\ndissipation). The third - a relation between the group invariants of the stress\nlength function and its first derivative - describes scaling transition between\nadjacent layers. A combination of these three expressions yields a multi-layer\nformula covering the entire flow domain, identifying three important\nparameters: scaling exponent, layer thickness, and transition sharpness. All\nthree kinds of invariant solutions are validated, individually and in\ncombination, by data from direct numerical simulations (DNS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 14:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 09:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 08:38:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 09:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 9 May 2015 21:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

The statefinder diagnosis also indicates that the universe\nleaves an unstable state in the past, passes the LCDM state and finally\napproaches the sable state in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 06:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It involves three\ncoupled first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and has the\nsecond-order Painlev\\'e II equation at its core. Solutions are now grouped by\nB\\\"acklund transformations into infinite sequences, partially labelled by two\nB\\\"acklund invariants. Each sequence is characterized by evenly-spaced\nquantized fluxes of the two ionic species, and hence evenly-spaced quantization\nof the electric current-density. Finite subsequences of exact solutions are\nidentified, with positive ionic concentrations and quantized fluxes, starting\nfrom a solution with zero electric field found by Planck, and suggesting an\ninterpretation as a ground state plus excited states of the system. Positivity\nof ionic concentrations is established whenever Planck's charge-neutral\nboundary-conditions apply. Exact solutions are obtained for the electric field\nand ionic concentrations in well-stirred reservoirs outside each face of the\njunction, enabling the formulation of more realistic boundary-conditions. In an\napproximate form, these lead to radiation boundary conditions for Painlev\\'e\nII. Illustrative numerical solutions are presented, and the problem of\nestablishing compatibility of boundary conditions with the structure of\nflux-quantizing sequences is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 05:02:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 05:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This raises an important\nphysical question: What is responsible for making quantum correlations so much\nmore disciplined? Here we explain the observed discipline of quantum\ncorrelations by identifying the symmetries of our physical space with those of\na parallelized 7-sphere. We substantiate this identification by proving that\nany quantum correlation can be understood as a classical, local-realistic\ncorrelation among a set of points of a parallelized 7-sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 21:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 16:33:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 18:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 13:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-15"}
