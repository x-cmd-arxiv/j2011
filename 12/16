Despite its fundamental role, it is\ntypically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit\ndefinition. Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the\nwavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities via\nthe Born Rule. Presently, scientists determine the wavefunction through\ntomographic methods, which estimate the wavefunction that is most consistent\nwith a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods\ncompounds the problem of defining the wavefunction. Here we show that the\nwavefunction can be measured directly by the sequential measurement of two\ncomplementary variables of the system. The crux of our method is that the first\nmeasurement is performed in a gentle way (i.e. weak measurement) so as not to\ninvalidate the second. The result is that the real and imaginary components of\nthe wavefunction appear directly on our measurement apparatus. We give an\nexperimental example by directly measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction\nof a single photon, a task not previously realized by any method. We show that\nthe concept is universal, being applicable both to other degrees of freedom of\nthe photon (e.g. polarization, frequency, etc.) and to other quantum systems\n(e.g. electron spin-z quantum state, SQUIDs, trapped ions, etc.). Consequently,\nthis method gives the wavefunction a straightforward and general definition in\nterms of a specific set of experimental operations. We expect it to expand the\nrange of quantum systems scientists are able to characterize and initiate new\navenues to understand fundamental quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 17:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-16"}

This conclusion is based on the fact that the low energy\n6-14 MeV galactic electron intensity suddenly increased by ~20% over a time\nperiod \\leg 10 days and the electron radial intensity gradient abruptly\ndecreased from ~19%/AU to ~8%/AU at 2009.7 at a radial distance of 111.2 AU. A\nsudden radial gradient change was also observed at this time for >200 MeV\nprotons. The gradients were constant during the time period before and after\nthe electron increase. At about 2011.2 at a distance of 116.6 AU a second\nabrupt intensity increase was observed, this time for both electrons and\nprotons. The increase for electrons was ~25% and occurred over a time period\n~15 days or less. For >200 MeV protons the increase at this time was ~5%\n(unusually large) and occurred over a longer time period ~50 days. Between\nabout 2011.2 and 2011.6, radial intensity gradients ~18%/AU and 3%/AU were\nobserved for electrons and protons, respectively. These gradients were very\nsimilar to those observed for these particles before the 1st sudden increase at\n2009.7. These large positive gradients observed after 2011.2 indicate that V1,\nalthough it has entered a different propagation region, is still within the\noverall heliospheric modulating region at least up to a time ~2011.6 (118.0\nAU). In this paper we will discuss these events in more detail and consider\npossibilities for their explanation that have recently been suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 18:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The data is compared to predictions from three model calculations.\nDue to the large acceptance of the HADES apparatus for $e^{+}e^{-}$ invariant\nmasses above 0.2 GeV/$c^{2}$ and for transverse pair momenta p$_{t}$ $ <$ 1\nGeV/$c$, acceptance corrections are to a large extent model independent.

We find that during a merger, a shock propagates\noutward from the parent cluster, resulting in an overestimate in the\nhydrostatic mass bias. After the merger, as a cluster relaxes, the bias in\nhydrostatic mass estimate decreases but remains at a level of -5-10% with\n15-20% scatter within r500. We also investigate the post-merger evolution of\nthe pressure support from bulk motions, a dominant cause of this residual mass\nbias. At r500, the contribution from random motions peaks at 30% of the total\npressure during the merger and quickly decays to \\sim 10-15% as a cluster\nrelaxes. Additionally, we use a measure of the random motion pressure to\ncorrect the hydrostatic mass estimate. We discover that 4 Gyr after mergers,\nthe direct effects of the merger event on the hydrostatic mass bias have become\nnegligible. Thereafter, the mass bias is primarily due to residual bulk motions\nin the gas which are not accounted for in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation.\nWe present a hydrostatic mass bias correction method that can recover the\nunbiased cluster mass for relaxed clusters with 9% scatter at r500 and 11%\nscatter in the outskirts, within r200.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 21:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 18:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

By working\ndirectly with the motion equations, the paradox is shown here to be a\nconsequence of the rigid lid constraint coupling through incompressibility with\nthe infinite inertia of the far ends of the channel, assumed to be at rest in\nhydrostatic equilibrium. Accordingly, when inertia is removed by eliminating\nthe stratification, or, remarkably, by using the Boussinesq approximation of\nuniform density for the inertia terms, horizontal momentum conservation is\nrecovered. This interplay between constraints,action at a distance by\nincompressibility, and inertia is illustrated by layer-averaged exact results,\ntwo-layer long-wave models, and direct numerical simulations of the\nincompressible Euler equations with smooth stratification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 21:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 02:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 05:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-29"}

We investigate different distributions of\nenergy input in time and space to investigate which process is most relevant\nfor understanding these coronal condensations. For a comparison to observations\nwe synthesize EUV emission from a time-dependent, one-dimensional model for\ncoronal loops, where we employ two heating scenarios: simply shutting down the\nheating and a model where the heating is very concentrated at the loop\nfootpoints, while keeping the total heat input constant. The heating off/on\nmodel does not lead to significant EUV count rates that one observes with\nSDO/AIA. In contrast, the concentration of the heating near the footpoints\nleads to thermal non-equilibrium near the loop top resulting in the well-known\ncatastrophic cooling. This process gives a good match to observations of\ncoronal condensations. This shows that the corona needs a steady supply of\nenergy to support the coronal plasma, even during coronal condensations.\nOtherwise the corona would drain very fast, too fast to even form a\ncondensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 21:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-06"}

Tuning the parameters \\alpha_i\nallows smooth interpolation between purely selfish and purely altruistic\nbehavior. Within this framework, we study altruistic extensions of linear\ncongestion games, fair cost-sharing games and valid utility games.\n  We derive (tight) bounds on the price of anarchy of these games for several\nsolution concepts. Thereto, we suitably adapt the smoothness notion introduced\nby Roughgarden and show that it captures the essential properties to determine\nthe robust price of anarchy of these games. Our bounds show that for congestion\ngames and cost-sharing games, the worst-case robust price of anarchy increases\nwith increasing altruism, while for valid utility games, it remains constant\nand is not affected by altruism. However, the increase in the price of anarchy\nis not a universal phenomenon: for symmetric singleton linear congestion games,\nwe derive a bound on the pure price of anarchy that decreases as the level of\naltruism increases. Since the bound is also strictly lower than the robust\nprice of anarchy, it exhibits a natural example in which Nash equilibria are\nmore efficient than more permissive notions of equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 21:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 08:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-21"}

Experiments\nalso show that the transition temperature varies with sample size, L, according\nto T_s ~ 1/L. These experiments pose a potential challenge to the holographic\nAdS/QHE model recently proposed in arXiv:1008.1917. This proposal, which was\nmotivated by the natural way AdS/CFT methods capture the emergent duality\nsymmetries exhibited by quantum Hall systems, successfully describes the\nscaling exponent p by relating it to an infrared dynamical exponent z with p =\n2/z. For a broad class of models z is robustly shown to be z = 5 in the regime\nrelevant to the experiments (though becoming z = 1 further in the ultraviolet).\nBy incorporating finite-size effects into these models we show that they\nreproduce a transition to a temperature-independent regime, predicting a\ntransition temperature satisfying T_s ~ 1/L or ~ 1/L^5 in two separate regions\nof parameter space, even though z = 5 governs the temperature dependence of the\nconductivity in both cases. The possibility of a deviation from naive z = 5\nscaling arises because the brane tension introduces a new scale, which alters\nwhere the transition between UV and IR scaling occurs, in an L-dependent way.\nThe AdS/CFT calculation indicates the two regimes of temperature scaling are\nseparated by a first-order transition, suggesting new possibilities for testing\nthe picture experimentally. Remarkably, in this interpretation the gravity dual\nof the transition from temperature scaling to temperature-independent\nresistance is related to the Chandrashekar transition from a star to a black\nhole with increasing mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 01:13:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 03:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-05"}

We find that\nmassive and compact stellar clumps with masses larger than 10^6 M_sun, which\ncan be regarded as progenitors of MGCs, can form from massive gas clumps that\nare developed through merging of gaseous regions initially at different regions\nand thus with different metallicities. Therefore it is inevitable that MGCs\nformed in dwarfs have HEAS. The abundance spread in each individual MGC depends\non the radial metallicity gradient of the host dwarf such that it can be larger\nfor the steeper metallicity gradient. For example, MGCs formed in a dwarf with\na central metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.1 and the radial gradient of -0.2 dex\nkpc^{-1} can have the abundance spread of Delta [Fe/H] ~.2. The simulated MGCs\nappear to be significantly flattened owing to their dissipative formation from\ngas disks of their host dwarfs.

H II regions are described by several physical parameters such as\nelectron density, electron temperature, and reddening, in addition to y, the\nratio of helium to hydrogen. It had been customary to estimate or determine\nself-consistently these parameters to calculate y. Frequentist analyses of the\nparameter space have been shown to be successful in these determinations, and\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques have proven to be very efficient in\nsampling this parameter space. Nevertheless, accurate determination of the\nprimordial helium abundance from observations of H II regions is constrained by\nboth systematic and statistical uncertainties. In an attempt to better reduce\nthe latter, and better characterize the former, we apply MCMC methods to the\nlarge dataset recently compiled by Izotov, Thuan, & Stasinska (2007). To\nimprove the reliability of the determination, a high quality dataset is needed.\nIn pursuit of this, a variety of cuts are explored.

One of the most studied ensembles are real symmetric matrices\nwith independent entries iidrv; the limiting rescaled spectral measure (LRSM)\n$\\widetilde{\\mu}$ is the semi-circle. Studies have determined the LRSMs for\nmany structured ensembles, such as Toeplitz and circulant matrices. These have\nvery different behavior; the LRSM for both have unbounded support. Given a\nstructured ensemble such that (i) each random variable occurs o(N) times in\neach row and (ii) the LRSM exists, we introduce a parameter to continuously\ninterpolate between these behaviors. We fix a p in [1/2, 1] and study the\nensemble of signed structured matrices by multiplying the (i,j)-th and (j,i)-th\nentries of a matrix by a randomly chosen epsilon_ij in {1, -1}, with\nProb(epsilon_ij = 1) = p (i.e., the Hadamard product).

The\nspectra were fitted with polynomial baselines to derive the absorption spectra.\nThe molecular absorption bands were then fitted with the laboratory database of\nice absorption bands, considering the instrumental line profile and the\nspectral resolution of the grism dispersion element. Towards the class 0-I\nsources (L1527, IRC-L1041-2, and IRAS04302), absorption bands of H$_2$O,\nCO$_2$, CO, and XCN are clearly detected. Column density ratios of CO$_2$ ice\nand CO ice relative to H$_2$O ice are 21-28% and 13-46%, respectively. If XCN\nis OCN$^-$, its column density is as high as 2-6% relative to H$_2$O ice. The\nHDO ice feature at 4.1 $\\mu$m is tentatively detected towards the class 0-I\nsources and HV Tau. Non-detections of the CH-stretching mode features around\n3.5 $\\mu$m provide upper limits to the CH$_3$OH abundance of 26% (L1527) and\n42% (IRAS04302) relative to H$_2$O. We tentatively detect OCS ice absorption\ntowards IRC-L1041-2. Towards class 0-I sources, the detected features should\nmostly originate in the cold envelope, while CO gas and OCN$^-$ could originate\nin the region close to the protostar, where there are warm temperatures and UV\nradiation. We detect H$_2$O ice band towards ASR41 and 2MASSJ1628137-243139,\nwhich are edge-on class II disks. We also detect H$_2$O ice and CO$_2$ ice\ntowards HV Tau, HK Tau, and UY Aur, and tentatively detect CO gas features\ntowards HK Tau and UY Aur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 08:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

Although providers have\nalready begun to implement and deploy tiered pricing contracts, little is known\nabout how such pricing affects ISPs and their customers. While contracts that\nsell connectivity on finer granularities improve market efficiency, they are\nalso more costly for ISPs to implement and more difficult for customers to\nunderstand. In this work we present two contributions: (1) we develop a novel\nway of mapping traffic and topology data to a demand and cost model; and (2) we\nfit this model on three large real-world networks: an European transit ISP, a\ncontent distribution network, and an academic research network, and run\ncounterfactuals to evaluate the effects of different pricing strategies on both\nthe ISP profit and the consumer surplus. We highlight three core findings.\nFirst, ISPs gain most of the profits with only three or four pricing tiers and\nlikely have little incentive to increase granularity of pricing even further.\nSecond, we show that consumer surplus follows closely, if not precisely, the\nincreases in ISP profit with more pricing tiers. Finally, the common ISP\npractice of structuring tiered contracts according to the cost of carrying the\ntraffic flows (e.g., offering a discount for traffic that is local) can be\nsuboptimal and that dividing contracts based on both traffic demand and the\ncost of carrying it into only three or four tiers yields near-optimal profit\nfor the ISP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 08:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

For a pair of memory references at a program point, a typical\npointer analysis specifies if the points-to relation between them may exist,\ndefinitely does not exist, or definitely exists. The \"may be\" case, which\ndescribes the points-to relation for most of the pairs, cannot be dealt with by\nmost compiler optimizations. This is so to guarantee the soundness of these\noptimizations. However, the \"may be\" case can be capitalized by the modern\nclass of speculative optimizations if the probability that two memory\nreferences alias can be measured. Focusing on multithreading, a prevailing\ntechnique of programming, this paper presents a new flow-sensitive technique\nfor probabilistic pointer analysis of multithreaded programs. The proposed\ntechnique has the form of a type system and calculates the probability of every\npoints-to relation at each program point. The key to our approach is to\ncalculate the points-to information via a post-type derivation. The use of type\nsystems has the advantage of associating each analysis results with a\njustification (proof) for the correctness of the results. This justification\nhas the form of a type derivation and is very much required in applications\nlike certified code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 10:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

In all cases, one type of\nmobile counter-ions only is present, and ensures electroneutrality (salt free\ncase). The method is based on a systematic expansion around the ground state\nformed by the two-dimensional Wigner crystal(s) of counter-ions at the\nplate(s). The leading SC order stems from a single-particle theory, and\ncoincides with the virial SC approach that has been much studied in the last 10\nyears. The first correction has the functional form of the virial SC\nprediction, but the prefactor is different. The present theory is free of\ndivergences and the obtained results, both for symmetrically and asymmetrically\ncharged plates, are in excellent agreement with available data of Monte-Carlo\nsimulations under strong and intermediate Coulombic couplings. All results\nobtained represent relevant improvements over the virial SC estimates.

In\ncontrast to its intensive use in practise, theoretical footing is still limited\nand only little work has been done yet to put MapReduce on a par with the major\ncomputational models. Following pioneer work that relates the MapReduce\nframework with PRAM and BSP in their macroscopic structure, we focus on the\nfunctionality provided by the framework itself, considered in the parallel\nexternal memory model (PEM). In this, we present upper and lower bounds on the\nparallel I/O-complexity that are matching up to constant factors for the\nshuffle step. The shuffle step is the single communication phase where all\ninformation of one MapReduce invocation gets transferred from map workers to\nreduce workers. Hence, we move the focus towards the internal communication\nstep in contrast to previous work. The results we obtain further carry over to\nthe BSP* model. On the one hand, this shows how much complexity can be \"hidden\"\nfor an algorithm expressed in MapReduce compared to PEM. On the other hand, our\nresults bound the worst-case performance loss of the MapReduce approach in\nterms of I/O-efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 11:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

In fact,\nwe can derive a one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that describes the\nevolution of the solution along the so-called slow manifold. This permits to\nhave a direct efficient determination of the equilibrium state and its\neffective potential, and thus to investigate its dependencies with respect to\nvarious parameters of the model. It also allows to obtain information about the\ntime escaping behavior. The results obtained for the reduced 1D equation are\nvalidated with those of the original 2D equation both for equilibrium and\ntransient behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 12:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-19"}

Aims: We determine if non-ideal MHD, including\nthe effects of ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation determined from a\ndetailed chemical network model, allows for disk formation at the earliest\nstages of star formation (SF). Methods: We employ the axisymmetric thin-disk\napproximation in order to resolve a dynamic range of 9 orders of magnitude in\nlength and 16 in density, while also calculating partial ionization using up to\n19 species in a detailed chemical equilibrium model. MB is applied using a\nsteady-state approximation, and a barotropic relation is used to capture the\nthermal evolution. Results: We resolve the formation of the first and second\ncores, with expansion waves at the periphery of each, a magnetic diffusion\nshock, and prestellar infall profiles at larger radii. Power-law profiles in\neach region can be understood analytically. After the formation of the second\ncore, centrifugal support rises rapidly and a low-mass disk of radius ~10 R_Sun\nis formed, when the second core has mass ~0.001 M_Sun. The mass-to-flux ratio\nis ~10,000 times the critical value in the central region. Conclusions: A small\ncentrifugal disk can form in the earliest stage of SF, due to a shut-off of MB\ncaused by magnetic field dissipation in the first core region. There is enough\nangular momentum loss to allow the second collapse to occur directly, and a\nlow-mass stellar core to form with a surrounding disk. The disk mass and size\nwill depend upon how the angular momentum transport mechanisms within the disk\ncan keep up with mass infall onto the disk. We estimate that the disk will\nremain <~10 AU, undetectable even by ALMA, in the early Class 0 phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2011 13:08:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Mar 2012 08:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-19"}

Only recently, it has\nbeen possible to simulate supernova explosions up to ~10 seconds, based on\nthree-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. These simulations show that the\nneutrino luminosities and spectra of all flavors are very similar and their\ndifference even decreases during the deleptonization of the proto-neutron star.\nAs a consequence, the ejecta are always proton rich which rules out the\npossible production of heavy r-process elements (Z>56).

The latter are dominated by ve\nabsorption on neutrons and anti-ve absorption on protons. At early times,\ncharge-current processes are responsible for spectral differences between.\nHowever, as the region of neutrino decoupling moves to higher densities during\ndeleptonization, charge-current reactions are suppressed by final state\nPauli-blocking. anti-ve absorption on protons is suppressed due to the\ncontinuously increasing chemical potential of the neutrons. ve absorption on\nneutrons is blocked by the increasing degeneracy of the electrons. These\neffects result in negligible contributions from charge-current reactions on\ntimescales on the order of tens of seconds, depending on the progenitor star.\nHence, the neutrino spectra are mainly determined from neutral-current\nprocesses which do not distinguish between the different flavors and results in\nthe convergence of the spectra.

The protocol to be used for such a pairwise key establishment is a key\nfactor determining the energy to be consumed by each sensor node during the\nsecure network configuration. On the other hand, to achieve the optimum network\nconfiguration, nodes may not need to establish pairwise keys with all of their\nneighbors. Because, links to be established are defined by the network\nconfiguration protocol and as long as the network connectivity requirements are\nsatisfied, number of links to be secured can be limited accordingly. In this\nsense, key establishment and network configuration performances are related to\neach other and this cross relation should be taken into consideration while\nimplementing security for WSN.

This method has been applied to several published coronal electron\ndensity models. The calculated temperature distributions reach a maximum at r >\n1.3 RS, and therefore do not satisfy one of the conditions for applying the shm\nmethod. Another method is the hydrostatic equilibrium method (hst), which\nenables coronal temperature distributions to be determined, providing solutions\nto the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. The temperature maximas using the hst\nmethod are almost equal to those obtained using the shm method, but the\ntemperature peak is always at significantly lower altitude when the hst-method\nis used than when the shm-method is used. A third and more recently developed\nmethod, dyn, can be used for the same published electron density profiles. The\ntemperature distributions obtained using the dyn method are regular solutions\nof the hydrodynamic equations. They depend on the expansion velocity of the\ncoronal plasma considered as a free input parameter in the calculations. At the\nbase of the solar corona, where the coronal bulk velocity is small (subsonic),\nthe dyn and hst methods give similar temperature values. Larger differences are\nfound at higher altitudes where the expansion velocity approaches and exceeds\nthe velocity of sound. This paper shows also the effects of the flow tube\ngeometry and ion temperatures on the electron temperature distributions. The\ndyn method is a generalization of the hst method, where the electron\ntemperature distribution tends to zero at infinite radial distances.
