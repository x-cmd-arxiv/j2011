We show that in the linear regime, the evolution of the laser pulse\nlength is affected by the frequency chirp, and that positive (negative) chirp\ncompresses (stretches) the laser pulse, thereby increasing (decreasing) the\npeak vector potential and wakefield amplitude. In the blowout regime, the\nfrequency chirp can be used to fine tune the localized etching rates at the\nfront of the laser. In our simulations, chirped laser pulses can lead to 15%\nhigher self-trapped electrons, and 10% higher peak energies as compare to the\ntransform-limited pulse. Chirps may be used to control the phase velocity of\nthe wake, and to relax the self-guiding conditions at the front of the laser.\nOur predictions are confirmed by multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations\nwith OSIRIS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 16:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We run cosmological zoom simulations\nfocusing on 3 halos spanning two orders of magnitude in mass, roughly from\n10^11 to 10^13 solar masses. We use a version of the Ramses code that includes\nradiative transfer of UV photons, and we employ a refinement strategy that\nallows us to resolve accretion streams in their natural environment to an\nunprecedented level. For the first time, we self-consistently model\nself-shielding in the cold streams from the cosmological UV background, which\nenables us to predict their temperatures, ionization states and Lya\nluminosities with improved accuracy. We find the efficiency of gravitational\nheating in cold streams in a ~10^11 solar mass halo is around 10-20% throughout\nmost of the halo but reaching much higher values close to the center. As a\nresult most of the Lya luminosity comes from gas which is concentrated at the\ncentral 20% of the halo radius, leading to Lya emission which is not extended.\nIn more massive halos, of >10^12 solar masses, cold accretion is complex and\ndisrupted, and gravitational heating does not happen as a steady process.\nIgnoring the factors of Lya scattering, local UV enhancement, and SNe feedback,\ncold accretion alone in these massive halos can produce LABs that largely agree\nwith observations in terms of morphology, extent, and luminosity. Our\nsimulations slightly and systematically over-predict LAB abundances, perhaps\nhinting that the interplay of these ignored factors may have a negative net\neffect on extent and luminosity. We predict that a factor of a few increase in\nsensitivity from current observational limits should unambiguously reveal\ncontinuum-free accretion streams around massive galaxies at z=3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 17:08:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 16:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The lower luminosities at low redshifts can\nbe understood as the external manifestation of either a lower Eddington ratio\nor a lower mass. To distinguish between both effects, we determine the possible\ndependence of masses and Eddington ratios of QSOs with a fixed luminosity as a\nfunction of redshifts; this avoids the Malmquist bias or any other selection\neffect. For the masses and Eddington ratios derived for a sample of QSOs in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey, we model their evolution by a double linear fit\nseparating the dependence on redshifts and luminosities. The validity of the\nfits and possible systematic effects were tested by the use of different\nestimators of masses or bolometric luminosities, and possible intergalactic\nextinction effects. The results do not show any significant evolution of black\nhole masses or Eddington ratios for equal luminosity QSOs.

In\n1978, an analysis of communication in asynchronous systems was suggested by\nLeslie Lamport. Lamport's analysis determines a notion of temporal precedence,\na sort of weak notion of time, which is otherwise missing in asynchronous\nsystems. This notion has been extensively utilized in various applications.\n  Yet the analysis is limited to systems that are asynchronous. In this thesis\nwe go beyond by investigating causality in synchronous systems. In such\nsystems, the boundaries of causal influence are not charted out exclusively by\nmessage passing. Here time itself, passing at a uniform (or almost uniform)\nrate for all processes, is also a medium by which causal influence may fan out.\nThis thesis studies, and characterizes, the combinations of time and message\npassing that govern causal influence in synchronous systems.\n  It turns out that knowledge based analysis [FHMV] provides a well tailored\nformal framework within which causal notions can be studied. As we show, the\nformal notion of knowledge is highly appropriate for characterizing causal\ninfluence in terms of information flow, broadening the analysis of Chandy and\nMisra in [ChM].\n  We define several generic classes of coordination problems that pose various\ntemporal ordering requirements on the participating processes. These\ncoordination problems provide natural generalizations of real life\nrequirements. We then analyze the causal conditions that underlie suitable\nsolutions to these problems. The analysis is conducted in two stages: first,\nthe temporal ordering requirements are reduced to epistemic conditions. Then,\nthese epistemic conditions are characterized in terms of the causal\ncommunication patterns that are necessary and sufficient to bring them about.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 18:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

Robust\ncluster mass determinations are a key ingredient for a reliable measurement of\nthis evolution, especially at high redshift. Weak gravitational lensing is a\npromising tool for, on average, unbiased mass estimates. This weak lensing\nproject aims at measuring reliable weak lensing masses for a complete X-ray\nselected sample of 36 high redshift (0.35<z<0.9) clusters. The goal of this\npaper is to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology against commonly\nencountered problems, including pure instrumental effects, the presence of\nbright (8--9 mag) stars close to the cluster centre, ground based measurements\nof high-z (z~0.8) clusters, and the presence of massive unrelated structures\nalong the line-sight. We select a subsample of seven clusters observed with\nMMT/Megacam. Instrumental effects are checked in detail by cross-comparison\nwith an archival CFHT/MegaCam observation. We derive mass estimates for seven\nclusters by modelling the tangential shear with an NFW profile, in two cases\nwith multiple components to account for projected structures in the\nline-of-sight. We firmly detect lensing signals from all seven clusters at more\nthan $3.5\\sigma$ and determine their masses, ranging from $10^{14} M_{\\odot}$\nto $10^{15} M_{\\odot}$, despite the presence of nearby bright stars.

High energy electrons accelerated during solar flare are abundant in\nthe solar corona and in the interplanetary space. Commonly, the number and the\nenergy of non-thermal electrons at the Sun is estimated using hard X-ray (HXR)\nspectral observations (e.g. RHESSI) and a single-particle collisional\napproximation. Aims. To investigate the role of the spectrally evolving\nLangmuir turbulence on the population of energetic electrons in the solar\ncorona. Methods. We numerically simulate the relaxation of a power-law\nnon-thermal electron population in a collisional inhomogeneous plasma including\nwave-particle, and wave-wave interactions. Results. The numerical simulations\nshow that the long-time evolution of electron population above 20 keV deviates\nsubstantially from the collisional approximation when wave-particle\ninteractions in non-uniform plasma are taken into account. The evolution of\nLangmuir wave spectrum towards smaller wavenumbers, due to large-scale density\nfluctuations and wave-wave interactions, leads to an effective acceleration of\nelectrons. Furthermore, the time-integrated spectrum of non-thermal electrons,\nwhich is normally observed with HXR above 20 keV, is noticeably increased due\nto acceleration of non-thermal electrons by Langmuir waves. Conclusions. The\nresults show that the observed HXR spectrum, when interpreted in terms of\ncollisional relaxation, can lead to an overestimated number and energy of\nenergetic electrons accelerated in the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 19:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Compared to\ngeneral (non-mutual) insurance models, which involve one-sided impulse control\n(i.e., either downside or upside impulse) of the underlying insurance reserve\nprocess that is required to be positive, a mutual insurance differs in allowing\ntwo-sided impulse control (i.e., both downside and upside impulse), coupled\nwith the classical proportional control of reinsurance. We prove that a special\nband-type impulse control $(a,A,B,b)$ with $a=0$ and $a<A<B<b$, coupled with a\nproportional reinsurance policy (classical control), is optimal when the\nobjective is to minimize the total maintenance cost. That is, when the reserve\nposition reaches a lower boundary of $a=0$, the reserve should immediately be\nraised to level $A$; when the reserve reaches an upper boundary of $b$, it\nshould immediately be reduced to a level $B$. An interesting finding produced\nby the study reported in this paper is that there exists a situation such that\nif the upside fixed cost is relatively large in comparison to a finite\nthreshold, then the optimal band control is reduced to a downside only (i.e.,\ndividend payment only) control in the form of $(0,0;B,b)$ with $a=A=0$. In this\ncase, it is optimal for the mutual insurance firm to go bankrupt as soon as its\nreserve level reaches zero, rather than to jump restart by calling for\nadditional contingent funds. This finding partially explains why many mutual\ninsurance companies, that were once quite popular in the financial markets, are\neither disappeared or converted to non-mutual ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 20:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

To facilitate a better\nunderstanding of ankylography, we posted the source codes of the ankylographic\nreconstruction on a public website and encouraged interested readers to\ndownload the codes and test the method [4]. Those who have tested our codes\nconfirm that the principle of ankylography works. Furthermore, our mathematical\nanalysis and numerical simulations suggest that, for a continuous object with\narray size of 14x14x14 voxels, its 3D structure can usually be reconstructed\nfrom the diffraction intensities sampled on a spherical shell of 1 voxel thick\n[4]. In some cases where the object does not have very dense structure,\nankylography can be applied to reconstruct its 3D image with array size of\n25x25x25 voxels [4]. What remains to be elucidated is how to extend\nankylography to the reconstruction of larger objects, and what further\ntheoretical, experimental and algorithm developments will be necessary to make\nankylography a practical and useful imaging tool. Here we present our\nup-to-date understanding of the potential and challenge of ankylography.\nFurther, we clarify some misconceptions on ankylography, and respond to\ntechnical comments raised by Wei [5] and Wang et al. [6] Finally, it is\nworthwhile to point out that the potential for recovering 3D information from\nthe Fourier coefficients within a spherical shell may also find application in\nother fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 20:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2011 05:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-30"}

We specifically consider relations between the star\nformation rates and measurements of dense, as well as total, molecular gas\nmasses. We argue that there is a fundamental empirical scaling relation that\ndirectly connects the local star formation process with that operating globally\nwithin galaxies. Specifically, the total star formation rate in a molecular\ncloud or galaxy is linearly proportional to the mass of dense gas within the\ncloud or galaxy. This simple relation, first documented in previous studies,\nholds over a span of mass covering nearly nine orders of magnitude and\nindicates that the rate of star formation is directly controlled by the amount\nof dense molecular gas that can be assembled within a star formation complex.\nWe further show that the star formation rates and total molecular masses,\ncharacterizing both local clouds and galaxies, are correlated over similarly\nlarge scales of mass and can be described by a family of linear star formation\nscaling laws, parameterized by $f_{DG}$, the fraction of dense gas contained\nwithin the clouds or galaxies. That is, the underlying star formation scaling\nlaw is always linear for clouds and galaxies with the same dense gas fraction.\nThese considerations provide a single unified framework for understanding the\nrelation between the standard (non-linear) extragalactic Schmidt-Kennicutt\nscaling law, that is typically derived from CO observations of the gas, and the\nlinear star formation scaling law derived from HCN observations of the dense\ngas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 20:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We propose a\ndefinition for the specific frequency of UCDs,\nS_{N,UCD}=N_{UCD}*10^{0.4*(M_{V,host}-M_{V,0})}*c_{w}. The parameter M_{V,0} is\nthe zeropoint of the definition, chosen such that the specific frequency of\nUCDs is the same as those of globular clusters, S_{N,GC}, if UCDs follow a\nsimple extrapolation of the GCLF. The parameter c_{w} is a correction term for\nthe GCLF width sigma.

In this case, we find that\nin this model i) the results for S_{psi phi} and B -> X_s gamma turn out to be\nSM-like, ii) the exclusive determination of |Vub| is favoured and most\nimportantly iii) the values of Delta M_{B_d} and Delta M_{B_s} being strongly\ncorrelated in this model with epsilon_K turn out to be much larger than the\ndata for the central values of input parameters: Delta M_{B_d}~0.75/ps and\nDelta M_{B_s}~27/ps. Therefore, from the present perspective, the model suffers\nfrom a serious epsilon_K-Delta M_{B_{d,s}} tension. However, this tension can\nbe softened considering theoretical and parametric uncertainties and in\nparticular the decrease of the weak decay constants. On the other side, the\nmodel can be strongly constrained considering the theoretically cleaner ratios\nDelta M_{B_d}/Delta M_{B_s} and BR(B^+ -> tau^+ nu)/Delta M_{B_d} and we find\nthat it is unable to remove simultaneously all the SM tensions on the data.\nFinally, we compare the pattern of flavour violation in MGF with selected\nextensions of the SM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2012 15:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Decays into\ncollider-invisible particles are particularly interesting as they are\ntheoretically well motivated and relatively clean experimentally. In this work\nwe estimate the potential of the 7 and 8 TeV LHC to observe an invisible Higgs\nbranching fraction. We analyze three channels that can be used to directly\nstudy the invisible Higgs branching ratio at the 7 TeV LHC: an invisible Higgs\nproduced in association with (i) a hard jet; (ii) a leptonic Z; and (iii)\nforward tagging jets. We find that the last channel, where the Higgs is\nproduced via weak boson fusion, is the most sensitive, allowing branching\nfractions as small as 40% to be probed at 20 inverse fb for masses in the range\nbetween 120 and 170 GeV, including in particular the interesting region around\n125 GeV.

During this span each system exhibited ~64-65\noutbursts, including six superoutbursts. We find that, in both systems, the\nnormal outbursts between two superoutbursts increase in duration over time by a\nfactor ~1.2-1.9, and then reset to a small value after the following\nsuperoutburst. In both systems the trend of quiescent intervals between normal\noutbursts is to increase to a local maximum about half way through the\nsupercycle - the interval from one superoutburst to the next - and then to\ndecrease back to a small value by the time of the next superoutburst. This is\ninconsistent with Osaki's thermal-tidal model, which predicts a monotonic\nincrease in the quiescent intervals between normal outbursts during a\nsupercycle. Also, most of the normal outbursts have an asymmetric,\nfast-rise/slower-decline shape, consistent with outbursts triggered at large\nradii. The exponential rate of decay of the plateau phase of the superoutbursts\nis 8 d/mag for V1504 Cyg and 12 d/mag for V344 Lyr. This time scale gives a\ndirect measure of the viscous time scale in the outer accretion disk given the\nexpectation that the entire disk is in the hot, viscous state during\nsuperoutburst. The resulting constraint on the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter,\nalpha_{hot} ~ 0.1, is consistent with the value inferred from the fast dwarf\nnova decays. By looking at the slow decay rate for superoutbursts, which occur\nin systems below the period gap, in combination with the slow decay rate in one\nlong outburst above the period gap (in U Gem), we infer a steep dependence of\nthe decay rate on orbital period for long outbursts. This implies a steep\ndependence of alpha_{cold} on orbital period, consistent with tidal torquing as\nbeing the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism in quiescent disks in\ninteracting binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 21:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We\nfind a stellar effective temperature Teff=5455+-100K, a metallicity of\n[Fe/H]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. Combined with an\nestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce a\nstellar mass of Mstar=0.912+-0.034 Msun and a stellar radius of\nRstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} Rsun. For three of the transit signals, our\nresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysical\nfalse positives. We conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely than\nthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (Kepler-20b), 1e5\n(Kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (Kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects as\nplanetary companions.

During 2008, flaring activity on a\ntimescale of a few days was observed with a peak flux of (0.70 +- 0.16) X\n10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1} at energies above 350GeV. In 2010 April, VERITAS\ndetected a flare from M87 with peak flux of (2.71 +- 0.68) X 10^{-11} cm^{-2}\ns^{-1} for E>350GeV. The source was observed for six consecutive nights during\nthe flare, resulting in a total of 21 hr of good quality data. The most rapid\nflux variation occurred on the trailing edge of the flare with an exponential\nflux decay time of 0.90^{+0.22}_{-0.15} days. The shortest detected exponential\nrise time is three times as long, at 2.87^{+1.65}_{-0.99} days. The quality of\nthe data sample is such that spectral analysis can be performed for three\nperiods: rising flux, peak flux, and falling flux. The spectra obtained are\nconsistent with power-law forms. The spectral index at the peak of the flare is\nequal to 2.19 +- 0.07. There is some indication that the spectrum is softer in\nthe falling phase of the flare than the peak phase, with a confidence level\ncorresponding to 3.6 standard deviations.

The wave and the CME on\n2011 June 7 were well observed by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard Solar\nDynamic Observatory. Following the solar eruption onset, marked by the\nbeginning of the rapid increasing of the CME velocity and the X-ray flux of\naccompanying flare, the CME exhibits a strong lateral expansion. During this\nimpulsive expansion phase, the expansion speed of the CME bubble increases from\n100 km s$^{-1}$ to 450 km s$^{-1}$ in only six minutes. An important finding is\nthat a diffuse wave front starts to separate from the front of the expanding\nbubble shortly after the lateral expansion slows down. Also a type-II burst is\nformed near the time of the separation. After the separation, two distinct\nfronts propagate with different kinematic properties. The diffuse front travels\nacross the entire solar disk; while the sharp front rises up, forming the CME\nejecta with the diffuse front ahead of it. These observations suggest that the\npreviously termed EUV wave is a composite phenomenon and driven by the CME\nexpansion. While the CME expansion is accelerating, the wave front is cospatial\nwith the CME front, thus the two fronts are indiscernible. Following the end of\nthe acceleration phase, the wave moves away from the CME front with gradually\nan increasing distance between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 01:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

That is, there are few differences between the elements of the\ncollection. This fact makes the compressibility of the collection extremely\nhigh. For example, a collection with all different versions of a Wikipedia\narticle can be compressed up to the 0.1% of its original space, using the\nLempel-Ziv 1977 (LZ77) compression scheme.\n  Many of these repetitive collections handle huge amounts of text data. For\nthat reason, we require a method to store them efficiently, while providing the\nability to operate on them. The most common operations are the extraction of\nrandom portions of the collection and the search for all the occurrences of a\ngiven pattern inside the whole collection.\n  A self-index is a data structure that stores a text in compressed form and\nallows to find the occurrences of a pattern efficiently. On the other hand,\nself-indexes can extract any substring of the collection, hence they are able\nto replace the original text. One of the main goals when using these indexes is\nto store them within main memory.\n  In this thesis we present a scheme for random text extraction from text\ncompressed with a Lempel-Ziv parsing.

Nowadays, continuous variable entanglement\nis regarded as an essential resource allowing for quantum enhanced measurement\nresolution, the realization of quantum teleportation and quantum memories, or\nthe demonstration of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. These applications\nrely on techniques to manipulate and detect coherences of quantum fields, the\nquadratures. While in optics coherent homodyne detection of quadratures is a\nstandard technique, for massive particles a corresponding method was missing.\nHere we report on the realization of an atomic analog to homodyne detection for\nthe measurement of matter-wave quadratures.

VSN creates a huge opportunity to extend\nthe road-side sensor infrastructure of existing traffic control systems. The\nefficient use of the wireless communication medium is one of the basic issues\nin VSN applications development. This paper introduces a novel method of\nselective data collection for traffic control applications, which provides a\nsignificant reduction in data amounts transmitted through VSN. The underlying\nidea is to detect the necessity of data transfers on the basis of uncertainty\ndetermination of the traffic control decisions. According to the proposed\napproach, sensor data are transmitted from vehicles to the control node only at\nselected time moments. Data collected in VSN are processed using on-line\ntraffic simulation technique, which enables traffic flow prediction,\nperformance evaluation of control strategies and uncertainty estimation. If\nprecision of the resulting information is insufficient, the optimal control\nstrategy cannot be derived without ambiguity. As a result the control decision\nbecomes uncertain and it is a signal informing that new traffic data from VSN\nare necessary to provide more precise prediction and to reduce the uncertainty\nof decision. The proposed method can be applied in traffic control systems of\ndifferent types e.g. traffic signals, variable speed limits, and dynamic route\nguidance. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated in an experimental\nstudy on traffic control at signalised intersection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 09:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-10"}

In order to probe the accretion and jet physical\nproperties in LLAGNs as a class, we model the broadband radio to X-rays\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 21 LLAGNs in low-ionization nuclear\nemission-line regions (LINERs) with a coupled accretion-jet model. The\naccretion flow is modeled as an inner ADAF outside of which there is a\ntruncated standard thin disk. We find that the radio emission is severely\nunderpredicted by ADAF models and is explained by the relativistic jet. The\norigin of the X-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by three\ndistinct scenarios: the X-rays can be dominated by emission from the ADAF, or\nthe jet, or the X-rays can arise from a jet-ADAF combination in which both\ncomponents contribute to the emission with similar importance. For 3 objects\nboth the jet and ADAF fit equally well the X-ray spectrum and can be the\ndominant source of X-rays whereas for 11 LLAGNs a jet-dominated model accounts\nbetter than the ADAF-dominated model for the data. The individual and average\nSED models that we computed can be useful for different studies of the nuclear\nemission of LLAGNs. From the model fits, we estimate important parameters of\nthe central engine powering LLAGNs in LINERs, such as the mass accretion rate\nand the mass-loss rate in the jet and the jet power - relevant for studies of\nthe kinetic feedback from jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 10:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-21"}

The simulations are run in a 35.12/h comoving Mpc box using a\nvariety of assumptions for the amplitude and power-law extreme-UV (EUV)\nspectral index, alpha, of the ionising emissivity. We use an empirically\nmotivated prescription for ionising sources which ensures all of the models are\nconsistent with constraints on the Thomson scattering optical depth and the\nhydrogen photo-ionisation rate at z=6. The inclusion of helium slightly delays\nreionisation due to the small number of ionising photons which reionise neutral\nhelium instead of hydrogen. However, helium has a significant impact on the\nthermal state of the IGM. Models with alpha=3 produce IGM temperatures at the\nmean density at z=6 which are about 20 % higher compared to models without\nhelium photo-heating. Harder EUV indices produce even larger IGM temperature\nboosts. A comparison to recent observational estimates of the IGM temperature\nat z=5 - 6 suggests that hydrogen reionisation was primarily driven by pop-II\nstellar sources with a soft EUV index, alpha<3. We also find that faint, as yet\nundetected galaxies, characterised by a luminosity function with a steepening\nfaint-end slope and an increasing Lyman continuum escape fraction (fesc=0.5),\nare required to reproduce the ionising emissivity used in our simulations at\nz>6. Finally, we note there is some tension between recent observational\nconstraints which indicate the IGM is > 10% neutral by volume z=7, and\nestimates of the ionising emissivity at z=6 which indicate only between 1 and 3\nionising photons are emitted per hydrogen atom over a Hubble time.

Motivated by\nrecent two-dimensional wind simulations, we vary the dynamical evolution during\nthe \\nu p-process and show that final abundances strongly depend on the\ntemperature evolution. When the expansion is very fast, there is not enough\ntime for antineutrino absorption on protons to produce enough neutrons to\novercome the \\beta-decay waiting points and no heavy elements beyond A=64 are\nproduced. The wind termination shock or reverse shock dramatically reduces the\nexpansion speed of the ejecta. This extends the period during which matter\nremains at relatively high temperatures and is exposed to high neutrino fluxes,\nthus allowing for further (p,\\gamma) and (n,p) reactions to occur and to\nsynthesize elements beyond iron. We find that the \\nu p-process starts to\nefficiently produce heavy elements only when the temperature drops below ~3 GK.\nAt higher temperatures, due to the low alpha separation energy of 60Zn\n(S_{\\alpha} = 2.7 MeV) the reaction 59Cu(p,\\alpha)56Ni is faster than the\nreaction 59Cu(p,\\gamma)60Zn. This results in the closed NiCu cycle that we\nidentify and discuss here for the first time. We also investigate the late\nphase of the \\nu p-process when the temperatures become too low to maintain\nproton captures. Depending on the late neutron density, the evolution to\nstability is dominated by \\beta decays or by (n,\\gamma) reactions. In the\nlatter case, the matter flow can even reach the neutron-rich side of stability\nand the isotopic composition of a given element is then dominated by\nneutron-rich isotopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 11:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

During this process, the core collapses to a\nneutron star or a black hole, while the outer layers are expelled with\nvelocities of thousands of kilometers per second. The resulting fireworks often\noutshine the entire host galaxy for many weeks.\n  The explosion energy is eventually radiated away, but powering of the newborn\nnebula continues by radioactive isotopes synthesized in the explosion.

Such a matrix\nwith maximum determinant is called a saturated D-optimal design. We consider\nsome cases where n > 2 is not divisible by 4, so the Hadamard bound is not\nattainable, but bounds due to Barba or Ehlich and Wojtas may be attainable. If\nR is a matrix with maximal (or conjectured maximal) determinant, then G = RR^T\nis the corresponding Gram matrix. For the cases that we consider, maximal or\nconjectured maximal Gram matrices are known. We show how to generate many\nHadamard equivalence classes of solutions from a given Gram matrix G, using a\nrandomised decomposition algorithm and row/column switching. In particular, we\nconsider orders 26, 27 and 33, and obtain new saturated D-optimal designs (for\norder 26) and new conjectured saturated D-optimal designs (for orders 27 and\n33).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 12:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2011 01:27:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2012 05:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 13:59:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2012 06:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}

The virus has two ways of spreading: either by allowing its host\ncell to live on and duplicate, or else by multiplying in large numbers within\nthe host cell such that the host cell finally bursts and the viruses then have\nthe chance to enter new uninfected host cells. The model, and in particular the\nprobability of the virus population surviving, is analyzed using the theory of\nMarkov processes together with a coupling argument. Our analysis shows that the\noptimal strategy of the virus (in terms of survival) is obtained when the virus\nhas no effect on the host cell's life-cycle, in agreement with experimental\ndata about real viruses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 14:16:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 13:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-30"}

In this\npaper we analyze this failure and show that it is associated with the presence\nof fast equilibration timescales that neither asymptotic nor quasi-steady-state\napproximations are able to remove efficiently from the numerical integration.\nBased on this understanding, we develop a partial equilibrium method to deal\neffectively with the approach to equilibrium and show that explicit asymptotic\nmethods, combined with the new partial equilibrium methods, give an integration\nscheme that plausibly can deal with the stiffest networks, even in the approach\nto equilibrium, with accuracy and speed competitive with that of implicit\nmethods. Thus we demonstrate that such explicit methods may offer alternatives\nto implicit integration of even extremely stiff systems, and that these methods\nmay permit integration of much larger networks than have been possible before\nin a number of fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 15:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 02:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-01"}

Phase diagrams of GCFL are\ndetermined, which are essentially the same with those of GCML.
