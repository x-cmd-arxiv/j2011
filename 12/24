The use of Baade-Wesselink methods for independent distance\ndeterminations could be significantly biased by the presence of these\nenvelopes. Although their observations are difficult because of the high\ncontrast between the photosphere of the star and the CSE, several observation\ntechniques have the potential to improve our knowledge about their physical\nproperties. In this thesis, I discuss in particular high angular resolution\ntechniques that I applied to the study of several bright Galactic Cepheids.\nFirst, I used adaptive optic observations with NACO of the Cepheid RS Puppis,\nin order to deduce the flux ratio between the CSE and the photosphere of the\nstar. In addition, I could carry out a statistical study of the speckle noise\nand inspect a possible asymmetry. Secondly, I analysed VISIR data to study the\nspectral energy distribution of a sample of Cepheids. These diffraction-limited\nimages enabled me to carry out an accurate photometry in the N band and to\ndetect an IR excess linked to the presence of a circumstellar component. On the\nother hand, applying a Fourier analysis I showed that some components are\nresolved. I then explored the K' band with the recombination instrument FLUOR\nfor some bright Cepheids. Thanks to new set of data of Y Oph, I improved the\nstudy of its circumstellar envelope, using a ring-like model for the CSE.

For $d=2$ we compute robustly the spectrum\nof the NtD operator via potential theory, Nystr\\\"{o}m discretization, and the\nCayley transform. At high frequencies (400 wavelengths across), with\neigenfrequency relative error $10^{-10}$, we show that the method is $10^3$\ntimes faster than standard ones based upon a root-search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 21:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-30"}

An important matrix\nfunction for which this is the case is the matrix exponential. Suppose the\nmatrix exponential of a given matrix times a given vector has to be computed.\nWe develop the approach of Druskin, Greenbaum and Knizhnerman (1998) and\ninterpret the sought-after vector as the value of a vector function satisfying\nthe linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) whose coefficients\nform the given matrix. The residual is then defined with respect to the\ninitial-value problem for this ODE system. The residual introduced in this way\ncan be seen as a backward error. We show how the residual can be computed\nefficiently within several iterative methods for the matrix exponential. This\ncompletely resolves the question of reliable stopping criteria for these\nmethods. Further, we show that the residual concept can be used to construct\nnew residual-based iterative methods.

This coordination is achieved by a network\nof autocrine and paracrine signalling molecules between cells of the osteoclast\nlineage and cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Mathematical modelling of\nsignalling between cells of both lineages can assist in the interpretation of\nexperimental data, clarify signalling interactions and help develop a deeper\nunderstanding of complex bone diseases. In this paper, we further develop a\nmathematical model of bone cell interactions by Pivonka et al. (2008) to\ninclude the proliferation of precursor osteoblasts into the model. This\ninclusion is important to be able to account for Wnt signalling, believed to\nplay an important role in anabolic responses of bone. We show that an increased\nrate of differentiation to precursor cells or an increased rate of\nproliferation of precursor osteoblasts themselves both result in increased bone\nmass. However, modelling these different processes separately enables the new\nmodel to represent recent experimental discoveries such as the role of Wnt\nsignalling in bone biology and the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells\nby transforming growth factor \\beta. Finally, we illustrate the power of the\nnew model's capabilities by applying the model to prostate cancer metastasis to\nbone. In the bone microenvironment, prostate cancer cells are believed to\nrelease some of the same signalling molecules used to coordinate bone\nremodelling (i.e. Wnt and PTHrP), enabling the cancer cells to disrupt normal\nsignalling and coordination between bone cells. This disruption can lead to\neither bone gain or bone loss.

We show\nthat the limit point is the common center of spiral similarities taking any of\nthe triad circles into another triad circle. As a consequence, the point has\nthe isoptic property (i.e., all triad circles are visible from the limit point\nat the same angle). Furthermore, the limit point can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of a circumcenter. It also has properties similar to those of\nthe isodynamic point of a triangle. We also characterize the limit point as the\nunique point for which the pedal quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

Our results show that N substitution\nenergetically prefers to occur at the carbon atoms near the defects, especially\nfor those sites with larger bond shortening, indicating that the defect-induced\nstrain plays an important role in the stability of N dopants in defective\ngraphene. In the presence of monovacancy, the most stable position for N dopant\nis the pyridinelike configuration, while for other point defects studied (SW\ndefect and divacancies) N prefers a site in the pentagonal ring. The effect of\nnative point defects on N dopants is quite strong: While the N doping is\nendothermic in defect-free graphene, it becomes exothermic for defective\ngraphene. Our results imply that the native point defect and N dopant attract\neach other, i.e., cooperative effect, which means that substitutional N dopants\nwould increase the probability of point defect generation and vice versa. Our\nfindings are supported by recent experimental studies on the N doping of\ngraphene. Furthermore we point out possibilities of aggregation of multiple N\ndopants near native point defects. Finally we make brief comments on the effect\nof Fe adsorption on the stability of N dopant aggregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2011 15:50:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 12:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-03"}

The performance of parallel\nimaging strongly depends on the reconstruction algorithm, which can proceed\neither in the original k-space (GRAPPA, SMASH) or in the image domain\n(SENSE-like methods). To improve the performance of the widely used SENSE\nalgorithm, 2D- or slice-specific regularization in the wavelet domain has been\ndeeply investigated. In this paper, we extend this approach using 3D-wavelet\nrepresentations in order to handle all slices together and address\nreconstruction artifacts which propagate across adjacent slices. The gain\ninduced by such extension (3D-Unconstrained Wavelet Regularized -SENSE:\n3D-UWR-SENSE) is validated on anatomical image reconstruction where no temporal\nacquisition is considered. Another important extension accounts for temporal\ncorrelations that exist between successive scans in functional MRI (fMRI). In\naddition to the case of 2D+t acquisition schemes addressed by some other\nmethods like kt-FOCUSS, our approach allows us to deal with 3D+t acquisition\nschemes which are widely used in neuroimaging. The resulting 3D-UWR-SENSE and\n4D-UWR-SENSE reconstruction schemes are fully unsupervised in the sense that\nall regularization parameters are estimated in the maximum likelihood sense on\na reference scan. The gain induced by such extensions is illustrated on both\nanatomical and functional image reconstruction, and also measured in terms of\nstatistical sensitivity for the 4D-UWR-SENSE approach during a fast\nevent-related fMRI protocol. Our 4D-UWR-SENSE algorithm outperforms the SENSE\nreconstruction at the subject and group levels (15 subjects) for different\ncontrasts of interest (eg, motor or computation tasks) and using different\nparallel acceleration factors (R=2 and R=4) on 2x2x3mm3 EPI images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 18:26:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 11:11:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 21:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-07"}
