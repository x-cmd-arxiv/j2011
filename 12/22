The obtained log-normal distributions together with the\ncharacteristics of polymer translocation suggest that it is describable as a\nmultiplicative stochastic process. In spite of its clear out-of-equilibrium\nnature the forced translocation is surprisingly similar to the unforced case.\nWe find forms for the distributions almost unaltered with a common cut-off\nlength. We show that the individual short-segment and short-time movements\ninside the pore give the scaling relations $\\tau \\sim N^\\alpha$ and $\\tau \\sim\nf^{-\\beta}$ for the polymer translocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 16:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 08:09:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 06:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-13"}

We describe a version of the SSB\nmechanism in which gravity plays a direct role. We work in the context of\ndiffeomorphism invariant gauge theories, which exist for any non-abelian gauge\ngroup G, and which have second order in derivatives field equations. We show\nthat any (non-trivial) vacuum solution of such a theory gives rise to an\nembedding of the group SU(2) into G, and thus breaks G down to SU(2) times its\ncentralizer in G. The components of the connection charged under SU(2) can then\nbe seen to describe gravitons, with the SU(2) itself playing the role of the\nchiral half of the Lorentz group. Components charged under the centralizer\ndescribe the usual Yang-Mills gauge bosons. The remaining components describe\nmassive particles. This breaking of symmetry explains (in the context of models\nconsidered) how gravity and Yang-Mills can come from a single underlying theory\nwhile being so different in the physics they describe. Further, varying the\nvacuum solution, and thus the embedding of SU(2) into G, one can break the\nYang-Mills gauge group as desired, with massless gauge bosons of one vacuum\nacquiring mass in another. There is no Higgs field in our version of the SSB\nmechanism, the only variable is a connection field. Instead of the symmetry\nbreaking by a dedicated Higgs field pointing in some direction in the field\nspace, our theories break the symmetry by choosing how the group of \"internal\"\ngauge rotations of gravity (the chiral half of the Lorentz group) sits inside\nthe full gauge group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 17:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Such tracks form the basis for\nversatile and flexible trigger conditions, e.g. single high-pt hadron, single\nhigh-pt electron, di-electron (J/Psi, Upsilon) and at least n close high-pt\ntracks (jet).\n  The need for low-latency on-line reconstruction poses challenges on the\ndetector operation. The calibration for gain (pad-by-pad) and drift velocity\nmust be applied already in the front-end electronics. Due to changes in\npressure and gas composition an on-line monitoring and feedback loop for these\nparameters is required. First experiences on the performance were gathered from\ntriggering in cosmic and pp runs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 17:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Quest-V uses virtualization techniques to isolate kernels and prevent\nlocal faults from affecting remote kernels. This leads to a high-confidence\nmultikernel approach, where failures of system subcomponents do not render the\nentire system inoperable. A virtual machine monitor for each kernel keeps track\nof shadow page table mappings that control immutable memory access\ncapabilities. This ensures a level of security and fault tolerance in\nsituations where a service in one kernel fails, or is corrupted by a malicious\nattack. Communication is supported between kernels using shared memory regions\nfor message passing. Similarly, device driver data structures are shareable\nbetween kernels to avoid the need for complex I/O virtualization, or\ncommunication with a dedicated kernel responsible for I/O. In Quest-V, device\ninterrupts are delivered directly to a kernel, rather than via a monitor that\ndetermines the destination. Apart from bootstrapping each kernel, handling\nfaults and managing shadow page tables, the monitors are not needed. This\ndiffers from conventional virtual machine systems in which a central monitor,\nor hypervisor, is responsible for scheduling and management of host resources\namongst a set of guest kernels. In this paper we show how Quest-V can implement\nnovel fault isolation and recovery techniques that are not possible with\nconventional systems. We also show how the costs of using virtualization for\nisolation of system services does not add undue overheads to the overall system\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 19:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

One implication of this relation is that there exist anisotropic\ntransmission resonances in PT-symmetric systems, frequencies at which there is\nunit transmission and zero reflection, but only for waves incident from a\nsingle side. The spatial profile of these transmission resonances is symmetric,\nand they can occur even at PT-symmetry breaking points. The general\nconservation relations can be utilized as an experimental signature of the\npresence of PT-symmetry and of PT-symmetry breaking transitions. The uniqueness\nof PT-symmetry breaking transitions of the scattering matrix is briefly\ndiscussed by comparing to the corresponding non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 21:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Of this number, the fraction realistically detectable may be\nconsiderably smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 21:48:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 23:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 13:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

There is now good evidence that linked selection plays an\nimportant role in shaping polymorphism levels in a number of species. One of\nthe best investigated models of linked selection is the recurrent full sweep\nmodel, in which newly arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of\nselected alleles that sweep into the population may not be destined for rapid\nfixation. Here we develop a general model of recurrent selective sweeps in a\ncoalescent framework, one that generalizes the recurrent full sweep model to\nthe case where selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a\nlarge population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected allele affects\nthe genealogy at partially linked sites, which under fairly general assumptions\nare unaffected by the subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the\ntheory to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial sweeps\non levels of neutral diversity, and find that for a given reduction in\ndiversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on the frequency spectrum at\nneutral sites is determined primarily by the frequencies achieved by the\nselected alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to low\nfrequencies can have a profound effect on levels of diversity but can leave the\nfrequency spectrum relatively unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent\nmodel under a high rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard\nneutral model.

In this paper, we consider eleven dynamical\nasteroids losing mass, in nine of which the ejected material is spatially\nresolved. We address mechanisms for producing mass loss including rotational\ninstability, impact ejection, electrostatic repulsion, radiation pressure\nsweeping, dehydration stresses and thermal fracture, in addition to the\nsublimation of ice.

For the other bodies, the mass loss mechanisms remain unidentified,\npending the acquisition of more and better data.

This makes NGC 3801 an ideal\nsystem for investigating the evolution of a small radio source through its host\ngalaxy's cold ISM. The large-scale HI disc is perpendicular to a known inner CO\ndisc and dust-lane.

In our\nmodel, all stars are initially formed as bound or unbound star clusters (SCs)\nformed from giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and the SCs can finally become GCs,\nopen clusters, and field stars depending on physical properties of their host\nGMCs. An essential ingredient of the model is that helium-rich stars are formed\nalmost purely from gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars. The helium-rich star formation is assumed to occur within massive SCs if\nthe masses of the progenitor GMCs are larger than a threshold mass (M_thres).\nThese massive SCs can finally become either massive GCs or helium-rich field\nstars depending on whether they are disintegrated or not.

F_He is found to depend on\nIMFs and M_thres such that it can be larger for shallower IMFs and smaller\nM_thres. The inner regions of galactic spheroids show larger F_He in almost all\nmodels. Based on these results, we suggest that if the UV upturn of elliptical\ngalaxies is due to the larger fractions of helium-rich stars, then the origin\ncan be closely associated with top-heavy IMFs in the galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2011 07:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In our previous papers, we showed that the\ninhomogeneous MRI developing in non-uniform structure of magnetic field or\nmagnetic resistivity can transform the local gas flow in the disk to a\nquasi-steady state with local rigid rotation that is no more unstable against\nthe MRI. Since the outer part of the rigid rotation is super-Keplerian flow, a\nquasi-static pressure bump is created and dust concentration is expected there.\nIn this paper, we perform simulations of the same systems, adding dust\nparticles that suffer gas drag and modulate gas flow via the back-reaction of\nthe gas drag (dust drag). We use O(10^7) super-particles, each of which\nrepresents many dust particles with sizes of centimeter to meter. We have found\nthat the dust drag suppresses turbulent motion to decrease the velocity\ndispersion of the dust particles while it broadens the dust concentrated\nregions to limit peaky dust concentration, compared with the simulation without\nthe dust drag.

For meter-size particles with\nthe friction time ~1/Omega, where Omega is Keplerian frequency, the\ngravitational instability of the dust particles that may lead to planetesimal\nformation is expected. For such a situation, we further introduced the\nself-gravity of dust particles to the simulation to demonstrate that several\ngravitationally bound clumps are actually formed. Through analytical arguments,\nwe found that the planetesimal formation from meter-sized dust particles can be\npossible at ~5AU, if dust spatial density is a few times larger than that in\nthe minimum mass solar nebula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2011 10:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

There is no general rule to attack the\nobservability of a nonlinear system, so most previous works addressed the\nobservability of the corresponding linearized system by implicitly assuming\nthat the original nonlinear system and the linearized one have identical\nobservability characteristics. Strapdown INS alignment is a nonlinear system\nthat has its own characteristics. Using the inherent properties of strapdown\nINS, e.g., the attitude evolution on the SO(3) manifold, we start from the\nbasic definition and develop a global and constructive approach to investigate\nthe observability of strapdown INS static and tumbling alignment, highlighting\nthe effects of the attitude maneuver on observability. We prove that strapdown\nINS alignment, considering the unknown constant sensor biases, will be\ncompletely observable if the strapdown INS is rotated successively about two\ndifferent axes and will be nearly observable for finite known unobservable\nstates (no more than two) if it is rotated about a single axis. Observability\nfrom a global perspective provides us with insights into and a clearer picture\nof the problem, shedding light on previous theoretical results on strapdown INS\nalignment that were not comprehensive or consistent.. The reporting of\ninconsistencies calls for a review of all linearization-based observability\nstudies in the vast literature. Extensive simulations with constructed ideal\nobservers and an extended Kalman filter are carried out, and the numerical\nresults accord with the analysis. The conclusions can also assist in designing\nthe optimal tumbling strategy and the appropriate state observer in practice to\nmaximize the alignment performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2011 11:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-19"}

The\nnon-linear differential equations are linearized and Gaussian white noise is\nadded to account for the non-linearities. The resulting linear stochastic\nsystem is conditioned on a set of solutions of the non-linear equations that\nhave been calculated prior to the emulation.

I focus on automatically inventing or discovering problems in a way\ninspired by the playful behavior of animals and humans, to train a more and\nmore general problem solver from scratch in an unsupervised fashion. Consider\nthe infinite set of all computable descriptions of tasks with possibly\ncomputable solutions. The novel algorithmic framework POWERPLAY (2011)\ncontinually searches the space of possible pairs of new tasks and modifications\nof the current problem solver, until it finds a more powerful problem solver\nthat provably solves all previously learned tasks plus the new one, while the\nunmodified predecessor does not. Wow-effects are achieved by continually making\npreviously learned skills more efficient such that they require less time and\nspace. New skills may (partially) re-use previously learned skills. POWERPLAY's\nsearch orders candidate pairs of tasks and solver modifications by their\nconditional computational (time & space) complexity, given the stored\nexperience so far. The new task and its corresponding task-solving skill are\nthose first found and validated. The computational costs of validating new\ntasks need not grow with task repertoire size. POWERPLAY's ongoing search for\nnovelty keeps breaking the generalization abilities of its present solver. This\nis related to Goedel's sequence of increasingly powerful formal theories based\non adding formerly unprovable statements to the axioms without affecting\npreviously provable theorems. The continually increasing repertoire of problem\nsolving procedures can be exploited by a parallel search for solutions to\nadditional externally posed tasks. POWERPLAY may be viewed as a greedy but\npractical implementation of basic principles of creativity. A first\nexperimental analysis can be found in separate papers [53,54].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2011 13:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 17:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}

Restricting to linearly dependent\nand equally likely pure states, we find the optimal positive operator valued\nmeasure (POVM) that maximizes our confidence in identifying each state in the\nset and minimizes the probability of obtaining inconclusive results. The\nphysical realization of this POVM is completely determined and it is shown that\nafter an inconclusive outcome, the input states may be mapped into a new set of\nequiprobable symmetric states, restricted, however, to a subspace of the\noriginal qudit Hilbert space. By applying the MC measurement again onto this\nnew set, we can still gain some information about the input states, although\nwith less confidence than before. This leads us to introduce the concept of\n\"sequential maximum-confidence\" (SMC) measurements, where the optimized MC\nstrategy is iterated in as many stages as allowed by the input set, until no\nfurther information can be extracted from an inconclusive result. Within each\nstage of this measurement our confidence in identifying the input states is the\nhighest possible, although it decreases from one stage to the next. In\naddition, the more stages we accomplish within the maximum allowed, the higher\nwill be the probability of correct identification.

[Journal of Chemical Physics 124,\n074103 (2006)] is reformulated, overcoming some of the numerical limitations\nencountered and extending its range of applicability. We first recast the\nproblem in terms of induced polarization charges that act as a direct mapping\nof the self-consistent continuum dielectric; this allows to define a functional\nform for the dielectric that is well behaved both in the high-density region of\nthe nuclear charges and in the low-density region where the electronic\nwavefunctions decay into the solvent. Second, we outline an iterative procedure\nto solve the Poisson equation for the quantum fragment embedded in the solvent\nthat does not require multi-grid algorithms, is trivially parallel, and can be\napplied to any Bravais crystallographic system. Last, we capture some of the\nnon-electrostatic or cavitation terms via a combined use of the quantum volume\nand quantum surface [Physical Review Letters 94, 145501 (2005)] of the solute.\nThe resulting self-consistent continuum solvation (SCCS) model provides a very\neffective and compact fit of computational and experimental data, whereby the\nstatic dielectric constant of the solvent and one parameter allow to fit the\nelectrostatic energy provided by the PCM model with a mean absolute error of\n0.3 kcal/mol on a set of 240 neutral solutes. Two parameters allow to fit\nexperimental solvation energies on the same set with a mean absolute error of\n1.3 kcal/mol. A detailed analysis of these results, broken down along different\nclasses of chemical compounds, shows that several classes of organic compounds\ndisplay very high accuracy, with solvation energies in error of 0.3-0.4\nkcal/mol, whereby larger discrepancies are mostly limited to self-dissociating\nspecies and strong hydrogen-bond forming compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2011 14:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

The wires should\nhave strong spin-orbit coupling with appropriate symmetry, and their electrons\nshould be partially polarized by a strong Zeeman field. Then, if the Fermi\nlevel is in an appropriate range, the wire can be in a topological\nsuperconducting phase, with Majorana states that occur at wire ends and at $Y$\njunctions, where three topological superconductor segments may be joined. Here\nwe generalize these ideas to consider a three-dimensional network. The\npositions of Majorana states can be manipulated, and their non-Abelian\nproperties made visible, by using external gates to selectively deplete\nportions of the network, or by physically connecting and redividing wire\nsegments. Majorana states can also be manipulated by reorientations of the\nZeeman field on a wire segment, by physically rotating the wire about almost\nany axis, or by evolution of the phase of the order parameter in the\nproximity-coupled superconductor. We show how to keep track of sign changes in\nthe zero-energy Hilbert space during adiabatic manipulations by monitoring the\nevolution of each Majorana state separately, rather than keeping track of the\nbraiding of all possible pairs. This has conceptual advantages in the case of a\nthree-dimensional network, and may be computationally useful even in two\ndimensions, if large numbers of Majorana sites are involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2011 14:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Taking advantage of the fact\nthat in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introduce\ndiscrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and the\nFourier bar mode. We apply these measures of shape first to a variety of\nsimulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in dark\nmatter halos and orbiting the Milky Way. In addition to strong mass loss and\nrandomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformation\nthat typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the first\npericenter passage. These tidally induced bars persist for a few Gyr before\nbeing shortened towards a more spherical shape if the tidal force is strong\nenough. We test this prediction by measuring in a similar way the shape of\nnearby dwarf galaxies, satellites of the Milky Way. We detect inner bars in\nUrsa Minor, Sagittarius, LMC and possibly Carina. In addition, six out of\neleven studied dwarfs show elongated stellar distributions in the outer parts\nthat may signify transition to tidal tails.

This feature\nhas been detected also in faint sources and at low luminosity levels,\nsuggesting that it is an ubiquitous phenomenon. In the case of the high\nluminosity pulsars (Lx > 10^36 erg/s), the fit of this component with thermal\nemission models usually provides low temperatures (kT < 0.5 keV) and large\nemission regions (R > a few hundred km); for this reason, it is referred to as\na `soft' excess. On the other hand, we recently found that in persistent,\nlow-luminosity (Lx ~ 10^34 erg/s) and long-period (P > 100 s) Be accreting\npulsars the observed excess can be modeled with a rather hot (kT > 1 keV)\nblackbody component of small area (R < 0.5 km), which can be interpreted as\nemission from the NS polar caps.
