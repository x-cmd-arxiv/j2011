The contributions to\nthe Casimir energy of electromagnetic excitations of different types (surface\nmodes, waveguide modes, and photonic modes) are clearly retraced. A correct\ntransition to imaginary frequencies is accomplished with allowance for all the\npeculiarities of the frequency equations and pertinent scattering data in the\ncomplex $\\omega $ plane, including, in particular, the cuts connecting the\nbranch points and complex roots of the frequency equations (quasi-normal\nmodes). The principal novelty of our approach is a special choice of\nappropriate passes in the contour integrals, which are used for transition to\nimaginary frequencies. As a result, the long standing problem of cuts in the\ncomplex $\\omega $ plane is solved completely. Inconsistencies of some previous\nderivations of the Lifshitz formula are traced briefly. For completeness of the\npresentation, the necessary mathematical facts are also stated, namely,\nsolution of the Maxwell equations for configurations under consideration,\nscattering formalism for parallel plane interfaces, determination of the\nfrequency equation roots, and others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 16:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 15:22:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 11:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To prevent improper\ndisclosure of confidential information, user queries posed on these views need\nto be rewritten into equivalent queries on the underlying documents. This\nrewriting enables us to avoid the overhead of view materialization and\nmaintenance. A major concern here is that query rewriting for recursive XML\nviews is still an open problem. To overcome this problem, some works have been\nproposed to translate XPath queries into non-standard ones, called Regular\nXPath queries. However, query rewriting under Regular XPath can be of\nexponential size as it relies on automaton model. Most importantly, Regular\nXPath remains a theoretical achievement. Indeed, it is not commonly used in\npractice as translation and evaluation tools are not available. In this paper,\nwe show that query rewriting is always possible for recursive XML views using\nonly the expressive power of the standard XPath. We investigate the extension\nof the downward class of XPath, composed only by child and descendant axes,\nwith some axes and operators and we propose a general approach to rewrite\nqueries under recursive XML views. Unlike Regular XPath-based works, we provide\na rewriting algorithm which processes the query only over the annotated DTD\ngrammar and which can run in linear time in the size of the query. An\nexperimental evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm is efficient and scales\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 16:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-13"}

We present ViP2P (standing for\nViews in Peer-to-Peer), a distributed platform for sharing XML documents based\non a structured P2P network infrastructure (DHT). At the core of ViP2P stand\ndistributed materialized XML views, defined by arbitrary XML queries, filled in\nwith data published anywhere in the network, and exploited to efficiently\nanswer queries issued by any network peer. ViP2P allows user queries to be\nevaluated over XML documents published by peers in two modes. First, a\nlong-running subscription mode, when a query can be registered in the system\nand receive answers incrementally when and if published data matches the query.\nSecond, queries can also be asked in an ad-hoc, snapshot mode, where results\nare required immediately and must be computed based on the results of other\nlong-running, subscription queries. ViP2P innovates over other similar\nDHT-based XML sharing platforms by using a very expressive structured XML query\nlanguage. This expressivity leads to a very flexible distribution of XML\ncontent in the ViP2P network, and to efficient snapshot query execution.

One way of understanding the relation among some of these metrics\nis the use of variable operating conditions (either in the form of\nmisclassification costs or class proportions). Thus, a metric may correspond to\nsome expected loss over a range of operating conditions. One dimension for the\nanalysis has been precisely the distribution we take for this range of\noperating conditions, leading to some important connections in the area of\nproper scoring rules. However, we show that there is another dimension which\nhas not received attention in the analysis of performance metrics. This new\ndimension is given by the decision rule, which is typically implemented as a\nthreshold choice method when using scoring models. In this paper, we explore\nmany old and new threshold choice methods: fixed, score-uniform, score-driven,\nrate-driven and optimal, among others. By calculating the loss of these methods\nfor a uniform range of operating conditions we get the 0-1 loss, the absolute\nerror, the Brier score (mean squared error), the AUC and the refinement loss\nrespectively. This provides a comprehensive view of performance metrics as well\nas a systematic approach to loss minimisation, namely: take a model, apply\nseveral threshold choice methods consistent with the information which is (and\nwill be) available about the operating condition, and compare their expected\nlosses. In order to assist in this procedure we also derive several connections\nbetween the aforementioned performance metrics, and we highlight the role of\ncalibration in choosing the threshold choice method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 18:03:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 09:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

The systematics studied include the effect of the input stellar\npopulation synthesis model, passband limitations and differences between\nindividual SED fits to pixels and global SED-fitting to a galaxy's colors. We\nfind that with optical-only colors, the systematic errors due to differences\namong the models are well constrained. The largest impact on the age and SFR\ne-folding time estimates in the pixels arises from differences between the\nMaraston models and the Bruzual&Charlot models, when optical colors are used.\nThis results in systematic differences larger than the 2{\\sigma} uncertainties\nin over 10 percent of all pixels in the galaxy sample. The effect of\nrestricting the available passbands is more severe. In 26 percent of pixels in\nthe full sample, passband limitations result in systematic biases in the age\nestimates which are larger than the 2{\\sigma} uncertainties. Systematic effects\nfrom model differences are reexamined using Near-IR colors for a subsample of\n46 galaxies in the GOODS-NICMOS survey. For z > 1, the observed optical/NIR\ncolors span the rest frame UV-optical SED, and the use of different models does\nnot significantly bias the estimates of the stellar population parameters\ncompared to using optical-only colors.

A\nkey characteristic of PLP frameworks is that they are conservative extensions\nto non-probabilistic logic programs which have been widely used for knowledge\nrepresentation. PLP frameworks extend traditional logic programming semantics\nto a distribution semantics, where the semantics of a probabilistic logic\nprogram is given in terms of a distribution over possible models of the\nprogram. However, the inference techniques used in these works rely on\nenumerating sets of explanations for a query answer. Consequently, these\nlanguages permit very limited use of random variables with continuous\ndistributions. In this paper, we present a symbolic inference procedure that\nuses constraints and represents sets of explanations without enumeration.

An interesting aspect of our inference procedure is that\nPRISM's query evaluation process becomes a special case in the absence of any\ncontinuous random variables in the program.

We quantify the grain charging at\ndifferent stages of disc evolution and differentiate between two very extreme\ncases: compact spherical grains and aggregates with fractal dimension D_f = 2.\nApplying a simple chemical network that accounts for collisional charging of\ngrains, we provide a semi-analytical solution. This allowed us to calculate the\nequilibrium population of grain charges and the ionisation fraction\nefficiently. The grain charging was evaluated for different dynamical\nenvironments ranging from static to non-stationary disc configurations. The\nresults show that the adsorption/desorption of neutral gas-phase heavy metals,\nsuch as magnesium, effects the charging state of grains. The greater the\ndifference between the thermal velocities of the metal and the dominant\nmolecular ion, the greater the change in the mean grain charge. Agglomerates\nhave more negative excess charge on average than compact spherical particles of\nthe same mass. The rise in the mean grain charge is proportional to N**(1/6) in\nthe ion-dust limit.

Moreover, quantum\nfluctuations are normally dominated by classical noise, and are usually further\nobstructed by various accompanying effects such as a detector backaction. In\npresent work, we demonstrate that these difficulties can be bypassed by\nperforming the cross-correlation measurements. We propose to use a pair of\ntwo-level detectors, weakly coupled to a collective mode of an electric\ncircuit. Fluctuations of the current source accumulated in the collective mode\ninduce stochastic transitions in the detectors. These transitions are then read\noff by quantum point contact (QPC) electrometers and translated into two\ntelegraph processes in the QPC currents. Since both detectors interact with the\nsame collective mode, this leads to a certain fraction of the correlated\ntransitions. These correlated transitions are fingerprinted in the\ncross-correlations of the telegraph processes, which can be detected at zero\nfrequency, i.e., with a long time measurements. Concerning the dependance of\nthe cross-correlator on the detectors' energy splittings, the most interesting\nregion is at the degeneracy points, where it exhibits a sharp non-local\nresonance, that stems from higher order processes. We find that at certain\nconditions the main contribution to this resonance comes from the quantum\nnoise. Namely, while the resonance line shape is weakly broadened by the\nclassical noise, the height of the peak is directly proportional to the square\nof the quantum component of the noise spectral function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 20:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2011 21:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}

Our technique exploits the fact the light curve derived stellar density\nmust be the same for all planets transiting a common star. Assuming a circular\norbit, the derived stellar density departs from the true value by a predictable\nfactor, Psi, which contains information on the eccentricity of the system. By\ncomparing multiple stellar densities, any differences must be due to\neccentricity and thus meaningful constraints can be placed in the absence of\nany other information. The technique, dubbed \"Multibody Asterodensity\nProfiling\" (MAP), is a new observable which can be used alone or in combination\nwith other observables, such as radial velocities and transit timing\nvariations.

However, the strength and form\nof this feedback is not understood. In this paper, we use the phenomenological\nmodel GALFORM to explore how galaxy formation depends on the strength and halo\nmass dependence of feedback. We focus on 'expulsion' models in which the wind\nmass loading, beta, is proportional to 1/\\vdisk^n, with n=0,1,2 and contrast\nthese models with the successful Bower et al.\\ 2008 model (B8W7). A crucial\ndevelopment is that our code explicitly accounts for the recapture of expelled\ngas as the system's halo mass (and thus gravitational potential) increases. We\nfind that a model with modest wind speed but high mass loading matches the flat\nportion of the SMF. When combined with AGN feedback, the model provides a good\ndescription of the observed SMF above 10^9 h^-1 Msol. However, in the expulsion\nmodels, the brightest galaxies are assembled more recently than in B8W7, and\nthe specific star formation rates of galaxies decrease strongly with decreasing\nstellar mass. The expulsion models also tend to have a cosmic star formation\ndensity that is dominated by lower mass galaxies at z=1-3, and dominated high\nmass galaxies at low redshift. These trends are in conflict with observational\ndata, but the comparison highlights some deficiencies of the B8W7 model also.\nThe experiments in this paper give us important physical insight to the impact\nof the feedback process on the formation histories of galaxies, but the strong\nmass dependence of feedback adopted in B8W7 still appears to provide the most\npromising description of the observed universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 21:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 00:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

EChO -the Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory- is a\nmission concept specifically geared for this purpose. EChO will provide\nsimultaneous, multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations on a stable platform\nthat will allow very long exposures. EChO will build on observations by Hubble,\nSpitzer and groundbased telescopes, which discovered the first molecules and\natoms in exoplanetary atmospheres. EChO will simultaneously observe a broad\nenough spectral region -from the visible to the mid-IR- to constrain from one\nsingle spectrum the temperature structure of the atmosphere and the abundances\nof the major molecular species. The spectral range and resolution are tailored\nto separate bands belonging to up to 30 molecules to retrieve the composition\nand temperature structure of planetary atmospheres. The target list for EChO\nincludes planets ranging from Jupiter-sized with equilibrium temperatures Teq\nup to 2000 K, to those of a few Earth masses, with Teq ~300 K. We have\nbaselined a dispersive spectrograph design covering continuously the 0.4-16\nmicron spectral range in 6 channels (1 in the VIS, 5 in the IR), which allows\nthe spectral resolution to be adapted from several tens to several hundreds,\ndepending on the target brightness. The instrument will be mounted behind a 1.5\nm class telescope, passively cooled to 50 K, with the instrument structure and\noptics passively cooled to ~45 K. EChO will be placed in a grand halo orbit\naround L2. We have also undertaken a first-order cost and development plan\nanalysis and find that EChO is easily compatible with the ESA M-class mission\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 21:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We compute the excess variance for all AGN, on different\ntime-scales (10, 20, 40 and 80 ks) and in different energy bands (0.3-0.7,\n0.7-2 and 2-10 keV). We observe a highly significant and tight (~0.7 dex)\ncorrelation between excess variance and MBH. The subsample of reverberation\nmapped AGN shows an even smaller scatter (~0.45 dex) comparable to the one\ninduced by the MBH uncertainties. This implies that X-ray variability can be\nused as an accurate tool to measure MBH and this method is more accurate than\nthe ones based on single epoch optical spectra. The excess variance vs.\naccretion rate dependence is weaker than expected based on the PSD break\nfrequency scaling, suggesting that both the PSD high frequency break and the\nnormalisation depend on accretion rate in such a way that they almost\ncompletely counterbalance each other. A highly significant correlation between\nexcess variance and 2-10 keV spectral index is observed. Both the variability\nvs. LBol and FWHM_Hbeta correlations are consistent with being just by-products\nof the correlation with MBH. The soft and medium variability is very well\ncorrelated with the hard variability, suggesting that the additional soft\ncomponents (i.e. soft excess, warm absorber) add a minor contribution to the\ntotal variability. Once the variability is rescaled for MBH and mdot, no\nsignificant difference between narrow-line and broad-line Seyfert 1 is\nobserved. The results are in agreement with a picture where, to first\napproximation, all local AGN have the same variability properties once rescaled\nfor MBH and accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 23:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

A\nstringent test of these models is to measure transitions for which the\ncorrection is predicted to be large. The decay of 32Cl decay provides such a\ntest case. Purpose: To improve the gamma yields following the beta decay of\n32Cl and to determine the ft values of the the beta branches, particularly the\none to the isobaric-analogue state in 32S. Method: Reaction-produced and\nrecoil-spectrometer-separated 32Cl is collected in tape and transported to a\ncounting location where beta-gamma coincidences are measured with a\nprecisely-calibrated HPGe detector. Results: The precision on the gamma yields\nfor most of the known beta branches has been improved by about an order of\nmagnitude, and many new transitions have been observed. We have determined\n32Cl-decay transition strengths extending up to E_x~11 MeV. The ft value for\nthe decay to the isobaric-analogue state in 32S has been measured.

For much of the early\nhistory of the Kuiper belt, studies of the compositions of these objects were\nrelegated to collections of moderate quality spectral and photometric data that\nremained difficult to interpret. Much early effort was put into simple\ncorrelations of surface colors and identifications of spectral features, but it\nwas difficult to connect the observations to a larger understanding of the\nregion. The last decade, however, has seen a blossoming in our understanding of\nthe compositions of objects in the Kuiper belt. This blossoming is a product of\nthe discoveries of larger -- and thus easier to study -- objects, continued\ndedication to the collection of a now quite large collection of high quality\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations, and continued work at the\nlaboratory and theoretical level. Today we now know of many processes which\naffect the surface compositions of objects in the Kuiper belt, including\natmospheric loss, differentiation and cryovolcanism, radiation processing, the\neffects of giant impacts, and the early dynamical excitation of the Kuiper\nbelt. We review the large quantity of data now available and attempt to build a\ncomprehensive framework for understanding the surface compositions and their\ncauses. In contrast to surface compositions, the bulk compositions of objects\nin the Kuiper belt remain poorly measured and even more poorly understood, but\nprospects for a deeper understanding of the formation of the the outer solar\nare even greater from this subject.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 00:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It is observed that\nthe thermocapillary motion of planar droplets in the uniform temperature\ngradients is steady at moderate Marangoni numbers, but unsteady at large\nMarangoni numbers. The instantaneous migration velocity at a fixed migration\ndistance decreases with increasing Marangoni numbers. The simulation results of\nthe thermocapillary droplet migration at large Marangoni numbers are found in\nqualitative agreement with those of experimental investigations. Moreover, the\nresults concerned with steady and unsteady migration processes are further\nconfirmed by comparing the variations of temperature fields inside and outside\nthe droplet. It is evident that at large Marangoni numbers the weak transport\nof thermal energy from outside of the droplet into inside cannot satisfy the\ncondition of steady migration process, which implies that the advection around\nthe droplet is a more significant mechanism for heat transfer across/around the\ndroplet at large Ma numbers. Furthermore, from the condition of overall\nsteady-state energy balance in the flow domain, the thermal flux across its\nsurface is studied for a steady thermocapillary droplet migration in a flow\nfield with uniform temperature gradient. By using the asymptotic expansion\nmethod, a nonconservative integral thermal flux across the surface is\nidentified in the steady thermocapillary droplet migration at large Marangoni\nnumbers. This nonconservative flux may well result from the invalid assumption\nof quasi-steady state, which indicates that the thermocapillary droplet\nmigration at large Marangoni numbers cannot reach steady state and is thus a\nunsteady process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 01:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-14"}

A measure of tie strength induces a ranking on\nthe edges (and on the set of neighbors for every person). We show that for\napplications where the ranking, and not the absolute value of the tie strength,\nis the important thing about the measure, the axioms are equivalent to a\nnatural partial order.

We classify\nmeasures found in prior literature according to the axioms that they satisfy.\nIn our experiments, we measure tie strength and the coverage of our axioms in\nseveral datasets.

These keys are stored in a key\nbuffer and later used to secure delay sensitive data using the Vernam's one\ntime pad technique.

The theory of this new order type and continuous, monotone function\nbetween set systems corresponds to the theory of well quasi-orderings (WQOs).\nAs Nash-Williams developed the theory of WQOs to the theory of better\nquasi-orderings (BQOs), we introduce a set system that has order type and\ncorresponds to a BQO.

The key idea is to\ndevelop models and derive results from the time perspective. Particularly, we\ndefine traffic models and service models based on the cumulative packet\ninter-arrival time and the cumulative packet service time, respectively.\nRelations among these models as well as with the existing models in the\nliterature are established.

These quantities are then fitted via rational functions.\nThe resulting analytically represented test-mass knowledge is then suitably\n{\\it hybridized} with lower-order analytical information that is valid for any\nmass ratio. This yields a resummed representation of the absorbed flux for a\ngeneric, circularized, nonspinning black-hole binary. Our result adds new\ninformation to the state-of-the-art calculation of the absorbed flux at\nfractional 5 post-Newtonian order [S. Taylor and E. Poisson, Phys. Rev.

The\navailability of small sets of lines also does not worsen the performance of the\nMCMC technique, provided these lines are formed in a wide temperature range.\nOur analysis shows the present limitations in our ability to identify the\npresence of strictly isothermal plasmas in stellar and solar coronal spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 10:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The most well-known case is the exchange\ninteraction that leads to magnetic order in some materials. We discovered a new\nsimilar process occurring in connection with an electronic phase separation\ntransition that leads to charge inhomogeneity in cuprate superconductors. The\nminimization of the local free energy, described here by the Cahn-Hilliard\ndiffusion equation, drives the charges into regions of low and high densities.\nThis motion leads to an effective potential with two-fold effect: creation of\ntiny isolated regions or micrograins, and two-body attraction, which promotes\nlocal or intra-grain superconducting pairing. Consequently, as in granular\nsuperconductors, the superconducting transition appears in two steps. First,\nwith local intra-grain superconducting amplitudes and, at lower temperature,\nthe superconducting phase or resistivity transition is attained by intergrain\nJosephson coupling.

It was observed with several telescopes (ESO NTT, La Silla;\nGemini North, Mauna Kea; UH 2.2m, Mauna Kea) from 14 Jan. until 19 Feb. 2010 in\norder to characterize and monitor it and its very unusual dust tail, which\nappears almost fully detached from the nucleus; the head of the tail includes\ntwo narrow arcs forming a cross. The immediate surroundings of the nucleus were\nfound dust-free, which allowed an estimate of the nucleus radius of 80-90m. A\nmodel of the thermal evolution indicates that such a small nucleus could not\nmaintain any ice content for more than a few million years on its current\norbit, ruling out ice sublimation dust ejection mechanism. Rotational spin-up\nand electrostatic dust levitations were also rejected, leaving an impact with a\nsmaller body as the favoured hypothesis, and ruling out the cometary nature of\nthe object.\n  The impact is further supported by the analysis of the tail structure.\nFinston-Probstein dynamical dust modelling indicates the tail was produced by a\nsingle burst of dust emission. More advanced models, independently indicate\nthat this burst populated a hollow cone with a half-opening angle alpha~40degr\nand with an ejection velocity v_max ~ 0.2m/s, where the small dust grains fill\nthe observed tail, while the arcs are foreshortened sections of the burst cone.\nThe dust grains in the tail are measured to have radii between a=1-20mm, with a\ndifferential size distribution proportional to a^(-3.44 +/- 0.08). The dust\ncontained in the tail is estimated to at least 8x10^8kg, which would form a\nsphere of 40m radius. Analysing these results in the framework of crater\nphysics, we conclude that a gravity-controlled crater would have grown up to\n~100m radius, i.e. comparable to the size of the body. The non-disruption of\nthe body suggest this was an oblique impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 13:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Dependent on the interaction energy, $W$, the\ncolor-gauge-invariant dipole interaction with the gluon field in the nucleon,\nfor any fixed dipole size, contains the limits of i) color transparency and ii)\nsaturation, where \"saturation\" stands for the approach to a hadronlike\ndipole-proton interaction cross section. All essential features of the\nexperimental results on low-x DIS, as a consequence of the\ncolor-gauge-invariant dipole interaction follow model independently i.e.\nwithout specific ansatz for the dipole cross section.

In this\npaper we study the evolution of the WTW using a recently-proposed family of\nnull network models. The method allows to analytically obtain the expected\nvalue of any network statistic across the ensemble of networks that preserve on\naverage some local properties, and are otherwise fully random. We compare\nexpected and observed properties of the WTW in the period 1950-2000, when\neither the expected number of trade partners or total country trade is kept\nfixed and equal to observed quantities.

Conversely, in the weighted WTW, the observed sequence\nof total country imports and exports are not sufficient to predict higher-order\npatterns of the WTW.

Most of these stars cluster in a small temperature range\nbetween 27000 K and 31000 K very similar to the known helium-3-rich main\nsequence B stars, which cluster at somewhat lower temperatures. This phenomenon\nis most probably related to diffusion processes in the atmosphere, but poses a\nchallenge to diffusion models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 15:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-14"}

Mechanical instabilities mainly affect\nunbalanced cold hanging glaciers. For the latter case, a prediction could be\nachieved based on data of surface velocities and seismic activity. The case of\nsliding instabilities is more problematic. This phenomenon occurs on temperate\nglacier tongues. Such instabilities are strongly affected by the subglacial\nhydrology: melt water may cause (i) a lubrication of the bed and (ii) a\ndecrease of the effective pressure and consequently a decrease of basal\nfriction. Available data from Allalingletscher (Valais) indicate that the\nglacier tongue experienced an active phase during 2-3 weeks with enhanced basal\nmotion in late summer in most years. In order to scrutinize in more detail the\nprocesses governing the sliding instabilities, a numerical model developed to\ninvestigate gravitational instabilities in heterogeneous media was applied to\nAllalingletscher. This model enables to account for various geometric\nconfigurations, interaction between sliding and tension cracking and water flow\nat the bedrock. We could show that both a critical geometrical configuration of\nthe glacier tongue and the existence of a distributed drainage network were the\nmain causes of this catastrophic break-off. Moreover, the analysis of the\nmodeling results diagnose the phenomenon of recoupling of the glacier to its\nbed as a potential new precursory sign announcing the final break-off. This\nmodel casts a gleam of hope for a better understanding of the ultimate rupture\nof such glacier sliding instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 15:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-06"}
