Counterterms are\nconstructed in details in the NLO of the large-N expansion. The\nrenormalizability is demonstrated at the same level of the approximation also\nwith eliminating the auxiliary field.\n  In the one component \\phi^4 model (at T=0) a method using renormalization\nconditions is developed, which gives directly finite equations for the 1- and\n2-point functions. This solves the problems of numerical precision of the\ncounterterm formulated renormalization. In the two-loop 2PI approximation the\nequivalence of the new method and the procedure formulated with counterterms is\nshown, both analytically and numerically. For the counterterm method also a new\nalgorithm is developed, which accelerates the numerical convergence.\n  In the U(N)xU(N) model, an approximate solution of the field equations in the\nlarge-N limit is found in the broken phase, for a condensate proportional to\nthe unit matrix. The approximation assumes the presence of a mass-hierarchy\nbetween the scalar and pseudoscalar fields. The validity of the latter\nassumption is investigated in the whole parameter space numerically. The\nstability of the solution against a more general condensate is checked. It is\nshown that, there exists a region of the parameter space, where the condensate\ncorresponding to the \"8\" direction of the SU(3) classification can arise\nspontaneously. This solution is found to be metastable, but could transform\ninto the true ground state, when a moderate external source is applied along\nthe \"8\" direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 16:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}

Besides, BAOs\nprovide a standard ruler for studying cosmic expansion. In this paper we focus\non methods for BAO detection using the correlation function measurement. For\neach method, we want to understand the tested hypothesis (the hypothesis H0 to\nbe rejected) and the underlying assumptions. We first present wavelet methods\nwhich are mildly model-dependent and mostly sensitive to the BAO feature. Then\nwe turn to fully model-dependent methods. We present the most often used method\nbased on the chi^2 statistic, but we find it has limitations. In general the\nassumptions of the chi^2 method are not verified, and it only gives a rough\nestimate of the significance. The estimate can become very wrong when\nconsidering more realistic hypotheses, where the covariance matrix of the\nmeasurement depends on cosmological parameters. Instead we propose to use a new\nmethod based on two modifications: we modify the procedure for computing the\nsignificance and make it rigorous, and we modify the statistic to obtain better\nresults in the case of varying covariance matrix. We verify with simulations\nthat correct significances are different from the ones obtained using the\nclassical chi^2 procedure. We also test a simple example of varying covariance\nmatrix. In this case we find that our modified statistic outperforms the\nclassical chi^2 statistic when both significances are correctly computed.\nFinally we find that taking into account variations of the covariance matrix\ncan change both BAO detection levels and cosmological parameter constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 16:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The\ncorresponding Fermi surface topology and the pairing symmetry are similar to\nCe-based heavy-fermion superconductors. Furthermore, when the Fermi surface\nhosts only electron-pockets in KyFe2-xSe2, the inter-electron-pocket nesting\ninduces a nodeless and isotropic d-wave pairing. This situation is analogous to\nthe electron-doped cuprates, where the strong antiferromagnetic order creates\nsimilar disconnected electron-pocket Fermi surface, and hence nodeless d-wave\npairing appears. The unit-cell transformation in KyFe2-xSe2 exhibits that the\nd-wave pairing breaks the translational symmetry of the 2 Fe unit cell, and\nthus cannot be realized unless a vacancy ordering forms to compensate for it.\nThese results are consistent with the coexistence picture of a competing order\nand nodeless d-wave superconductivity in both cuprates and KyFe1.6Se2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 17:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-26"}

The CoRoT space mission allows us to achieve a very high\nphotometric accuracy. By combining CoRoT data with high-precision radial\nvelocity measurements, we derive precise planetary radii and masses. We report\nthe discovery of CoRoT-19b, a gas-giant planet transiting an old, inactive\nF9V-type star with a period of four days. After excluding alternative physical\nconfigurations mimicking a planetary transit signal, we determine the radius\nand mass of the planet by combining CoRoT photometry with high-resolution\nspectroscopy obtained with the echelle spectrographs SOPHIE, HARPS, FIES, and\nSANDIFORD.

The\nfocus is made on the fluctuations of the spatial (Eulerian) and temporal\n(Lagrangian) velocity increments. The universal nature of the intermittency\nphenomenon as observed in experimental measurements and numerical simulations\nis shown to be fully taken into account by the multiscale picture proposed by\nthe multifractal formalism, and its extensions to the dissipative scales and to\nthe Lagrangian framework. The article is devoted to the presentation of these\narguments and to their comparisons against empirical data. In particular,\nexplicit predictions of the statistics, such as probability density functions\nand high order moments, of the velocity gradients and acceleration are derived.\nIn the Eulerian framework, at a given Reynolds number, they are shown to depend\non a single parameter function called the singularity spectrum and to a\nuniversal constant governing the transition between the inertial and\ndissipative ranges. The Lagrangian singularity spectrum compares well with its\nEulerian counterpart by a transformation based on incompressibility,\nhomogeneity and isotropy and the remaining constant is shown to be difficult to\nestimate on empirical data. It is finally underlined the limitations of the\nincrement to quantify accurately the singular nature of Lagrangian velocity.\nThis is confirmed using higher order increments unbiased by the presence of\nlinear trends, as they are observed on velocity along a trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 19:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 15:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

We show for our extended\nmodel that it is decidable in polynomial time if there exists a controller that\nachieves stability. Moreover, if such a controller exists, one can efficiently\ncompute a static randomized controller which stabilizes the network in a very\nstrong sense; in particular, all moments of the queue sizes are finite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 19:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}

A non-malleable\nextractor is a much stronger version of a strong extractor. Previously, there\nare only two known constructions of non-malleable extractors. Both\nconstructions only work for (n, k)-sources with k>n/2. Interestingly, both\nconstructions are also two-source extractors.\n  In this paper, we present a strong connection between non-malleable\nextractors and two-source extractors. The first part of the connection shows\nthat non-malleable extractors can be used to construct two-source extractors.\nWith appropriate parameters the resulted two-source extractor beats the best\nknown construction of two-source extractors. This partially explains why\nprevious constructions of non-malleable extractors only work for sources with\nentropy rate >1/2, and why explicit non-malleable extractors for small\nmin-entropy may be hard to get. The second part of the connection shows that\ncertain two-source extractors can be used to construct non-malleable\nextractors. Using this connection, we obtain the first construction of\nnon-malleable extractors for k < n/2. Specifically, we give an unconditional\nconstruction for min-entropy k=(1/2-\\delta)n for some constant \\delta>0, and a\nconditional (semi-explicit) construction that can potentially achieve k=\\alpha\nn for any constant \\alpha>0.\n  Finally, despite the lack of explicit non-malleable extractors for\narbitrarily linear entropy, we give the first 2-round privacy amplification\nprotocol with asymptotically optimal entropy loss and communication complexity\nfor (n, k) sources with k=\\alpha n for any constant \\alpha>0. This dramatically\nimproves previous results and answers an open problem in \\cite{DLWZ11}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 20:07:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 06:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We use numerical simulations of merging\ndisc galaxies to investigate which mechanism dominates. The simulations include\na model for the formation and dynamical disruption of the entire star cluster\npopulation. We find that the dynamical heating of clusters by tidal shocks is\nabout an order of magnitude higher in interacting galaxies than in isolated\ngalaxies. This is driven by the increased gas density, and is sufficient to\ndestroy star clusters at a higher rate than new clusters are formed: the total\nnumber of clusters in the merger remnant is 2-50% of the amount in the\nprogenitor discs, with low-mass clusters being disrupted preferentially. By\nadopting observationally motivated selection criteria, we find that the\nobserved surplus of star clusters in nearby merging galaxies is caused by the\nbias to detect young, massive clusters. We provide a general expression for the\nsurvival fraction of clusters, which increases with the gas depletion\ntime-scale. Due to the preferential disruption of low-mass clusters, the mass\ndistribution of the surviving star clusters in a merger remnant develops a peak\nat a mass of about 10^3 Msun, which evolves to higher masses at a rate of\n0.3-0.4 dex per Gyr. The peak mass initially depends weakly on the\ngalactocentric radius, but this correlation disappears as the system ages. We\ndiscuss the similarities between the cluster populations of the simulated\nmerger remnants and (young) globular cluster systems. Our results suggest that\nthe combination of cluster formation and destruction should be widespread in\nthe dense star-forming environments at high redshifts, which could provide a\nnatural origin to present-day globular cluster systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We also estimate dark matter halo masses\nof the satellites, and find that there is no sign that the luminosity of these\ngalaxies depends on their dark halo mass, a result consistent with what is seen\nfor MW dwarfs.

We investigate how a realistic red sequence population\nset up by z~1 evolves under different assumptions for the merger and star\nformation histories, comparing changes in color, luminosity and mass. The\npurely passive fading of existing red sequence galaxies, with no further\nmergers or star formation, results in dramatic changes at the bright end of the\nluminosity function and color-magnitude relation. Without mergers there is too\nmuch evolution in luminosity at a fixed space density compared to observations.\nThe change in color and magnitude at a fixed mass resemble that of a passively\nevolving population that formed relatively recently, at z~2. Mergers amongst\nthe red sequence population (\"dry mergers\") occurring after z=1 build up mass,\ncounteracting the fading of the existing stellar populations to give smaller\nchanges in both color and luminosity for massive galaxies. By allowing some\ngalaxies to migrate from the blue cloud onto the red sequence after z=1 through\ngas-rich mergers, younger stellar populations are added to the red sequence.\nThis manifestation of the progenitor bias increases the scatter in age and\nresults in even smaller changes in color and luminosity between z=1 and z=0 at\na fixed mass. The resultant evolution appears much slower, resembling the\npassive evolution of a population that formed at high redshift (z~3-5) and is\nin closer agreement with observations. Measurements of the luminosity and color\nevolution alone are not sufficient to distinguish between the purely passive\nevolution of an old population and cosmologically motivated hierarchical\ngrowth, although these scenarios have very different implications for the mass\ngrowth of early-type galaxies over the last half of cosmic history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 16:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-15"}

First, we\nshow that a motive which becomes of abelian type after a base field extension\nof algebraically closed fields is of abelian type. Given a field extension\n$K/k$ and a motive $M$ over $k$, we also show that $M$ is finite-dimensional if\nand only if $M_K$ is finite-dimensional. As a corollary, we obtain\nChow--Kuenneth decompositions for varieties that become isomorphic to an\nabelian variety after some field extension.

Their stability depends critically on their coordination number $z$.\n$d$-dimensional lattices with $z=2d$ are at the threshold of mechanical\nstability and are isostatic. Lattices with $z<2d$ exhibit zero-frequency\n\"floppy\" modes that provide avenues for lattice collapse. The physics of\nsystems as diverse as architectural structures, network glasses, randomly\npacked spheres, and biopolymer networks is strongly influenced by a nearby\nisostatic lattice. We explore elasticity and phonons of a special class of\ntwo-dimensional isostatic lattices constructed by distorting the kagome\nlattice. We show that the phonon structure of these lattices, characterized by\nvanishing bulk moduli and thus negative Poisson ratios and auxetic elasticity,\ndepends sensitively on boundary conditions and on the nature of the kagome\ndistortions. We construct lattices that under free boundary conditions exhibit\nsurface floppy modes only or a combination of both surface and bulk floppy\nmodes; and we show that bulk floppy modes present under free boundary\nconditions are also present under periodic boundary conditions but that surface\nmodes are not.

This condition guarantees that an eavesdropper cannot\ndisguise his presence by simply replacing the original transmission line with a\nless faulty one. Unfortunately, this condition also limits the possible\ndistance between the communicating parties, Alice and Bob, to a few hundred\nkilometers. To overcome this problem, we design a QKD protocol which allows\nAlice and Bob to distinguish system errors from eavesdropping errors. If they\nare able to identify the origin of their errors, they can detect eavesdropping\neven when the system error rate exceeds the eavesdropping error rate. To\nachieve this, the proposed protocol employs an alternative encoding of\ninformation in two-dimensional photon states. Errors manifest themselves as\nquantum bit and as index transmission errors with a distinct correlation\nbetween them in case of intercept-resend eavesdropping. As a result, Alice and\nBob can tolerate lower eavesdropping and higher system error rates without\ncompromising their privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 22:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-07"}

A natural problem\nwhich abstracts applications such as itinerary planning, playlist\nrecommendation, and flow analysis in information networks is that of finding\nthe heaviest path(s) in a graph. More precisely, we can model these\napplications as a graph with non-negative edge weights, along with a monotone\nfunction such as sum, which aggregates edge weights into a path weight,\ncapturing some notion of quality. We are then interested in finding the top-k\nheaviest simple paths, i.e., the $k$ simple (cycle-free) paths with the\ngreatest weight, whose length equals a given parameter $\\ell$. We call this the\n\\emph{Heavy Path Problem} (HPP). It is easy to show that the problem is\nNP-Hard.\n  In this work, we develop a practical approach to solve the Heavy Path problem\nby leveraging a strong connection with the well-known Rank Join paradigm. We\nfirst present an algorithm by adapting the Rank Join algorithm. We identify its\nlimitations and develop a new exact algorithm called HeavyPath and a scalable\nheuristic algorithm.

Measurements of the main forces governing\nthe {\\it C. elegans} crawling gait on lubricated surfaces have been scarce,\nprimarily due to difficulties in estimating the physical features at the\nnematode-gel interface. Using kinematic data and a hydrodynamic model based on\nlubrication theory, we calculate both the surface drag forces and the\nnematode's bending force while crawling on the surface of agar gels. We find\nthat the normal and tangential surface drag force coefficients during crawling\nare approximately 220 and 22, respectively, and the drag coefficient ratio is\napproximately 10. During crawling, the calculated internal bending force is\ntime-periodic and spatially complex, exhibiting a phase lag with respect to the\nnematode's body bending curvature. This phase lag is largely due to viscous\ndrag forces, which are higher during crawling as compared to swimming in an\naqueous buffer solution. The spatial patterns of bending force generated during\neither swimming or crawling correlate well with previously described\ngait-specific features of calcium signals in muscle. Further, our analysis\nindicates that changes in the motility gait of {\\it C. elegans} is most likely\ndue to the nematode's adaptive response to environments characterized by\ndifferent drag coefficient ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 23:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

For $w>-1$, however, the constraints are\npoor. For $w=-1$, $\\sigma_D$ can formally take any value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 00:21:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 05:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

A doubly-linked list\nis a simple and very commonly used data structure in file systems but it is not\nvery friendly to multi-threaded use. While special cases of lists, such as\nqueues and stacks, have lock-free versions that scale reasonably well, the\ngeneral form of a doubly-linked list offers no such solution. Using a mutex to\nserialize all operations remains the de-facto method of maintaining a doubly\nlinked list. This severely limits the scalability of the list and developers\nmust resort to ad-hoc workarounds that involve using multiple smaller lists\n(with individual locks) and deal with the resulting complexity of the system.\nIn this paper, we present an approach to building highly concurrent data\nstructures, with special focus on the implementation of highly concurrent\ndoubly-linked lists.

By invoking the Cauchy problem of relativity it is shown how,\nunder very precise astrophysical conditions, the Einstein general theory of\nrelativity is formally equivalent to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of\nsuperconductivity. This fact lead us to suspect that the superconductivity of\ngravitation ought to be a real physical process occurring in the outskirts of\ngalaxies. It is found that quantum mechanically gravity can achieve a type-II\nsuperconductor state characterised by the Gizburg-Landau parameter\n$\\kappa=1.5$, and it is suggested that a probability flux of Cooper pairs\n(quantum gravitational geons charged with vacuum energy) are directly\nresponsible for the flatness exhibited by the rotation curves in spiral\ngalaxies, as well as the exotic behaviour observed in galactic cluster\ncollisions. If this hypothesis proves correct, the whole phenomenon of dark\nmatter may count, after all, as another triumph for Einstein's theory of\ngravity. The tension between gravitation and quantum mechanics is explored\nfurther by a subtle consideration of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of the\nYork-time action, providing additional motivation for the above line of\nreasoning.

The cost of effectively and accurately computing\npairwise network distances can become prohibitive in large-scale networks such\nas the Internet and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. To negotiate the rising need\nfor very efficient distance computation, approximation techniques for numerous\nvariants of this question have recently received significant attention in the\nliterature. The goal is to preprocess the graph and store a small amount of\ninformation such that whenever a query for any pairwise distance is issued, the\ndistance can be well approximated (i.e., with small stretch) very quickly in an\nonline fashion. Specifically, the pre-processing (usually) involves storing a\nsmall sketch with each node, such that at query time only the sketches of the\nconcerned nodes need to be looked up to compute the approximate distance. In\nthis paper, we present the first theoretical study of distance sketches derived\nfrom distance oracles in a distributed network. We first present a fast\ndistributed algorithm for computing approximate distance sketches, based on a\ndistributed implementation of the distance oracle scheme of [Thorup-Zwick, JACM\n2005]. We also show how to modify this basic construction to achieve different\ntradeoffs between the number of pairs for which the distance estimate is\naccurate and other parameters. These tradeoffs can then be combined to give an\nefficient construction of small sketches with provable average-case as well as\nworst-case performance. Our algorithms use only small-sized messages and hence\nare suitable for bandwidth-constrained networks, and can be used in various\nnetworking applications such as topology discovery and construction, token\nmanagement, load balancing, monitoring overlays, and several other problems in\ndistributed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 10:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-07"}

When assigned a server, a node can execute a task. The\ntasks are independently generated at each node by stochastically symmetric and\nmemoryless random processes and stored in a finite-capacity task queue.\nMoreover, they are time-sensitive in the sense that within each slot there is a\nnon-zero probability that a task expires before being scheduled. The scheduling\nproblem is tackled with the aim of maximizing the number of tasks completed\nover time (or the task-throughput) under the assumption that the CC has no\ndirect access to the state of the task queues. The scheduling decisions at the\nCC are based on the outcomes of previous scheduling commands, and on the known\nstatistical properties of the task generation and expiration processes. Based\non a Markovian modeling of the task generation and expiration processes, the CC\nscheduling problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP) that can be cast into the framework of restless multi-armed\nbandit (RMAB) problems. When the task queues are of capacity one, the\noptimality of a myopic (or greedy) policy is proved. It is also demonstrated\nthat the MP coincides with the Whittle index policy. For task queues of\narbitrary capacity instead, the myopic policy is generally suboptimal, and its\nperformance is compared with an upper bound obtained through a relaxation of\nthe original problem. Overall, the settings in this paper provide a rare\nexample where a RMAB problem can be explicitly solved, and in which the Whittle\nindex policy is proved to be optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 10:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 13:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

That is, we treat in a conceptual unity the poles of the\n(generalized) topological zeta function and the monodromy eigenvalues\nassociated with a complex analytic function germ f defined on a normal surface\nsingularity (X,0). The article targets the `right' extension in the case when\nthe link of (X,0) is a homology sphere. As a first step, we prove a splice\ndecomposition formula for the topological zeta function Z(f,w;s) for any f and\nanalytic differential form w, which will play the key technical localization\ntool in the later definitions and proofs.\n  Then, we define a set of `allowed' differential forms via a local restriction\nalong each splice component. For plane curves we show the following three\nguiding properties: (1) if s' is any pole of Z(f,w;s) with w allowed, then\nexp(2\\pi is') is a monodromy eigenvalue of f; (2) the `standard' form is\nallowed; (3) every monodromy eigenvalue of f is obtained as in (1) for some\nallowed w and some s'.\n  For general (X,0) we prove (1) unconditionally, and (2)-(3) under an\nadditional (necessary) assumption, which generalizes the semigroup condition of\nNeumann-Wahl.

First, the composition of the effluent in air\nhas been recorded as a function of the distance to determine how fast air\nadmixes into the effluent. Then, the spatial distribution of atomic oxygen and\nozone in the effluent has been recorded in ambient air and compared to\nmeasurements in a helium atmosphere.

In ambient air, the O density declines only slightly faster with\nthe distance compared to a helium atmosphere. On the contrary, the O3 density\nin ambient air increases significantly faster with the distance compared to a\nhelium atmosphere. This mysterious behavior can have big implication for the\nuse of similar jets in plasma medicine. It is shown that photodissociation of\nO2 and O3 is not responsible for the observed effect.

While the Sun has been the subject of intense research for\nrefining dynamo models, observations of magnetic cyclic activity in solar type\nstars have become more and more available, opening a new path to understand the\nunderlying physics behind stellar cycles. For instance, it is key to understand\nhow stellar rotation rate influences magnetic cycle period $\\Pcyc$. Recent\nnumerical simulations of advection-dominated Babcock Leighton models have\ndemonstrated that it is difficult to explain this observed trend given a) the\nstrong influence of the cycle period to the meridional circulation amplitude\nand b) the fact that 3D models indicate that meridional flows become weaker as\nthe rotation rate increases. In this paper, we introduce the turbulent pumping\nmechanism as another advective process capable also of transporting the\nmagnetic fields. We found that this model is now able to reproduce the\nobservations under the assumption that this effect increases as $\\Omega^2$. The\nturbulent pumping becomes indeed another major player able to circumvent the\nmeridional circulation. However, for high rotation rates ($\\Omega \\simeq 5\n\\Omega_\\odot$), its effects dominate those of the meridional circulation,\nentering a new class of regime dominated by the advection of turbulent pumping\nand thus leading to a cyclic activity qualitatively different from that of the\nsun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 15:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
