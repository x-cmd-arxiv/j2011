This time scale is extracted\nfrom the space-time measurement of the deformation of the plate by studying the\ntemporal dynamics of wavelet coefficients of the turbulent field. The central\nhypothesis of the theory is the time scale separation between dissipative time\nscale, nonlinear time scale and the period of the wave ($T_d>>T_{NL}>>T$). We\nobserve that this scale separation is valid in our system. The discrete modes\ndue to the finite size effects are responsible for the disagreement between\nobservations and theory. A crossover from continuous weak turbulence and\ndiscrete turbulence is observed when the nonlinear time scale is of the same\norder of magnitude as the frequency separation of the discrete modes. The\nKolmogorov-Zakharov energy cascade is then strongly altered and is frozen\nbefore reaching the dissipative regime expected in the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 16:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

One of the possibilities considered is that the\nsmall Fermi surface pockets observed at high magnetic fields can be understood\nin terms of Fermi surface reconstruction by a form of small wavevector charge\norder, observed over long lengthscales in experiments such as nuclear magnetic\nresonance and x-ray scattering, potentially accompanied by an additional\nmechanism to gap the antinodal density of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 18:40:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 00:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-20"}

After reviewing the scaling\napproach and Ginzburg-Landau theory for critical phenomena, Wilson's momentum\nshell RG method is presented, and the critical exponents for the scalar Phi^4\nmodel are determined to first order in an eps expansion about d_c = 4.\nSubsequently, the technically more versatile field-theoretic formulation of the\nperturbational RG for static critical phenomena is described. It is explained\nhow the emergence of scale invariance connects UV divergences to IR\nsingularities, and the RG equation is employed to compute the critical\nexponents for the O(n)-symmetric Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory. The second part\nis devoted to field theory representations of non-linear stochastic dynamical\nsystems, and the application of RG tools to critical dynamics. Dynamic critical\nphenomena in systems near equilibrium are efficiently captured through Langevin\nequations, and their mapping onto the Janssen-De Dominicis response functional,\nexemplified by the purely relaxational models with non-conserved (model A) /\nconserved order parameter (model B). The Langevin description and scaling\nexponents for isotropic ferromagnets (model J) and for driven diffusive\nnon-equilibrium systems are also discussed. Finally, an outlook is presented to\nscale-invariant phenomena and non-equilibrium phase transitions in interacting\nparticle systems. It is shown how the stochastic master equation associated\nwith chemical reactions or population dynamics models can be mapped onto\nimaginary-time, non-Hermitian `quantum' mechanics. In the continuum limit, this\nDoi-Peliti Hamiltonian is represented through a coherent-state path integral,\nwhich allows an RG analysis of diffusion-limited annihilation processes and\nphase transitions from active to inactive, absorbing states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 18:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Estimating the\ncovariance matrix that describes these systems is a difficult problem due to a\nnumber of factors such as poor sample sizes and measurement errors.

A floorplan is HFO-$k$ if it can be obtained by\nstarting with a single rectangle and recursively embedding mosaic floorplans of\nat most $k$ rooms inside the rooms of intermediate floorplans. When $k=2$ this\nis exactly the class of slicing floorplans as the only distinct floorplans with\ntwo rooms are a room with a vertical slice and a room with a horizontal slice\nrespectdeively.

LLAGN are of great interest because these objects are the\nmost common among active galaxies, especially in the nearby universe. Studying\nthem in great detail makes it possible to investigate the AGN evolution over\ncosmic timescale. Indeed, many LLAGN likely represent the final stage of an\nAGN's lifetime.

By using scaled Spitzer/IRS spectra of typical\nstarburst galaxies, we show that the star formation contribution to the 12\nmicron emission is minor in the central parsecs of most LLAGN. Therefore, the\nobserved MIR emission in the VISIR and Michelle data is most likely emitted by\nthe AGN itself, which, for higher luminosity AGN, is interpreted as thermal\nemission from a dusty torus. Furthermore, the 12 micron emission of the LLAGN\nis strongly correlated with the absorption corrected 2-10 keV luminosity and\nthe MIR--X-ray correlation found previously for AGN is extended to a range from\n10^40 to 10^45 erg/s.

This instability induces large-scale non spherical\noscillations of the shock, which have crucial consequences on the dynamics and\nthe geometry of the explosion. While the existence of this instability has been\nfirmly established, its physical origin remains somewhat uncertain. Two\nmechanisms have indeed been proposed to explain its linear growth. The first is\nan advective-acoustic cycle, where the instability results from the interplay\nbetween advected perturbations (entropy and vorticity) and an acoustic wave.\nThe second mechanism is purely acoustic and assumes that the shock is able to\namplify trapped acoustic waves. Several arguments favouring the\nadvective-acoustic cycle have already been proposed, however none was entirely\nconclusive for realistic flow parameters. In this article we give two new\narguments which unambiguously show that the instability is not purely acoustic,\nand should be attributed to the advective-acoustic cycle. First, we extract a\nradial propagation timescale by comparing the frequencies of several unstable\nharmonics that differ only by their radial structure. The extracted time\nmatches the advective-acoustic time but strongly disagrees with a purely\nacoustic interpretation. Second, we present a method to compute purely acoustic\nmodes, by artificially removing advected perturbations below the shock. All\nthese purely acoustic modes are found to be stable, showing that the advected\nwave is essential to the instability mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 21:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The\ndetection rate of 21-cm absorption seems to be higher for systems with higher\nN(HI) or metallicity. However, no clear correlation is found between the\nintegrated 21-cm optical depth (or spin temperature) and either N(HI),\nmetallicity or velocity spread of the low ionization species. There are 13 DLAs\nin our sample for which high resolution optical spectra covering the expected\nwavelength range of H_2 absorption are available. We report the detection of\nH_2 molecules in the z_abs = 3.3871 21-cm absorber towards J0203+1134 (PKS\n0201+113). In 8 cases, neither H_2 nor 21-cm absorption are detected. The lack\nof 21-cm and H_2 absorption in these systems can be explained if most of the HI\nin these DLAs originate from low density high temperature gas. In one case we\nhave a DLA with 21-cm absorption not showing H_2 absorption. In two cases, both\nspecies are detected but do not originate from the same velocity component. In\nthe remaining 2 cases 21-cm absorption is not detected despite the presence of\nH_2 with evidence for the presence of cold gas. All this is consistent with the\nidea that the H_2 components seen in DLAs are compact (with sizes of < 15 pc)\nand contain only a small fraction (i.e typically <10%) of the total N(HI)\nmeasured in the DLAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2011 22:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of a particular class of\ncomplex spaces, whose structure allows us to give a structure theorem for\ncurrents, solve the Cauchy-Riemann equation and characterize holomorphic\ncurrents. In Section 5, we introduce the concept of bidimension of (global)\nmetric currents on a Banach space and relate it to the behaviour of the finite\ndimensional projections of the currents.

Thus, if one wishes to entertain the possibility of Lorentz symmetry\nbreaking within the context of the class of local physical theories, then it\nseems likely that one will have to abandon (or at the very least grossly\nmodify) the relativity principle. Working within the framework of local\nphysics, we reassess the notion of spacetime transformations between inertial\nframes in the absence of the relativity principle, arguing that significant and\nnontrivial physics can still be extracted as long as the transformations are at\nleast linear. An interesting technical aspect of the analysis is that the\ntransformations now form a groupoid/pseudo-group --- it is this technical point\nthat permits one to evade the von Ignatowsky argument. Even in the absence of a\nrelativity principle we can nevertheless deduce clear and compelling rules for\nthe transformation of space and time, rules for the composition of\n3-velocities, and rules for the transformation of energy and momentum. As part\nof the analysis we identify two particularly elegant and physically compelling\nmodels implementing \"minimalist\" violations of Lorentz invariance --- in the\nfirst of these minimalist models all Lorentz violations are confined to\ncarefully delineated particle physics sub-sectors, while the second minimalist\nLorentz-violating model depends on one free function of absolute velocity, but\notherwise preserves as much as possible of standard Lorentz invariant physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 03:34:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 01:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2012 19:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Since our task is to minimize\nthe number of repeaters, a natural idea is enlarging coverage area. However,\ncoverage has restrictions. First, service area has to be divided economically\nas repeater's coverage is limited. In this paper, our fundamental method is to\nadopt seamless cellular network division. Second, underlying physics content in\nfrequency distribution problem is interference between two close frequencies.\nConsequently, we choose a proper frequency width of 0.1MHz and a relevantly\nreliable setting to apply one frequency several times.\n  We make a few general assumptions to simplify real situation. For instance,\nimmobile users yield to homogenous distribution; repeaters can receive and\ntransmit information in any given frequency in duplex operation; coverage is\nmainly decided by antenna height.\n  Two models are built up to solve 1000 users and 10000 users situations\nrespectively. In order to utilize restricted frequency and PL code, three\nstratified terms - \"cell\", \"cluster\", \"group\" - are introduced to describe the\nmodels in detail. Under our analysis, 91 repeaters for 1000 users and 469\nrepeaters for 10000 users are viable results.\n  Next, to test stability and sensitivity of models, we give total\nconsideration to the variation of sum of users, antenna height, and frequency\nwidth and service radius. Evaluation about models is offered qualitatively.\nFinally, two practical cases are put forward to gain a partial knowledge of\nmountainous area. The brief method in dealing with mountains is classified\ndiscussion in two ideal conditions.

This is\nparticularly useful in forensic imaging, where the extraction of minute details\nin an image can help to solve a crime. Super-resolution image restoration has\nbeen one of the most important research areas in recent years which goals to\nobtain a high resolution (HR) image from several low resolutions (LR) blurred,\nnoisy, under sampled and displaced images. Relation of the HR image and LR\nimages can be modeled by a linear system using a transformation matrix and\nadditive noise. However, a unique solution may not be available because of the\nsingularity of transformation matrix. To overcome this problem, POCS method has\nbeen used. However, their performance is not good because the effect of noise\nenergy has been ignored. In this paper, we propose an adaptive regularization\napproach based on the fact that the regularization parameter should be a linear\nfunction of noise variance.

A diffusion term is introduced into\nLSE, resulting in a RD-LSE equation, to which a piecewise constant solution can\nbe derived. In order to have a stable numerical solution of the RD based LSE,\nwe propose a two-step splitting method (TSSM) to iteratively solve the RD-LSE\nequation: first iterating the LSE equation, and then solving the diffusion\nequation. The second step regularizes the level set function obtained in the\nfirst step to ensure stability, and thus the complex and costly\nre-initialization procedure is completely eliminated from LSE. By successfully\napplying diffusion to LSE, the RD-LSE model is stable by means of the simple\nfinite difference method, which is very easy to implement. The proposed RD\nmethod can be generalized to solve the LSE for both variational level set\nmethod and PDE-based level set method. The RD-LSE method shows very good\nperformance on boundary anti-leakage, and it can be readily extended to high\ndimensional level set method. The extensive and promising experimental results\non synthetic and real images validate the effectiveness of the proposed RD-LSE\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 08:16:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 01:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 01:28:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

Determining the mass transfer in a close binary system is of prime\nimportance for understanding its evolution. SS Leporis, a symbiotic star\nshowing the Algol paradox and presenting clear evidence of ongoing mass\ntransfer, in which the donor has been thought to fill its Roche lobe, is a\ntarget particularly suited to this kind of study. Aims. Since previous\nspectroscopic and interferometric observations have not been able to fully\nconstrain the system morphology and characteristics, we go one step further to\ndetermine its orbital parameters, for which we need new interferometric\nobservations directly probing the inner parts of the system with a much higher\nnumber of spatial frequencies. Methods. We use data obtained at eight different\nepochs with the VLTI instruments AMBER and PIONIER in the H- and K-bands. We\nperformed aperture synthesis imaging to obtain the first model-independent view\nof this system. We then modelled it as a binary (whose giant is spatially\nresolved) that is surrounded by a circumbinary disc. Results. Combining these\ninterferometric measurements with previous radial velocities, we fully\nconstrain the orbit of the system. We then determine the mass of each star and\nsignificantly revise the mass ratio. The M giant also appears to be almost\ntwice smaller than previously thought. Additionally, the low spectral\nresolution of the data allows the flux of both stars and of the dusty disc to\nbe determined along the H and K bands, and thereby extracting their\ntemperatures. Conclusions. We find that the M giant actually does not stricto\nsensus fill its Roche lobe. The mass transfer is more likely to occur through\nthe accretion of an important part of the giant wind. We finally rise the\npossibility for an enhanced mass loss from the giant, and we show that an\naccretion disc should have formed around the A star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 10:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Consequently, the estimation and comparison of treatment effects based\non the empirical distribution of the responses can be biased since the units\nexposed to the various treatments could differ in important unknown\npretreatment characteristics, which are related to the response. An important\nexample studied in this article is the question of whether private schools\noffer better quality of education than public schools. In order to address this\nquestion, we use data collected in the year 2000 by OECD for the Programme for\nInternational Student Assessment (PISA). Focusing for illustration on scores in\nmathematics of 15-year-old pupils in Ireland, we find that the raw average\nscore of pupils in private schools is higher than of pupils in public schools.\nHowever, application of a newly proposed method for observational studies\nsuggests that the less able pupils tend to enroll in public schools, such that\ntheir lower scores are not necessarily an indication of bad quality of the\npublic schools. Indeed, when comparing the average score in the two types of\nschools after adjusting for the enrollment effects, we find quite surprisingly\nthat public schools perform better on average.

We have\npreviously reported an anti-correlation with EW\\proptoL(2-10 keV)^-0.22 in a\nHEG sample, and the correlation is much weaker after averaging multiple\nobservations of individual AGNs (EW\\proptoL(2-10 keV)^-0.13). This indicates\nthat rapid variation in X-ray continuum plays an important role in producing\nthe XBE, and such an effect should also be visible in individual AGNs. In this\npaper, by normalizing the line EWs and continuum luminosities to the\ntime-averaged values for each AGN in our sample with multiple HEG observations,\nwe find a strong anti-correlation between EW and Lx (EW/<EW>\\propto\n(L/<L>)^-0.82+/-0.10), consistent with the XBE expected in an individual AGN if\nthe narrow line flux remains constant while the continuum varies. This is first\nobservational evidence that the Fe K{\\alpha} line flux in a large sample of\nAGNs lacks of a corresponding response to the continuum variation, supporting\nthat the narrow Fe-K line emission originates from a region far from the\nnucleus. We then performed Monte-Carlo simulations to address whether the\nglobal XBE can be produced by X-ray continuum variation solely, and found that\nsuch interpretation of XBE cannot be ruled out statistically. One thus should\nbe very cautious before reaching any scientific conclusion based on an observed\nXBE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 14:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The results are analyzed in terms of the classical analyticity strip\nmethod and Beale, Kato and Majda (BKM) theorem. A well-resolved acceleration of\nthe time-decay of the width of the analyticity strip $\\delta(t)$ is observed at\nthe highest resolution for $3.7<t<3.85$ while preliminary 3D visualizations\nshow the collision of vortex sheets. The BKM criterium on the power-law growth\nof supremum of the vorticity, applied on the same time-interval, is not\ninconsistent with the occurrence of a singularity around $t \\simeq 4$.\n  These new findings lead us to investigate how fast the analyticity strip\nwidth needs to decrease to zero in order to sustain a finite-time singularity\nconsistent with the BKM theorem. A new simple bound of the supremum norm of\nvorticity in terms of the energy spectrum is introduced and used to combine the\nBKM theorem with the analyticity-strip method. It is shown that a finite-time\nblowup can exist only if $\\delta(t)$ vanishes sufficiently fast at the\nsingularity time. In particular, if a power law is assumed for $\\delta(t)$ then\nits exponent must be greater than some critical value, thus providing a new\ntest that is applied to our $4096^3$ Taylor-Green numerical simulation.\n  Our main conclusion is that the numerical results are not inconsistent with a\nsingularity but that higher-resolution studies are needed to extend the\ntime-interval on which a well-resolved power-law behavior of $\\delta(t)$ takes\nplace, and check whether the new regime is genuine and not simply a crossover\nto a faster exponential decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 14:13:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 17:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-17"}

Furthermore, the cross-correlation study indicates that\nthe rotational cycle length of the two hemispheres has different phases, and\nthe rotational cycle length of the whole disk as well as the northern and\nsouthern hemispheres also has phase shifts with the corresponding solar\nactivity. What's more, the temporal variation of North-South (N-S) asymmetry of\nthe rotational cycle length is also studied; it displays the same variation\ntrend as the N-S asymmetry of solar activity in a solar cycle as well as in the\nconsidered time interval, and it has two significant periods of 7.7 and 17.5\nyears.

The protocol employs two\nphases: Multiple Access (MA) phase and Broadcast (BC) phase with each phase\nutilizing one channel use. For the two-way relaying scenario, it was observed\nby Koike-Akino et al. \\cite{KPT}, that adaptively changing the network coding\nmap used at the relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the\nimpact of multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA\nphase and all these network coding maps should satisfy a requirement called\n\\textit{exclusive law}. This paper does the equivalent for the three-way\nrelaying scenario. We show that when the three users transmit points from the\nsame 4-PSK constellation, every such network coding map that satisfies the\nexclusive law can be represented by a Latin Cube of Second Order. The network\ncode map used by the relay for the BC phase is explicitly obtained and is aimed\nat reducing the effect of interference at the MA stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 14:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 18:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 13:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Horizontal proper motions were derived\nfrom G-band and Ca II H images, whereas line-of-sight velocities were extracted\nfrom VTT Echelle H-alpha 656.28 nm spectra and Fe I 630.25 nm spectral data of\nthe Hinode/Spectro-Polarimeter, which also provided three-dimensional magnetic\nfield information.

In one of the trailing sunspots of\nactive region NOAA 11126, we observed moat flow and moving magnetic features\n(MMFs), even after its penumbra had decayed. We also noticed a superpenumbral\nstructure around this pore. MMFs follow well-defined, radial paths from the\nspot all the way to the border of a supergranular cell surrounding the spot. In\ncontrast, flux emergence near the other sunspot prevented it from establishing\nsuch well ordered flow patterns, which could even be observed around a tiny\npore of just 2 Mm diameter. After the disappearance of the sunspots/pores a\ncoherent patch of abnormal granulation remained at their location, which was\ncharacterized by more uniform horizontal proper motions, low divergence values,\nand diminished photospheric Doppler velocities. This region, thus, differs\nsignificantly from granulation and other areas covered by G-band bright points.\nWe conclude that this peculiar flow pattern is a signature of sunspot decay and\nthe dispersal of magnetic flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 15:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In\nthis paper, another class of rate-1/2 codes is constructed for all $n$ in which\ncase the decoding delay is half the decoding delay of the rate-1/2 codes given\nby Tarokh et al. This is achieved by giving first a general construction of\nsquare real orthogonal designs which includes as special cases the well-known\nconstructions of Adams, Lax and Phillips and the construction of Geramita and\nPullman, and then making use of it to obtain the desired rate-1/2 codes. For\nthe case of 9 transmit antennas, the proposed rate-1/2 code is shown to be of\nminimal-delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 15:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-08"}

We\ncompute model density functions of close-in exoplanets in the orbital\nsemi-major axis - stellar mass plane to represent planet migration that is\nhalted via several mechanisms, including the interior 1:2 resonance with the\nmagnetospheric disk truncation radius, the interior 1:2 resonance with the dust\nsublimation radius, and several scenarios for tidal halting. The models differ\nin the predicted power law dependence of the exoplanet orbital semi-major axis\nas a function stellar mass, and thus we also include a power law model with the\nexponent as a free parameter. We use a Bayesian analysis to assess the model\nsuccess in reproducing empirical distributions of confirmed exoplanets and\nKepler candidates that orbit interior to 0.1 AU. Our results confirm a\ncorrelation of the halting distance with stellar mass. Tidal halting provides\nthe best fit to the empirical distribution of confirmed Jovian exoplanets at a\nstatistically robust level, consistent with the Kozai mechanism and the\nspin-orbit misalignment of a substantial fraction of hot Jupiters. For Kepler\ncandidates, which have a more restricted range in stellar mass compared to\nconfirmed planets, we are unable to discern between the tidal dissipation and\nmagnetospheric disk truncation braking mechanisms at a statistically\nsignificant level. The power law model favors exponents in the range of\n0.38-0.9. This is larger than that predicted for tidal halting (0.23-0.33),\nwhich suggests that additional physics may be missing in the tidal halting\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 15:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2013 05:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We summarize\na scalar theory of gravity with a such \"ether\", which starts from a tentative\ninterpretation of gravity as a pressure force. The theory also admits that our\nphysical standards of space and time are affected by gravitation similarly as\nthey are affected by a uniform motion. General motion is governed by an\nextension of Newton's second law to the curved space-time which is thus\nobtained. Together with the scalar field equation of the theory, this leads to\na true conservation equation for the total energy. The law of motion also leads\nto an alternative 4-component equation governing the dynamics of a continuum in\nterms of its energy-momentum tensor. That new equation implies that mass\nconservation is obtained as a limiting behaviour for a weak and slowly varying\ngravitational field and/or at a low pressure. In the presence of the Lorentz\nforce field, the new dynamical equation gives the second group of the\ngravitationally-modified Maxwell equations in the investigated theory. This is\nconsistent with the geometrical optics of the theory as governed by the\nproposed extension of Newton's second law. The theory has the correct Newtonian\nlimit; it predicts Schwarzschild's exterior metric of general relativity and\ngeodesic motion in the static situation with spherical symmetry. A\npost-Newtonian approximation of this theory shows that no preferred-frame\neffect occurs for photons at the (first) post-Newtonian approximation. It is\nargued that the existence of preferred-frame effects in celestial mechanics,\ncomparable in magnitude with the \"relativistic\" effects, does not a priori\ninvalidate the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 10:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-09"}

The correlator of\nconjugate macroparameters, namely, the effective entropy and the effective\ntemperature, has been calculated. The correlator was found to be proportional\nto the effective action which characterizes the stochastic environment.
