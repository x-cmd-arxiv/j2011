In particular, we\nshow that the method, although being perturbative, can predict the expected\nquantum critical point, where the gap of low-energy spectrum vanishes, which is\nin good agreement with results of other numerical and Green's function\nanalyses.

The\nX-ray spectrum can be reproduced by a power-law model with a photon index of\nabout 2, and an X-ray flux of 2x10^{-13} erg s^-1 cm^-2. The ratio of the\ngamma-ray flux to the X-ray flux is about 10. If the origin of the TeV\ngamma-ray is inverse Compton scattering of microwave background by high energy\nelectrons, the ratio corresponds to the magnetic field strength of ~1 microG.\nHowever, the smaller size of the X-ray emission than that of the TeV emission\nsuggests that energy loss of the electrons can explain the large ratio of the\ngamma-ray flux with a reasonable magnetic field strength of a few microG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2011 07:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In practice one has to determine the orientation\nprobability density function f \\in L2(SO(3)) from Rf \\in L2(S2\\times S2) which\nis known only on a discrete set of points. Since one has only partial\ninformation about Rf the inversion of the Radon transform becomes an ill-posed\ninverse problem. Motivated by this problem we define a new notion of the Radon\ntransform Rf of functions f on general compact Lie groups and introduce two\napproximate inversion algorithms which utilize our previously developed\ngeneralized variational splines on manifolds. Our new algorithms fit very well\nto the application of Radon transform on SO(3) to texture analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2011 15:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 01:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}

The choice of upper mass\nbound is motivated by absence of direct experimental searches for singlet\nfermions with greater mass. We carried out computations at zero temperature and\nignored the background effects. Combining constraints of sufficient value of\nthe leptonic asymmetry for production of dark matter particles, condition for\nsterile neutrino to be out of thermal equilibrium and existing experimental\ndata we conclude that it can be satisfied only for mass of heavier sterile\nneutrino in the range 1.4 GeV < M < 2 Gev and only for the case of normal\nhierarchy for active neutrino mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2011 18:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 09:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-25"}
