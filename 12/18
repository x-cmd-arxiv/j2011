At the onset of star formation, radiation\nfrom massive stars heats the surrounding gas, which suppresses the formation of\nmany low-mass stars. When simulating pre-main-sequence stars, their stellar\nproperties must be defined by a prestellar model. Different approaches to\nprestellar modeling may yield quantitatively different results. In this paper,\nwe compare two existing prestellar models under identical initial conditions to\ngauge whether the choice of model has any significant effects on the final\npopulation of stars. The first model treats stellar radii and luminosities with\na ZAMS model, while separately estimating the accretion luminosity by\ninterpolating to published prestellar tracks. The second, more accurate\nprestellar model self-consistently evolves the radius and luminosity of each\nstar under highly variable accretion conditions. Each is coupled to a\nraytracing-based radiative feedback code that also treats ionization. The\nimpact of the self-consistent model is less ionizing radiation and less heating\nduring the early stages of star formation. This may affect final mass\ndistributions. We noted a peak stellar mass reduced by 8% from 47.3 Msun to\n43.5 Msun in the evolutionary model, relative to the track-fit model. Also, the\ndifference in mass between the two largest stars in each case is reduced from\n14 Msun to 7.5 Msun. The HII regions produced by these massive stars were also\nseen to flicker on timescales down to the limit imposed by our timestep (< 560\nyears), rapidly changing in size and shape, confirming previous cluster\nsimulations using ZAMS-based estimates for prestellar ionizing flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2011 16:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 20:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Alternative non-invasive\ntechniques such as optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance (ODNMR) so far\nproved difficult in semiconductor nano-structures due to significant\nstrain-induced quadrupole broadening of the NMR spectra.

We assume that each of the\nprocessors are Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) enabled such that they\ncan independently trade off performance for power, while taking the video\ndecoding workload into account. In the past, scheduling and DVFS policies in\nmulti-core systems have been formulated heuristically due to the inherent\ncomplexity of the on-line multicore scheduling problem. The key contribution of\nthis report is that we rigorously formulate the problem as a Markov decision\nprocess (MDP), which simultaneously takes into account the on-line scheduling\nand per-core DVFS capabilities; the power consumption of the processor cores\nand caches; and the loss tolerant and dynamic nature of the video decoder's\ntraffic. In particular, we model the video traffic using a Direct Acyclic Graph\n(DAG) to capture the precedence constraints among frames in a Group of Pictures\n(GOP) structure, while also accounting for the fact that frames have different\ndisplay/decoding deadlines and non-deterministic decoding complexities. The\nobjective of the MDP is to minimize long-term power consumption subject to a\nminimum Quality of Service (QoS) constraint related to the decoder's\nthroughput. Although MDPs notoriously suffer from the curse of dimensionality,\nwe show that, with appropriate simplifications and approximations, the\ncomplexity of the MDP can be mitigated. We implement a slice-parallel version\nof H.264 on a multiprocessor ARM (MPARM) virtual platform simulator, which\nprovides cycle-accurate and bus signal-accurate simulation for different\nprocessors.

This can be viewed as a secrecy problem,\nwhere we desire that the channel state itself be minimally leaked to Eve while\nbeing communicated to Bob. The paper is aimed at characterizing the trade-off\nregion between amplification and leakage rates for such a system. An achievable\ncoding scheme is presented, wherein the transmitter transmits a partial state\ninformation over the channel to facilitate the amplification process. For the\ncase when Bob observes a stronger signal than Eve, the achievable coding scheme\nis enhanced with secure refinement. Outer bounds on the trade-off region are\nalso derived, and used in characterizing some special case results. In\nparticular, the optimal amplification-leakage rate difference, called as\ndifferential amplification capacity, is characterized for the reversely\ndegraded discrete memoryless channel, the degraded binary, and the degraded\nGaussian channels. In addition, for the degraded Gaussian model, the extremal\ncorner points of the trade-off region are characterized, and the gap between\nthe outer bound and achievable rate-regions is shown to be less than half a bit\nfor a wide set of channel parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2011 21:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 02:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

Here $\\lambda_r$ is the $r$'th smallest generalized\neigenvalue of the Laplacian matrices of cost and demand graphs; $C(T,V\\setminus\nT)$ (resp. $D(T,V\\setminus T)$) is the weight of edges crossing the\n$(T,V\\setminus T)$ cut in cost (resp. demand) graph and $\\Phi^*$ is the\nsparsity of the optimal cut. In words, we show that the non-uniform sparsest\ncut problem is easy when the generalized spectrum grows moderately fast. To the\nbest of our knowledge, there were no results based on higher order spectra for\nnon-uniform sparsest cut prior to this work.\n  Even for uniform sparsest cut, the quantitative aspects of our result are\nsomewhat stronger than previous methods. Similar results hold for other\nexpansion measures like edge expansion, normalized cut, and conductance, with\nthe $r$'th smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian playing the role of\n$\\lambda_r$ in the latter two cases.\n  Our proof is based on an l1-embedding of vectors from a semi-definite program\nfrom the Lasserre hierarchy. The embedded vectors are then rounded to a cut\nusing standard threshold rounding. We hope that the ideas connecting\n$\\ell_1$-embeddings to Lasserre SDPs will find other applications. Another\naspect of the analysis is the adaptation of the column selection paradigm from\nour earlier work on rounding Lasserre SDPs [GS11] to pick a set of edges rather\nthan vertices. This feature is important in order to extend the algorithms to\nnon-uniform sparsest cut.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 02:41:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 21:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2012 05:09:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 22:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We start with a standard framework based\non the coalescent, a stochastic process that generates genealogies connecting\nrandomly sampled individuals from the population of interest. These genealogies\nserve as a glue between the population demographic history and genomic\nsequences. It turns out that only the times of genealogical lineage\ncoalescences contain information about population size dynamics. Viewing these\ncoalescent times as a point process, estimating population size trajectories is\nequivalent to estimating a conditional intensity of this point process.\nTherefore, our inverse problem is similar to estimating an inhomogeneous\nPoisson process intensity function. We demonstrate how recent advances in\nGaussian process-based nonparametric inference for Poisson processes can be\nextended to Bayesian nonparametric estimation of population size dynamics under\nthe coalescent. We compare our Gaussian process (GP) approach to one of the\nstate of the art Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) methods for estimating\npopulation trajectories.

However recently proposed Physical-layer\nNetwork Coding (PNC) and Analog Network Coding (ANC) has shown that it is\npossible to decode an unknown packet from the collision of two packet, when one\nof the colliding packet is known a priori. Taking advantage of such collision\ndecoding scheme, in this paper we propose a Joint Network Coding based\nCooperative Retransmission (JNC- CR) scheme, where we show that ANC along with\nDNC can offer a much higher retransmission gain than that attainable through\neither ANC, DNC or Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) based retransmission. This\nscheme can be applied for two wireless multicast groups interfering with each\nother. Because of the broadcast nature of the wireless transmission, receivers\nof different multicast group can opportunistically listen and cache packets\nfrom the interfering transmitter. These cached packets, along with the packets\nthe receiver receives from its transmitter can then be used for decoding the\nJNC packet. We validate the higher retransmission gain performance of JNC with\nan optimal DNC scheme, using simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 11:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

The first step\nin segmentation is to remove intrusive objects such as stain debris and other\nnoises. The next step is detection of touching and overlapping chromosomes, and\nthe final step is separation of such chromosomes. Common methods for separation\nbetween touching chromosomes are interactive and require human intervention for\ncorrect separation between touching and overlapping chromosomes. In this paper,\na geometric-based method is used for automatic detection of touching and\noverlapping chromosomes and separating them. The proposed scheme performs\nsegmentation in two phases. In the first phase, chromosome clusters are\ndetected using three geometric criteria, and in the second phase, chromosome\nclusters are separated using a cut-line. Most of earlier methods did not work\nproperly in case of chromosome clusters that contained more than two\nchromosomes. Our method, on the other hand, is quite efficient in separation of\nsuch chromosome clusters. At each step, one separation will be performed and\nthis algorithm is repeated until all individual chromosomes are separated.\nAnother important point about the proposed method is that it uses the geometric\nfeatures of chromosomes which are independent of the type of images and it can\neasily be applied to any type of images such as binary images and does not\nrequire multispectral images as well.

A key component of the data processing for Gaia is\nthe astrometric core solution, which must implement an efficient and accurate\nnumerical algorithm to solve the resulting, extremely large least-squares\nproblem. The Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) is a framework that\nallows to implement a range of different iterative solution schemes suitable\nfor a scanning astrometric satellite. In order to find a computationally\nefficient and numerically accurate iteration scheme for the astrometric\nsolution, compatible with the AGIS framework, we study an adaptation of the\nclassical conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm, and compare it to the so-called\nsimple iteration (SI) scheme that was previously known to converge for this\nproblem, although very slowly. The different schemes are implemented within a\nsoftware test bed for AGIS known as AGISLab, which allows to define, simulate\nand study scaled astrometric core solutions. After successful testing in\nAGISLab, the CG scheme has been implemented also in AGIS. The two algorithms CG\nand SI eventually converge to identical solutions, to within the numerical\nnoise (of the order of 0.00001 micro-arcsec). These solutions are independent\nof the starting values (initial star catalogue), and we conclude that they are\nequivalent to a rigorous least-squares estimation of the astrometric\nparameters. The CG scheme converges up to a factor four faster than SI in the\ntested cases, and in particular spatially correlated truncation errors are much\nmore efficiently damped out with the CG scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2011 15:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}
