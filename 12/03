With the lognormal\nprior using the Hamiltonian sampling technique and on scales of about 4 h^{-1}\nMpc we find that the over-dense regions are excellent reconstructed, however,\nunder-dense regions (void statistics) are quantitatively poorly recovered.\nContrary to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution which was shown to\nover-estimate the density in the under-dense regions we obtain lower densities\nthan in N-body simulations. This is due to the fact that the MAP solution is\nconservative whereas the full posterior yields samples which are consistent\nwith the prior statistics. The lognormal prior is not able to capture the full\nnon-linear regime at scales below ~ 10 h^{-1} Mpc for which higher order\ncorrelations would be required to describe the matter statistics.

Here we examine the sky variation at intermediate and high\nlatitudes using a cross-correlation technique. In particular, we compare the\nobserved emission in several large partitions of the sky plus 33 selected sky\nregions to three \"standard\" templates. The regions are selected using a\ncriterion based on the morphology of these template maps. The synchrotron\nemission shows evidence of steepening between GHz frequencies and the\n\\emph{WMAP} bands. There are indications of spectral index variations across\nthe sky but the current data are not precise enough to accurately quantify this\nfrom region-to-region. The emission correlated with the $H_{\\alpha}$ template\nshows clear evidence of deviation from a free-free spectrum. The emission can\nbe decomposed into a contribution from both free-free and spinning dust in the\nwarm ionised medium of the Galaxy. The derived free-free emissivity corresponds\nto a mean electron temperature of $\\sim 6000$ K, although the value depends\ncritically on the impact of dust absorption on the $H_{\\alpha}$ intensity. The\nWIM spinning dust emission has a peak emission in intensity in the range 40--50\nGHz.

It is\nclear that attempts to explain the emission by spinning dust models require\nmultiple components, which presumably relates to a complex mix of emission\nregions along a given line-of-sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 17:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-27"}

In this way, they generate a dense shell\nwhere the physical conditions for the formation of new stars are given. The aim\nof this study is to analyze the origin and evolution of the large HI shell\nGS100-02-41 and its role in triggering star forming processes.To characterize\nthe shell and its environs, we carry out a multi-wavelength study. We analyze\nhe HI 21 cm line, the radio continuum, and infrared emission distributions. The\nanalysis of the HI data shows an expanding shell structure centred at (l, b) =\n(100.6 deg, -2.04 deg) in the velocity range from -29 to -51.7 km/s.\n  We infer for GS100-02-41, a kinematical distance of 2.8 +/- 0.6 kpc. Several\nmassive stars belonging to Cep OB1 are located in projection within the large\nHI, shell boundaries. The analysis of the radio continuum and infrared data\nreveal that there is no continuum counterpart of the HI shell. On the other\nhand, three slightly extended radio continuum sources are observed in\nprojection onto the dense HI shell. From their flux density determinations we\ninfer that they are thermal in nature. An analysis of the HI emission\ndistribution in the environs of these sources shows, for each of them, a region\nof low emissivity having a good morphological correlation with the ionized gas\nin a velocity range similar to the one where GS100-02-41 is detected. The\norigin of GS100-02-41 could have been mainly due to the action of the Cep OB1\nmassive stars located inside the HI shell. The obtained age difference between\nthe HI shell and the HII regions, together with their relative location, led us\nto conclude that the ionizing stars could have been created as a consequence of\nthe shell evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 17:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The study of discrete X-ray sources is\nessential to our understanding of stellar evolution, dynamics, and end-products\nas well as accretion physics. With the subtraction of the discrete source\ncontributions, one can further map out truly diffuse X-ray emission, which can\nbe used to trace the feedback from active galactic nuclei, as well as from\nstars, both young and old, in the form of stellar winds and supernovae. The\nX-ray emission efficiency, however, is only about 1% of the energy input rate\nof the stellar feedback alone. The bulk of the feedback energy is most likely\ngone with outflows into large-scale galactic halos. Much is yet to be\ninvestigated to comprehend the role of such outflows in regulating the\necosystem, hence the evolution of galaxies. Even the mechanism of the diffuse\nX-ray emission remains quite uncertain. A substantial fraction of the emission\ncannot arise directly from optically-thin thermal plasma, as commonly assumed,\nand most likely originates in its charge exchange with neutral gas.

As the\npacking fraction of particles increases, particle motion becomes more\ncollective, leading to a growing length scale and scaling properties in the\nrheology as the material approaches the jamming transition. There is no\naccepted microscopic description of this phenomenon. However, in recent years\nit has been understood that the elasticity of simple amorphous solids is\ngoverned by a critical point, the unjamming transition where the pressure\nvanishes, and where elastic properties display scaling and a diverging length\nscale. The correspondence between these two transitions is at present unclear.\nHere we show that for a simple model of dense flow, which we argue captures the\nessential physics near the jamming threshold, a formal analogy can be made\nbetween the rheology of the flow and the elasticity of simple networks. This\nanalogy leads to a new conceptual framework to relate microscopic structure to\nrheology. It enables us to define and compute numerically normal modes and a\ndensity of states.

In this work we present a graph\npartitioning based approach for LNN synthesis with reduction in circuit cost.\nIn particular, the number of SWAP gates required to convert a given gate-level\nquantum circuit to its equivalent LNN configuration is minimized. Our algorithm\ndetermines the reordering of indices of the qubit line(s) for both single\ncontrol and multiple controlled gates.

We are able to measure the transit depths, eclipse\ndepths, thermal and ellipsoidal phase variations at both wavelengths. The large\namplitude phase variations, combined with the planet's previously-measured\nday-side spectral energy distribution, is indicative of non-zero Bond albedo\nand very poor day-night heat redistribution. The transit depths in the\nmid-infrared indicate that the atmospheric opacity is greater at 3.6 than at\n4.5 micron, in disagreement with model predictions, irrespective of C/O ratio.\nThe secondary eclipse depths are consistent with previous studies. We do not\ndetect ellipsoidal variations at 3.6 micron, but our parameter uncertainties\n-estimated via prayer-bead Monte Carlo- keep this non-detection consistent with\nmodel predictions. At 4.5 micron, on the other hand, we detect ellipsoidal\nvariations that are much stronger than predicted. If interpreted as a geometric\neffect due to the planet's elongated shape, these variations imply a 3:2 ratio\nfor the planet's longest:shortest axes and a relatively bright day-night\nterminator. If we instead presume that the 4.5 micron ellipsoidal variations\nare due to uncorrected systematic noise and we fix the amplitude of the\nvariations to zero, the best fit 4.5 micron transit depth becomes commensurate\nwith the 3.6 micron depth, within the uncertainties. The relative transit\ndepths are then consistent with a Solar composition and short scale height at\nthe terminator. Assuming zero ellipsoidal variations also yields a much deeper\n4.5 micron eclipse depth, consistent with a Solar composition and modest\ntemperature inversion.

This planet was\ndiscovered thanks to photometric data secured with the CoRoT satellite,\ncombined with spectroscopic radial velocity (RV) measurements. A photometric\nsearch for possible background eclipsing binaries conducted at CFHT and OGS\nconcluded with a very low risk of false positives. The usual techniques of\ncombining RV and transit data simultaneously were used to derive stellar and\nplanetary parameters. The planet has a mass of Mp = 2.8 \\pm 0.3 MJup, a radius\nof Rpl = 1.05 \\pm 0.13 RJup, a density of \\approx 3 g cm-3. RV data also\nclearly reveal a non zero eccentricity of e = 0.16 \\pm 0.02.

The age of the system is evaluated to be 7 Gyr, not far from the\ntransition to subgiant, in agreement with the rather large stellar radius. The\ntwo features of a significant eccentricity of the orbit and of a fairly high\ndensity are fairly uncommon for a hot Jupiter. The high density is, however,\nconsistent with a model of contraction of a planet at this mass, given the age\nof the system. On the other hand, at such an age, circularization is expected\nto be completed. In fact, we show that for this planetary mass and orbital\ndistance, any initial eccentricity should not totally vanish after 7 Gyr, as\nlong as the tidal quality factor Qp is more than a few 105, a value that is the\nlower bound of the usually expected range. Even if Corot-23b features a density\nand an eccentricity that are atypical of a hot Jupiter, it is thus not an\nenigmatic object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2011 21:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We point out that the existing PSG classification is\nincomplete; upon completing it, we find spin liquid states with S=1 and S=0\nMajorana fermion excitations coupled to a deconfined Z2 gauge field. The\ncrucial observation leading us to this result is that, like space group and\ntime reversal symmetries, spin rotations can act projectively on the fermionic\npartons; that is, a spin rotation may be realized by simultaneous SU(2) spin\nand gauge rotations. We show that there are only two realizations of spin\nrotations acting on fermionic partons: the familiar naive realization where\nspin rotation is not accompanied by any gauge transformation, and a single type\nof projective realization. We discuss the PSG classification for states with\nprojective spin rotations. To illustrate these results, we show that there are\nfour such PSGs on the two-dimensional square lattice.

In this\ntalk I discuss the challenge of computing these observables from first\nprinciples; i.e., quantum chromodynamics, itself. A key step is the\ndetermination of the frame-independent light-front wavefunctions (LFWFs) of\nhadrons -- the QCD eigensolutions which are analogs of the Schrodinger\nwavefunctions of atomic physics. The lensing effects of initial-state and\nfinal-state interactions, acting on LFWFs with different orbital angular\nmomentum, lead to the T-odd transversity observables such as the Sivers,\nCollins, and Boer-Mulders distributions. The lensing effect also leads to\nleading-twist phenomena which break leading-twist factorization, such as the\nbreakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions. A similar\nrescattering mechanism also leads to diffractive deep inelastic scattering, as\nwell as nuclear shadowing and non-universal antishadowing. It is thus important\nto distinguish \"static\" structure functions, the probability distributions\ncomputed from the target hadron's light-front wavefunctions, versus \"dynamical\"\nstructure functions which include the effects of initial- and final-state\nrescattering. I also discuss related effects, such as the J=0 fixed pole\ncontribution which appears in the real part of the virtual Compton amplitude.\nAdS/QCD, together with \"Light-Front Holography\", provides a simple\nLorentz-invariant color-confining approximation to QCD which is successful in\naccounting for light-quark meson and baryon spectroscopy as well as hadronic\nLFWFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2011 07:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 06:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

In the case of pure states, we show\nthat commutativity of the set of observables that define the estimation problem\nimplies the sufficiency of unentangled measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2011 09:35:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 2014 07:07:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 23:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-30"}

While a consensus has emerged that changes of the synapse\nstrength are crucial to neuronal computations, their modes of expression in\nvivo remain unclear. Recent experimental studies have reported that glial\ncells, particularly astrocytes in the hippocampus, are able to modulate\nshort-term plasticity but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here,\nwe investigate the characteristics of short-term plasticity modulation by\nastrocytes using a biophysically realistic computational model. Mean-field\nanalysis of the model unravels that astrocytes may mediate counterintuitive\neffects. Depending on the expressed presynaptic signaling pathways, astrocytes\nmay globally inhibit or potentiate the synapse: the amount of released\nneurotransmitter in the presence of the astrocyte is transiently smaller or\nlarger than in its absence. But this global effect usually coexists with the\nopposite local effect on paired pulses: with release-decreasing astrocytes most\npaired pulses become facilitated, while paired-pulse depression becomes\nprominent under release-increasing astrocytes. Moreover, we show that the\nfrequency of astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ oscillations controls the effects of\nthe astrocyte on short-term synaptic plasticity. Our model explains several\nexperimental observations yet unsolved, and uncovers astrocytic\ngliotransmission as a possible transient switch between short-term paired-pulse\ndepression and facilitation. This possibility has deep implications on the\nprocessing of neuronal spikes and resulting information transfer at synapses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2011 09:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}

A large statistical set is obtained in which dynamics (total\nvelocities and accelerations), shapes (lengths and widths), trajectories\n(angles of fall) and thermodynamic properties (temperatures) of the\ncondensations are derived. Specifically, we find that coronal rain is composed\nof small and dense chromospheric cores with average widths and lengths of 310\nkm and 710 km respectively, average temperatures below 7000 K, displaying a\nbroad distribution of falling speeds with an average of 70 km/s and\naccelerations largely below the effective gravity along loops.

We further find that the cooling in neighboring strands\noccurs simultaneously in general suggesting a similar thermodynamic evolution\namong strands, which can be explained by a common footpoint heating process.\nConstraints for coronal heating models of loops are thus provided.

The contribution of the paper to sparsity-aware\nonline learning is threefold; first, a Generalized Thresholding (GT) operator,\nwhich relates to both convex and non-convex penalty functions, is introduced.\nThis operator embodies, in a unified way, the majority of well-known\nthresholding rules which promote sparsity. Second, a non-convexly constrained,\nsparsity-promoting, online learning scheme, namely the Adaptive\nProjection-based Generalized Thresholding (APGT), is developed that\nincorporates the GT operator with a computational complexity that scales\nlinearly to the number of unknowns. Third, the novel family of partially\nquasi-nonexpansive mappings is introduced as a functional analytic tool for\ntreating the GT operator. By building upon the rich fixed point theory, the\nprevious class of mappings helps us, also, to establish a link between the GT\noperator and a union of linear subspaces; a non-convex object which lies at the\nheart of any sparsity promoting technique, batch or online. Based on such a\nfunctional analytic framework, a convergence analysis of the APGT is provided.\nFurthermore, extensive experiments suggest that the APGT exhibits competitive\nperformance when compared to computationally more demanding alternatives, such\nas the sparsity-promoting Affine Projection Algorithm (APA)- and Recursive\nLeast Squares (RLS)-based techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2011 15:12:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2011 16:12:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 00:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-03"}
