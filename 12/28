The detection and measurement of gravitational-waves from coalescing\nneutron-star binary systems is an important science goal for ground-based\ngravitational-wave detectors.

A joint detection of the\ngravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals would provide a powerful new\nprobe for astronomy.\n  Methods. During the period between September 19 and October 20, 2010, the\nfirst low-latency search for gravitational-waves from binary inspirals in LIGO\nand Virgo data was conducted.

This event is following other recent IPOs in the world of social\nnetworking companies, such as Groupon, Linkedin or Pandora to cite a few. With\na valuation close to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga has\nbecome the biggest web IPO since Google. This recent enthusiasm for social\nnetworking companies, and in particular Zynga, brings up the question whether\nor not they are overvalued. The common denominator of all these IPOs is that a\nlot of estimates about their valuation have been circulating, without any\nspecifics given about the methodology or assumptions used to obtain those\nnumbers. To bring more substance to the debate, we propose a two-tiered\napproach. First, we introduce a new model to forecast the global user base of\nZynga, based on the analysis of the individual dynamics of its major games.\nNext, we model the revenues per user using a logistic growth function, a\nstandard model for growth in competition. This leads to bracket the valuation\nof Zynga using three different scenarios (base one, optimistic and very\noptimistic): 4.17 billion USD in the base case, 5.16 billion in the high growth\nand 7.02 billion in the extreme growth scenario respectively. Thus, only the\nunlikely extreme growth scenario could potentially justify today's 6.6 billion\nUSD valuation of Zynga. This suggests that Zynga at its IPO has been\noverpriced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2011 21:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-30"}

When averaged over photometrical redshifts\n0.8<z_phot<2.2 the 2pCF of photometrically selected quasars is found to be\napproximated well with the power law w(\\theta)=(\\theta/\\theta_0)^{-\\alpha} with\n\\theta_0=4\".5+/-1\".4, \\alpha=0.94+/-0.06 over the range 1'<\\theta<40'.

Comparison\nof our results with studies of the X-ray selected AGNs with similar z shows\nthat the clustering amplitude of optically selected quasars is similar to that\nof X-ray selected quasars, but lower than that of samples of all X-ray selected\nAGNs.

Nuclear rings shrink in size with\nincreasing c_s, but are independent of M_BH, suggesting that ring position is\nnot determined by the Lindblad resonances.

More precisely, we study operators of the form P := D+ V,\nwhere D is a Dirac operators and V is an unbounded potential at infinity on a\npossibly non-compact manifold M_0. We assume that M_0 is a Lie manifold with\ncompactification denoted M. Examples of Lie manifolds are provided by\nasymptotically Euclidean or asymptotically hyperbolic spaces. The potential V\nis required to be invertible outside a compact set K and V^{-1} extends to a\nsmooth function on M\\K that vanishes on all faces of M in a controlled way.\nUsing tools from analysis on non-compact Riemannian manifolds, we show that the\ncomputation of the index of P reduces to the computation of the index of an\nelliptic pseudodifferential operator of order zero on M_0 that is a\nmultiplication operator at infinity. The index formula for P can then be\nobtained from earlier results. The proof also yields similar index formulas for\nCallias-type pseudodifferential operators coupled with bounded potentials that\nare invertible at infinity on asymptotically commutative Lie manifolds, a class\nof manifolds that includes the scattering and double-edge calculi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 04:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-30"}

Phonon frequencies\ncalculated using the ab-initio and empirical potential model are in excellent\nagreement with the reported experimental data. Further, volume dependence of\nphonon dispersion relation has been calculated, which indicates softening of\nzone boundary transverse acoustic phonon mode along [110] at volume\ncorresponding to the superionic transition in Li2O. The instability of phonon\nmode could be a precursor leading to the dynamical disorder of the lithium sub\nlattice. Empirical potential model calculations have been carried out to deduce\nthe probable direction of lithium diffusion by constructing a super cell\nconsisting of 12000 atoms. The barrier energy for lithium ion diffusion from\none lattice site to another at ambient and elevated temperature has been\ncomputed. Barrier energy considerations along various symmetry directions\nindicate that [001] is the most favourable direction for lithium diffusion in\nthe fast ion phase. This result corroborates our observation of dynamical\ninstability in the transverse mode along (110) wave vector. Using molecular\ndynamics simulations we have studied the temperature variation of elastic\nconstants, which are important to the high-temperature stability of lithium\noxide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 11:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-04"}

Unfortunately,\nit is extremely challenging to generate giant cross-Kerr nonlinearities. In\nrecent years, much effort has been made to perform multiqubit gates via weak\nXKNLs. However, the required nonlinearity strengths are still difficult to\nachieve in the experiment. We here propose an XKNL-based scheme for realizing a\ntwo-photon polarization-parity gate, a universal two-qubit gate, in which the\nrequired strength of the nonlinearity could be orders of magnitude weaker than\nthose required for previous schemes. The scheme utilizes a ring cavity fed by a\ncoherent state as a quantum information bus which interacts with a path mode of\nthe two polarized photons (qubits). The XKNL effect makes the bus pick up a\nphase shift dependent on the photon number of the path mode. Even when the\npotential phase shifts are very small they can be effectively measured using\nphoton-number resolving detectors, which accounts for the fact that our scheme\ncan work in the regime of tiny XKNL.

From the Mn 2$p$$\\rightarrow3d$ XMCD\nresults, it is shown that, while XMCD signals only due to paramagnetic\nMn$^{2+}$ ions were observed in ZnO:Mn, nonmagnetic, paramagnetic and\nferromagnetic Mn$^{2+}$ ions coexist in ZnO:Mn,N. XMCD signals of ZnO:Mn,N\nrevealed that the localized Mn$^{2+}$ ground state and Mn$^{2+}$ state\nhybridized with ligand hole coexisted, implying $p$-$d$ exchange coupling. In\nthe valence-band spectra, spectral weight near the Fermi level was suppressed,\nsuggesting that interaction between magnetic moments in ZnO:Mn,N has localized\nnature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 05:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}
