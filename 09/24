We use this sample to investigate the\napparent excess of submillimetre source counts in the direction of cluster\nfields compared to blank fields. The sample consists of three galaxy clusters\nthat exhibit multiple optical arcs due to strong gravitational lensing, and a\ncontrol group of four clusters with no apparent strong lensing. A tentative\nexcess of 2.7-sigma is seen in the number density of submillimetre luminous\ngalaxies (SMGs) within the lensing cluster fields compared to that in the\ncontrol group. Ancillary observations at radio, mid-infrared, optical, and\nX-ray wavelengths allow for the identification of counterparts to many of the\nSMGs. Utilizing photometric redshifts, we conclude that at least three of the\ngalaxies within the lensing fields have redshifts consistent with the clusters\nand implied infrared luminosities of ~10^12 Lsol. The existence of SMG cluster\nmembers may therefore be boosting source counts in the lensing cluster fields,\nwhich might be an effect of the dynamical state of those clusters. However, we\nfind that the removal of potential cluster members from the counts analysis\ndoes not entirely eliminate the difference between the cluster samples.

In light of the recent results from LHC the triviality bound in\nthe SM3 has now become obsolete, and the stability bound implies for a Higgs\nmass of e.g. mH=115 GeV the onset of new physics before 650 TeV, whereas there\nare no limits for mH>133 GeV. For the SM4, the stability and triviality curves\nintersect and bound a finite region. As a consequence, the fourth generation\nfermions place stringent theoretical limits on the Higgs mass, and there is a\nmaximal scale beyond which the theory cannot be perturbatively valid. We find\nthat the Higgs mass cannot exceed 700 GeV for any values of the fourth\ngeneration fermion masses. Turning the argument around, the absence of a Higgs\nsignal for mH<600 GeV excludes a fourth generation with quark masses below 300\nGeV and lepton masses below 350 GeV. In particular, the quark bounds also hold\nfor the small mixing scenarios for which the direct limits from Tevatron and\nLHC are not applicable, and the lepton bounds we obtain are stronger than the\ncollider limits.

It works as follows: use a\nsecret but fixed Strongly Universal$_2$ (SU$_2$) hash function and encrypt the\noutput tag with a one-time pad (OTP). If the OTP is completely secret, the\nexpected time for an adversary to create a tag for a chosen message is\nexponential in the tag length. If, however, the OTP is partially known in each\nauthentication round, as is the case in practical QKD protocols, then the\npicture is different; the adversary's partial knowledge of the OTP in each\nauthentication round gives partial information on the secret hash function, and\nthis weakens the authentication in later rounds. The effect of this is that the\nlifetime of the system is linear in the length of the fixed key. This is\nsupported by the composability theorem for QKD, that in this setting provides\nan upper bound to the security loss on the secret hash function, which is\nexponential in the number of authentication rounds. This needs to be taken into\naccount when using the protocol, since the authentication gets weakened at each\nsubsequent round and thus the QKD generated is key is not as strong as when the\nauthentication is strong.

On one side we stress that\nsome aspects of this result are puzzling even from the perspective of the wild\nquantum-gravity literature, where arguments in favor of the possibility of\nsuperluminal propagation have been presented, but not considering the\npossibility of such a sizeable effect for neutrinos of such low energies. We\nfeel this must encourage particularly severe scrutiny of the OPERA result. On\nthe other side, we notice that the OPERA result is reasonably consistent with\n$\\mu$-neutrino-speed data previously obtained at FERMILAB, reported in papers\nof 2007 and 1979. And it is intriguing that these FERMILAB79 and FERMILAB07\nresults, when combined with the new OPERA result, in principle provide a window\non $\\mu$-neutrino speeds at different energies broad enough to compare\nalternative phenomenological models. We test the discriminating power of such\nan approach by using as illustrative examples the case of special-relativistic\ntachyons, the case of \"Coleman-Glashow-type\" momentum-independent violations of\nthe special-relativistic speed law, and the cases of linear and quadratic\nenergy dependence of the speed of ultrarelativistic muon neutrinos. Even just\nusing $\\mu$-neutrino data in the range from $\\sim$ 3 GeVs to $\\sim$ 200 GeVs\nthe special-relativistic tachyon and the quadratic-dependence case are clearly\ndisfavoured. The linear-dependence case gives a marginally consistent picture\nand the Coleman-Glashow scenario fits robustly the data.

Based on the assumed linear relationship\nbetween GC colors and their metallicities, the bimodality has been taken as\nevidence of two GC subsystems with different metallicities in each galaxy and\nled to a number of theories in the context of galaxy formation. More recent\nobservations and modeling of GCs, however, suggest that the color-metallicity\nrelations (CMRs) are inflected, and thus colors likely trace metallicities in a\nnonlinear manner. The nonlinearity could produce bimodal color distributions\nfrom a broad underlying metallicity spread, even if it is unimodal. Despite the\nfar-reaching implications, whether CMRs are nonlinear and whether the\nnonlinearity indeed causes the color bimodality are still open questions. Given\nthat the spectroscopic refinement of CMRs is still very challenging, we here\npropose a new photometric technique to probe the possible nonlinear nature of\nCMRs. In essence, a color distribution of GCs is a \"projected\" distribution of\ntheir metallicities. Since the form of CMRs hinges on which color is used, the\nshape of color distributions varies depending significantly on the colors.\nAmong other optical colors, the u-band related colors (e.g., u - g and u - z)\nare theoretically predicted to exhibit significantly less inflected CMRs than\nother preferred CMRs (e.g., for g - z). As a case study, we performed the\nHST/WFPC2 archival u-band photometry for the M87 (NGC 4486) GC system with\nconfirmed color bimodality. We show that the u-band color distributions are\nsignificantly different from that of g - z, and consistent with our model\npredictions.

This is generally taken as evidence of highly decoupled\nevolutionary histories between GC systems and their parent galaxies. Here we\nshow, however, that new developments in linking the observed GC colors to their\nintrinsic metallicities suggest nonlinear color-to-metallicity conversions,\nwhich translate observed color distributions into strongly-peaked, unimodal\nMDFs with broad metal-poor tails. Remarkably, the inferred GC MDFs are similar\nto the MDFs of resolved field stars in nearby elliptical galaxies and those\nproduced by chemical evolution models of galaxies. The GC MDF shape,\ncharacterized by a sharp peak with a metal-poor tail, indicates a virtually\ncontinuous chemical enrichment with a relatively short timescale. The\ncharacteristic shape emerges across three orders of magnitude in the host\ngalaxy mass, suggesting a universal process of chemical enrichment among\nvarious GC systems. Given that GCs are bluer than field stars within the same\ngalaxy, it is plausible that the chemical enrichment processes of GCs ceased\nsomewhat earlier than that of field stellar population, and if so, GCs\npreferentially trace the major, vigorous mode of star formation events in\ngalactic formation. We further suggest a possible systematic age difference\namong GC systems, in that the GC systems in more luminous galaxies are older.\nThis is consistent with the downsizing paradigm of galaxies and supports\nadditionally the similar nature shared by GCs and field stars. Our findings\nsuggest that GC systems and their parent galaxies have shared a more common\norigin than previously thought, and hence greatly simplify theories of galaxy\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In recent years,\nobservations have largely confirmed many of the properties of this model, which\nis based on a partitioning of the universe's energy density into three primary\nconstituents: matter, radiation, and a hypothesized dark energy which, in\nLambdaCDM, is assumed to be a cosmological constant Lambda. Yet with this\nprogress, several unpalatable coincidences (perhaps even inconsistencies) have\nemerged along with the successful confirmation of expected features. One of\nthese is the observed equality of our gravitational horizon R_h(t_0) with the\ndistance ct_0 light has traveled since the big bang, in terms of the current\nage t_0 of the universe. This equality is very peculiar because it need not\nhave occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right now)\nin the context of LambdaCDM. In this paper, we propose an explanation for why\nthis equality may actually be required by GR, through the application of\nBirkhoff's theorem and the Weyl postulate, at least in the case of a flat\nspacetime. If this proposal is correct, R_h(t) should be equal to ct for all\ncosmic time t, not just its present value t_0. Therefore models such as\nLambdaCDM would be incomplete because they ascribe the cosmic expansion to\nvariable conditions not consistent with this relativistic constraint. We show\nthat this may be the reason why the observed galaxy correlation function is not\nconsistent with the predictions of the standard model. We suggest that an\nR_h=ct universe is easily distinguishable from all other models at large\nredshift (i.e., in the early universe), where the latter all predict a rapid\ndeceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 20:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The\nanalysis focuses on photons recorded above 1 GeV for Fermi detected GRB\n080916C, GRB 090510A, GRB 090902B, and GRB 090926A because these high-energy\nphotons yield the tightest bounds on light dispersion.

Although conceivably a $>3\n\\sigma$ fluctuation, when taken at face value, these pulses lead to an order of\nmagnitude tightening of prior limits on photon dispersion.

The\ncorresponding microwave X-band spectrum at T < 10 K consists of a narrow,\nnearly isotropic signal located at g ~ 2 and a strongly anisotropic component.\nThe first signal, which has a rich structure due to hyperfine interactions with\nthe lattice nuclei, is attributed to the single trapped charge carriers: the\nelectrons and/or the holes. The anisotropic spectrum is caused by the axial\ncenters oriented along the C_{4} pseudo-cubic principal crystalline axes. The\nspectrum angular dependence can be described well by an axial center with S =\n1, g_{\\parallel) = 0.82, g_{\\perp} = 0.52 and D = 0.44 cm^{-1}.

To search more efficiently we first run a densely spaced grid, with\nonly 3 varying parameters; the frequency, the amplitude and the baryon density.\nWe obtain the optimal frequency and run an MCMC at the best fit frequency,\nrandomly varying all other relevant parameters. To reduce the computational\ntime of each power spectrum computation, we adjust both comoving momentum\nintegration and spline interpolation (in l) as a function of frequency and\namplitude of the primordial power spectrum. Applying this to the WMAP 7 data\nallows us to improve existing constraints on the presence of oscillations. We\nconfirm earlier findings that certain frequencies can improve the fitting over\na model without oscillations. For those frequencies we compute the posterior\nprobability, allowing us to put some constraints on the primordial parameter\nspace of both models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2011 13:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
