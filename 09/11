We numerically\nsimulate the reduced dynamics and the creation of entanglement (concurrence) as\na function of the parameters of the thermal environments and the number of\nqubits, N. Our results demonstrate that the two-qubit entanglement generally\ndecreases as N increases. We show analytically that in the limit N tending to\ninfinity, no entanglement can be created. This indicates that collective\nthermal environments cannot create two-qubit entanglement when many qubits are\nlocated within a region of the size of the environment coherence length.

In the low temperature synthesis route it was possible to\nreach x = 0.17 without segregation of Mg rich phase. The exact chemical\ncomposition has been established by quantitative analysis. Rietveld analysis of\nthe XRD data confirms the Wurzite structure and a continuous compaction of the\nlattice (in particular the c-axis parameter) as x increases.

It is\nobserved that NPs of size below 20 nm kept inside a chamber exhibit complete\nreduction in their visible PL when oxygen partial pressure of the surrounding\ngases is decreased by evacuation. However the visible PL from ZnO NPs is\ninsensitive to other major gases present in the ambient air. The rate of change\nof PL intensity with pressure is inversely proportional to the ambient air\npressure and increases when particle size decreases due to the enhanced surface\nto volume ratio. On the other hand an assembly of ZnO NPs behaves as a complete\ninsulator in the presence of dry air and its major components like N2, O2 and\nCO2. Electrical conduction having resistivity ~102 - 103 {\\Omega}m is observed\nin the presence of humid air. The depletion layer formed at the NP surface\nafter acquiring donor electrons of ZnO by the adsorbed oxygen, has been found\nto control the visible PL and increases the contact potential barrier between\nthe NPs which in turn enhances the resistance of the film.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2011 19:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-25"}

Net wind speeds on the order of 1-10 km/s directed\ntowards the night side of the planet are predicted at mbar pressures, which is\nthe approximate pressure level probed by transmission spectroscopy. These winds\nshould result in an observed blue shift of spectral lines in transmission on\nthe order of the wind speed. Indeed, Snellen et al.

The first representation\nis a well known result due to West (1987), and is the better choice for\ncollinear design matrices. The second representation is new, and is more\nefficient for orthogonal problems, largely because it avoids the need to deal\nwith exponentially tilted stable random variables. It also provides insight\ninto the multimodality of the joint posterior distribution, a feature of the\nbridge model that is notably absent under ridge or lasso-type priors.

The high\nfraction of observed triples ($\\sim10$% for F/G/K stars and $\\sim50$% for OB\nstars) give rise to the possibility of the disruption of triples by a MBH. Here\nwe study this scenario, and use direct $N$-body integrations to follow the\norbits of thousands of triples, during and following their disruption by a MBH\n(of $4\\times10^6$ M$_\\odot$, similar to the MBH existing in the Galactic\nCentre; SgrA$^*$).

The orbits of single stars captured\nin a single disruption event are found to be correlated. The eccentricity of\nthe mutual orbits of captured/ejected binaries is typically excited to higher\nvalues. Stellar evolution of captured/ejected binaries may later result in\ntheir coalescence/strong interaction and the formation of hypervelocity blue\nstragglers or merger remnants in orbits around SgrA*.

Since direct measurements of the permeability are\ntime consuming and require experiments that are not always possible, the\nreliable theoretical assessment of the permeability based on the medium\nstructural characteristics alone is of importance. When the porosity approaches\nunity, the permeability-porosity relationships represented by the Kozeny-Carman\nequations and Archie's law predict that permeability tends to infinity and thus\nthey yield unrealistic results if specific area of the porous media does not\ntend to zero. The goal of this paper is an evaluation of the relationships\nbetween porosity and permeability for a set of fractal models with porosity\napproaching unity and a finite permeability. It is shown that the tube bundles\ngenerated by finite iterations of the corresponding geometric fractals can be\nused to model porous media where the permeability-porosity relationships are\nderived analytically. Several examples of the tube bundles are constructed and\nrelevance of the derived permeability-porosity relationships is discussed in\nconnection with the permeability measurements of highly porous metal foams\nreported in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 09:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 21:18:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 15:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 May 2012 10:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 13 May 2012 06:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-15"}

We sum over the infinite particle-hole ladder diagrams so that\nthe particle-particle and particle-hole $T$-matrices are entangled with each\nother. We find that the particle-hole susceptibility has a complex dynamical\nstructure, with strong momentum and frequency dependencies, and is sensitive to\ntemperature, gap size and interaction strength. We conclude that neglecting the\nself-energy feedback causes a serious over-estimate of the particle-hole\nsusceptibility. In the BCS limit, the particle-hole channel effect may be\napproximated by the same reduction in the overall pairing strength so that the\nratio $2\\Delta(0)/T_{\\text{c}}$ is unaffected, in agreement with Gor'kov\n\\textit{et al.} to the leading order.

Deep in the\nBEC regime, the particle-hole channel contributions drop to zero.

In the\nexisting literature, the convergence results of such algorithms are established\nassuming the problem specific parameters remain unchanged during the\niterations. However, this assumption is unrealistic in time varying wireless\nsystems, as explicit message passing is usually involved in the iterations and\nthe channel state information (CSI) may change in a time scale comparable to\nthe algorithm update period. This paper investigates the convergence behavior\nand the tracking error of primal-dual iterative algorithms under time varying\nCSI. The convergence results are established by studying the stability of an\nequivalent virtual dynamic system derived in the paper, and the Lyapunov theory\nis applied for the stability analysis. We show that the average tracking error\nis proportional to the time variation rate of the CSI. Based on these analyses,\nwe also derive an adaptive primal-dual algorithm by introducing a compensation\nterm to reduce the tracking error under the time varying CSI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 13:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}
