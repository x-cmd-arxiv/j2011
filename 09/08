The\nmodel is based on a parameterized relation between the dust-processed infrared\nluminosity and (sub)halo mass. By adjusting 3 free parameters, we attempt to\nsimultaneously fit the 4 frequency bands of the Planck measurement of the CIB\nanisotropy power spectrum. To fit the data, we find that the star-formation\nefficiency must peak on a halo mass scale of ~ 5x10^12 solar mass and the\ninfrared luminosity per unit mass must increase rapidly with redshift. By\ncomparing our predictions with a well-calibrated phenomenological model for\nshot noise, and with a direct observation of source counts, we show that the\nmean duty cycle of the underlying infrared sources must be near unity,\nindicating that the CIB is dominated by long-lived quiescent star formation,\nrather than intermittent short \"star bursts\".

The optimal molecular\nconfigurations, at which the nucleotides strongly couple to the CNTs, and which\nyield the largest transmission, are first identified. Then the electronic\nstructures and the electron transport of these optimal configurations are\nanalyzed. The typical tunneling currents are of the order of 50 nA for voltages\nup to 1 V. At higher bias, where resonant transport through the molecular\nstates is possible, the current is of the order of several $\\mu$A. Below 1 V\nthe currents associated to the different nucleotides are consistently\ndistinguishable, with adenine having the largest current, guanine the\nsecond-largest, cytosine the third and finally thymine the smallest.

A player seeks to activate $K \\geq 1$ arms at each time in\norder to maximize the expected total reward obtained over multiple plays. RMAB\nis a challenging problem that is known to be PSPACE-hard in general. We\nconsider in this work the even harder non-Bayesian RMAB, in which the\nparameters of the Markov chain are assumed to be unknown \\emph{a priori}. We\ndevelop an original approach to this problem that is applicable when the\ncorresponding Bayesian problem has the structure that, depending on the known\nparameter values, the optimal solution is one of a prescribed finite set of\npolicies. In such settings, we propose to learn the optimal policy for the\nnon-Bayesian RMAB by employing a suitable meta-policy which treats each policy\nfrom this finite set as an arm in a different non-Bayesian multi-armed bandit\nproblem for which a single-arm selection policy is optimal. We demonstrate this\napproach by developing a novel sensing policy for opportunistic spectrum access\nover unknown dynamic channels. We prove that our policy achieves\nnear-logarithmic regret (the difference in expected reward compared to a\nmodel-aware genie), which leads to the same average reward that can be achieved\nby the optimal policy under a known model. This is the first such result in the\nliterature for a non-Bayesian RMAB.

Here, we argue that high-redshift population III galaxies with strong\nLya emission can be identified in Hubble Space Telescope imaging data because\nof their unusual colours. We quantify this effect in some of the filters used\nin Y-band dropout searches for galaxies at z~8 and find that population III\ngalaxies with high Lya fluxes may exhibit much bluer J-H colours at z=8-10 than\nany normal type of galaxy at these redshifts. This colour signature can arise\neven if pop III stars account for as little as ~1e-3 to ~1e-2 of the stellar\nmass in these galaxies.

Low mass planets (down to ~0.03 Earth mass at 1 AU)\nand high spatial resolution (256 grid points per scale height) are chosen to\nmitigate the effects of wave nonlinearity. To complement the existing numerical\nstudies, we focus on the primary physical variables such as the spatial profile\nof the wave, torque density, and the angular momentum flux carried by the wave,\ninstead of secondary quantities such as the planetary migration rate.

As the\ninfluence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution is becoming more\nevident, their large scale environments may help us understand the evolutionary\nprocesses leading to activity. The effect of activity can be seen particularly\nby showing if different types of active galaxies are formed by similar\nmechanisms. Our aim is to study the supercluster-scale environments of active\ngalaxies up to redshift 0.4. Our data includes quasars, BL Lac objects, Seyfert\nand radio galaxies. We use a three-dimensional low-resolution\nluminosity-density field constructed of a sample of luminous red galaxies in\nthe seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculate the\naverage density of this field in a volume of a 3\\,$h^{-1}$Mpc sphere around\neach AGN for estimating the environmental density levels of different types of\nAGN. This analysis gives us the distribution of AGN in the global environment\nof superclusters, filaments, and voids. Our results show that while radio-quiet\nquasars and Seyfert galaxies are mostly located in low-density regions, radio\ngalaxies have higher environmental densities. BL Lac objects usually have\nlow-density environments, but some of them are also in very high density\nregions. Our results give support to the theory of galaxy evolution where\ngalaxies are affected by two modes of AGN feedback: quasar mode that turns a\nblue star-forming galaxy into a red and dead one, and radio mode that regulates\nthe growth of massive elliptical galaxies. We conclude that quasars are in\nlower density environments than radio galaxies most likely because the galaxies\nin rich environments have evolved to a state suitable for radio-loud activity\nearlier. Galaxies in poor environment have evolved slower, and are still going\nthrough the earlier quasar mode feedback in galaxy evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 13:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Here I provide such a calculation. The\ntypical stellar mass is set by the characteristic fragment mass in a\nstar-forming cloud, which depends on the cloud's density and temperature\nstructure. Except in the very early universe, the latter is determined mainly\nby the radiation released as matter falls onto seed protostars. The energy\nyield from this process is ultimately set by the properties of deuterium\nburning in protostellar cores, which determines the stars' radii. I show that\nit is possible to combine these considerations to compute a characteristic\nstellar mass almost entirely in terms of fundamental constants, with an\nextremely weak residual dependence on the interstellar pressure and\nmetallicity. This result not only explains the invariance of stellar masses, it\nresolves a second mystery: why fragmentation of a cold, low-density\ninterstellar cloud, a process with no obvious dependence on the properties of\nnuclear reactions, happens to select a stellar mass scale such that stellar\ncores can ignite hydrogen. Finally, the weak residual dependence on the\ninterstellar pressure and metallicity may explain recent observational hints of\na smaller characteristic mass in the high pressure, high metallicity cores of\ngiant elliptical galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 20:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Spectral analysis\nsuggests a power law of index 1.0 pm 0.3 with an energy cut-off at 0.8 pm 0.2\nGeV. The first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. We\ndiscuss the emission models of PSR J1119-6127 and demonstrate that despite the\nobject's high surface magnetic field---near that of magnetars---the field\nstrength and structure in the gamma-ray emitting zone are apparently similar to\nthose of typical young pulsars. Additionally, we present upper limits on the\n\\gam-ray pulsed emission for the magnetically active PSR J1846-0258 in the\nsupernova remnant Kesteven 75 and two other energetic high-B pulsars, PSRs\nJ1718-3718 and J1734-3333.

These criticisms are rather redundant, as they mostly\nrehash material I have already discussed. Gnedin is concerned with explaining\naway the problem of the apparently missing baryons with ionized gas. This is\none hypothetical possibility that I have previously discussed (McGaugh et al.\n2010; McGaugh & Wolf 2010; McGaugh 2011b). Foreman & Scott claim to find a\ndifference between the acceleration scale that they measure and that I measure\nfrom the same data, but the apparent difference results simply from their\nfailure to account for the well known fact (Binney & Tremaine 1987) that\nflattened disks rotate faster than the equivalent spherical mass distribution\n(as spelled out for this application in McGaugh 2011b). They further argue that\nthe the intrinsic scatter in the BTFR is merely tiny rather than zero. This\ndifference is within the uncertainty of the uncertainties, so confirms rather\nthan refutes my result. Worse, these papers miss the basic point. Why does MOND\nhave any predictions come true? Why does it provide such an effective and\neconomical description of galaxy dynamics? They do nothing to address these\ndeeper questions. One can imagine that the apparently MONDian behavior of\ngalaxies is merely an approximation to some phenomenology that emerges in the\ncontext of LCDM, but we have yet to demonstrate how this occurs.

In [1], the authors considered the\nlinear asymmetric model of Wyner, where each transmitter is connected to its\nown receiver and its successor, and is aware of its own message as well as M-1\npreceding messages. The per user DoF was shown to go to M/(M+1) as the number\nof users increases to infinity.

We show that the relaxation of the cooperation constraint,\nwhile maintaining the same load imposed on a backhaul link needed to distribute\nthe messages, results in a gain in the DoF. In particular, the asymptotic limit\nof the per user DoF under the cooperation order constraint is (2M)/(2M+1) .\nMoreover, the optimal transmit set selection satisfies a local cooperation\nconstraint. i.e., each message needs only to be available at neighboring\ntransmitters.

A\ndistribution function approach where RSD can be written as a sum over density\nweighted velocity moment correlators has recently been developed. We use Nbody\nsimulations to investigate the individual contributions and convergence of this\nexpansion for dark matter. If the series is expanded as a function of powers of\nmu, cosine of the angle between the Fourier mode and line of sight, there are a\nfinite number of terms contributing at each order. We present these terms and\ninvestigate their contribution to the total as a function of wavevector k. For\nmu^2 the correlation between density and momentum dominates on large scales.\nHigher order corrections, which act as a Finger-of-God (FoG) term, contribute\n1% at k~0.015h/Mpc, 10% at k~0.05h/Mpc at z=0, while for k>0.15h/Mpc they\ndominate and make the total negative. These higher order terms are dominated by\ndensity-energy density correlations which contribute negatively to the power,\nwhile the contribution from vorticity part of momentum density auto-correlation\nis an order of magnitude lower. For mu^4 term the dominant term on large scales\nis the scalar part of momentum density auto-correlation, while higher order\nterms dominate for k>0.15h/Mpc. For mu^6 and mu^8 we find it has very little\npower for k<0.15h/Mpc. We also compare the expansion to the full 2D P^ss(k,mu)\nas well as to their multipoles. For these statistics an infinite number of\nterms contribute and we find that the expansion achieves percent level accuracy\nfor kmu<0.15h/Mpc at 6th order, but breaks down on smaller scales because the\nseries is no longer perturbative. We explore resummation of the terms into FoG\nkernels, which extend the convergence up to a factor of 2 in scale.

The planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low density\nof 0.111\\pm0.010 g cm-3. We detect the occultation of the planet at a\nsignificance of 3.7{\\sigma} in the Kepler bandpass.

The forthcoming Juno mission to\nJupiter might determine Jupiter's normalized moment of inertia NMoI=C/MR^2 by\nmeasuring Jupiter's pole precession and the Lense-Thirring acceleration of the\nspacecraft (C is the axial moment of inertia, and M and R are Jupiter's mass\nand mean radius, respectively). We investigate the possible range of NMoI\nvalues for Jupiter based on its measured gravitational field using a simple\ncore/envelope model of the planet assuming that J_2 and J_4 are perfectly known\nand are equal to their measured values. The model suggests that for fixed\nvalues of J_2 and J_4 a range of NMOI values between 0.2629 and 0.2645 can be\nfound. The Radau-Darwin relation gives a NMoI value that is larger than the\nmodel values by less than 1%. A low NMoI of ~ 0.236, inferred from a dynamical\nmodel (Ward & Canup, 2006, ApJ, 640, L91) is inconsistent with this range, but\nthe range is model dependent. Although we conclude that the NMoI is tightly\nconstrained by the gravity coefficients, a measurement of Jupiter's NMoI to a\nfew tenths of percent by Juno could provide an important constraint on\nJupiter's internal structure. We carry out a simplified assessment of the error\ninvolved in Juno's possible determination of Jupiter's NMoI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 04:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

One way to circumvent this problem is to assume that the covariance\nmatrix is nearly sparse and to focus on estimating only the significant\nentries. To analyze this approach, Levina and Vershynin (2011) introduce a\nformalism called masked covariance estimation, where each entry of the sample\ncovariance estimator is reweighted to reflect an a priori assessment of its\nimportance.

They go beyond the usual Dirac phase\nfactors and they exhibit nonlocal quantal behavior, with the well-known\nRelativistic Causality of classical fields affecting directly the phases of\nwavefunctions in the Schr\\\"odinger Picture. These nonlocal phase behaviors,\napparently overlooked in path-integral approaches, give a natural account of\nthe dynamical nonlocality character of the various (even static) Aharonov-Bohm\nphenomena, while at the same time they seem to respect Causality. For particles\npassing through nonvanishing magnetic or electric fields they lead to\ncancellations of Aharonov-Bohm phases at the observation point, generalizing\nearlier semiclassical experimental observations (of Werner & Brill) to\ndelocalized (spread-out) quantum states. This leads to a correction of\npreviously unnoticed sign-errors in the literature, and to a natural\nexplanation of the deeper reason why certain time-dependent semiclassical\narguments are consistent with static results in purely quantal Aharonov-Bohm\nconfigurations. These nonlocalities also provide a remedy for misleading\nresults propagating in the literature (concerning an uncritical use of Dirac\nphase factors, that persists since the time of Feynman's work on path\nintegrals). They are shown to conspire in such a way as to exactly cancel the\ninstantaneous Aharonov-Bohm phase and recover Relativistic Causality in earlier\n\" paradoxes\" (such as the van Kampen thought-experiment), and to also complete\nPeshkin's discussion of the electric Aharonov-Bohm effect in a causal manner.\nThe present formulation offers a direct way to address time-dependent single-\nvs double-slit experiments and the associated causal issues -- issues that have\nrecently attracted attention, with respect to the inability of current theories\nto address them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 07:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-09"}

We contribute to this\ninvestigation by giving a semantics that is standard, coherent, and\nsufficiently general for completeness while remaining relatively easy to\ncompute with. Our models interpret types of Martin-L\\\"of's extensional\ndependent type theory as sets indexed over posets or, equivalently, as\nfibrations over posets. This semantics can be seen as a generalization to\ndependent type theory of the interpretation of intuitionistic first-order logic\nin Kripke models. This yields a simple coherent model theory, with respect to\nwhich simple and dependent type theory are sound and complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 12:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 14:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

Existence of Hamiltonian cycle allows efficient emulation of\ndistributed algorithms on a network wherever such algorithm exists for\nlinear-array and ring, and can ensure deadlock freedom in some routing\nalgorithms in hierarchical interconnection networks. Hamiltonicity can also be\nused for construction of independent spanning tree and leads to designing fault\ntolerant protocols. Optical Transpose Interconnection Systems or OTIS (also\nreferred to as two-level swapped network) is a widely studied interconnection\nnetwork topology which is popular due to high degree of scalability,\nregularity, modularity and package ability. Surprisingly, to our knowledge,\nonly one strong result is known regarding Hamiltonicity of OTIS - showing that\nOTIS graph built of Hamiltonian base graphs are Hamiltonian. In this work we\nconsider Hamiltonicity of OTIS networks, built on Non-Hamiltonian base and\nanswer some important questions.

The Bethe approximation and the BP algorithm are heuristic\nmethods for estimating the partition function and marginal probabilities in\ngraphical models, respectively. The computational complexity of the Bethe\napproximation is decided by the number of operations required to solve a set of\nnon-linear equations, the so-called Bethe equation. Although the BP algorithm\nwas inspired and developed independently, Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss (2004)\nshowed that the BP algorithm solves the Bethe equation if it converges\n(however, it often does not). This naturally motivates the following question\nto understand limitations and empirical successes of the Bethe and BP methods:\nis the Bethe equation computationally easy to solve? We present a\nmessage-passing algorithm solving the Bethe equation in a polynomial number of\noperations for general binary graphical models of n variables where the maximum\ndegree in the underlying graph is O(log n). Our algorithm can be used as an\nalternative to BP fixing its convergence issue and is the first fully\npolynomial-time approximation scheme for the BP fixed-point computation in such\na large class of graphical models, while the approximate fixed-point\ncomputation is known to be (PPAD-)hard in general.

Active galactic\nnuclei consist of accreting supermassive black holes hosted by a galaxy that\npresent in some cases powerful relativistic jet activity. These sources, which\nhave been studied in gamma rays for several decades, are probably the most\nenergetic astrophysical objects, and their appearance depends much on whether\ntheir jets point to us. Gamma-ray bursts, thought to be associated to\ncollapsing or merging stellar-mass objects at cosmological distances, are also\naccreting highly relativistic jet sources that shine strongly at high energies.\nThese are very short-duration events, but they are also the most luminous.\nRecently, star formation galaxies have turned out to be also gamma-ray\nemitters.

Material is followed in from the\ncore to the disk and a full gas-phase chemistry network -- including freeze-out\nonto and evaporation from cold dust grains -- is evolved along these\ntrajectories. The abundances thus obtained are compared to the results from a\nstatic disk model and to observations of comets.\n  Results: The chemistry during the collapse phase is dominated by a few key\nprocesses, such as the evaporation of CO or the photodissociation of H2O. At\nthe end of the collapse phase, the disk can be divided into zones with\ndifferent chemical histories. The disk is not in chemical equilibrium at the\nend of the collapse, so care must be taken when choosing the initial abundances\nfor stand-alone disk chemistry models. Our model results imply that comets must\nbe formed from material with different chemical histories: some of it is\nstrongly processed, some of it remains pristine.

Being pNGB,\nthe TD should have a mass M_TD lighter than other techni-hadrons like\ntechni-rho meson; It has recently been estimated to be M_TD ~= 500-600 GeV for\nthe typical WTC model, which is well in the discovery range of the ongoing LHC\nexperiment. Noting that all the TD couplings to the standard model (SM)\nparticles arise only through loop of the techni-fermions with their induced\nYukawa couplings to the composite TD, we find that the TD-WW and ZZ couplings\nget dramatically suppressed compared with those of the SM Higgs which has\ntree-level couplings proportional to their masses. In contrast, TD couplings to\ngg, t tbar and gamma gamma are not suppressed and hence are relatively enhanced\ncompared to those of the SM Higgs.

Remarkably, the WW/ZZ mode is shown to be consistent with\nthe recent ATLAS and CMS bounds for M_TD > 350(400) GeV in the one-doublet\n(one-family) model, thanks to the suppressed WW/ZZ coupling in sharp contrast\nto the SM Higgs.

The first\ncluster sample from the survey covers a wide range of redshifts from 0.09 to\n0.61, bolometric luminosities L_500 = 1.9 x 10^42 - 1.2 x 10^45 erg/s, and\nmasses M_500 = 2.3 x 10^13 - 4.9 x 10^14 Msun. We extend the relation between\nthe X-ray bolometric luminosity L_500 and the X-ray temperature towards\nsignificantly lower T and L and still find that the slope of the linear L-T\nrelation is consistent with values published for high luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 15:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-09"}

[Phys. Rev. A 82, 042325 (2010)] demonstrated that two\narbitrated quantum signature (AQS) schemes are not secure, because an\narbitrator cannot arbitrate the dispute between two users when a receiver\nrepudiates the integrity of a signature. By using a public board, Zou et al.\nproposed two AQS schemes to solve the problem. This work shows that the same\nsecurity problem may exist in Zou et al.'s schemes. Moreover, a malicious\nverifier, Bob, can actively negate a signed order if he wants to. This attack,\na special case of denial-of-service (DoS) attack mentioned in [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n91, 109801 (2003)], is important in quantum cryptography. Bob may get some\nbenefits with this DoS attack, since he can actively deny Alice's signed order\nwithout being detected.
