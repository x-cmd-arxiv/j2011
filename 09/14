They are related in a\nnatural way to semisimple Lie groups. In this work we introduce and study their\ninfinite dimensional generalization: Affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces. Affine\nKac-Moody symmetric spaces are infinite dimensional symmetric spaces associated\nto affine Kac-Moody groups. They have the structure of tame Fr\\'echet\nmanifolds; the natural Ad-invariant scalar product on affine Kac-Moody algebras\nis Lorentzian, making affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces into Lorentzian\nsymmetric spaces. Similar to affine Kac-Moody groups sharing most of their\nstructure properties with simple Lie group, also Kac-Moody symmetric spaces\nshare most of their structure properties with their finite dimensional\nRiemannian counterparts. In particular the classification of Kac-Moody\nsymmetric spaces follows the lines of the classification of finite dimensional\nRiemannian symmetric spaces: There are four types distinguished, which fall\ninto the two classes of Kac-Moody symmetric spaces of the compact type and of\nthe noncompact type. Symmetric spaces of the compact type and of the noncompact\ntype are related by a duality relation. In addition the geometry of the rank\n1-building blocks is the same for Kac-Moody symmetric spaces as for finite\ndimensional Riemannian symmetric spaces. Kac-Moody symmetric spaces appear in\nmathematics and theoretical physics: for example their isotropy representations\nare essentially equivalent to polar actions on Hilbert spaces; twin cities can\nbe embedded equivariantly into the tangent space. In theoretical physics\nKac-Moody symmetric spaces got recently a prominent place due to various\nconjectures relating them to certain formulations of supergravity theories and\nM-theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 16:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-14"}

A better agreement is found assuming a minimum Dark\nMatter halo mass for black hole formation and growth.

Noguchi (1998,1999) suggested another\nbulge formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a\nnumerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form\nclumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc\nis expected to be highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic\ncentre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the centre.

Thus, the\ncorotation distance moves inward. This has important implications for the tidal\nevolution of planets around BDs. We used a standard equilibrium tidal model to\ncompute the orbital evolution of a large ensemble of planet-BD systems. We\ntested the effect of numerous parameters such as the initial semi-major axis\nand eccentricity, the rotation period of the BD, the masses of both the BD and\nplanet, and the tidal dissipation factors.

The intensity variation due to CME\ninteraction reported in [1] is confirmed by expanding the investigation to all\nthe large SEP events of solar cycle 23. The large SEP events are separated into\ntwo groups, one associated with CMEs running into other CMEs, and the other\nwith CMEs running into the ambient solar wind. SEP events with CME interaction\ngenerally have a higher intensity. New possibilities such as the influence of\ncoronal holes on the SEP intensity are also discussed. For example, the\npresence of a large coronal hole between a well-connected eruption and the\nsolar disk center may render the shock poorly connected because of the\ninteraction between the CME and the coronal hole. This point is illustrated\nusing the 2004 December 3 SEP event delayed by about 12 hours from the onset of\nthe associated CME. There is no other event at the Sun that can be associated\nwith the SEP onset. This event is consistent with the possibility that the\ncoronal hole interaction influences the connectivity of the CMEs that produce\nSEPs, and hence the intensity of the SEP event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 21:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

After the gas disk's\ndispersal, Uranus and Neptune were likely scattered by gas giants, and\napproached their current orbits while dispersing the transplanetary disk of\nplanetesimals, whose remains survived to this time in the region known as the\nKuiper belt. Here we performed N-body integrations of the scattering phase\nbetween giant planets in an attempt to determine which initial states are\nplausible. We found that the dynamical simulations starting with a resonant\nsystem of four giant planets have a low success rate in matching the present\norbits of giant planets, and various other constraints (e.g., survival of the\nterrestrial planets). The dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if\nJupiter and Saturn start in the 3:2 resonance, and leads to final systems with\nfewer than four planets. Several initial states stand out in that they show a\nrelatively large likelihood of success in matching the constraints. Some of the\nstatistically best results were obtained when assuming that the solar system\ninitially had five giant planets and one ice giant, with the mass comparable to\nthat of Uranus and Neptune, was ejected to interstellar space by Jupiter. This\npossibility appears to be conceivable in view of the recent discovery of a\nlarge number free-floating planets in interstellar space, which indicates that\nplanet ejection should be common.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 23:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

To this end, several notions of communicability have been\nintroduced and applied to a wide variety of real-world networks in recent\nyears. Several such communicability functions are reviewed in this paper. It is\nemphasized that communication and correlation in networks can take place\nthrough many more routes than the shortest paths, a fact that may not have been\nsufficiently appreciated in previously proposed correlation measures. In\ncontrast to these, the communicability measures reviewed in this paper are\ndefined by taking into account all possible routes between two nodes, assigning\nsmaller weights to longer ones. This point of view naturally leads to the\ndefinition of communicability in terms of matrix functions, such as the\nexponential, resolvent, and hyperbolic functions, in which the matrix argument\nis either the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian associated with the\nnetwork. Considerable insight on communicability can be gained by modeling a\nnetwork as a system of oscillators and deriving physical interpretations, both\nclassical and quantum-mechanical, of various communicability functions.\nApplications of communicability measures to the analysis of complex systems are\nillustrated on a variety of biological, physical and social networks. The last\npart of the paper is devoted to a review of the notion of locality in complex\nnetworks and to computational aspects that by exploiting sparsity can greatly\nreduce the computational efforts for the calculation of communicability\nfunctions for large networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 23:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

They can be ejected from the solar\nsystem by Jupiter, thermally destroyed near the Sun, or physically disrupted by\ncollisions. Also, some are swept by the Earth (and other planets), producing\nmeteors. Here we develop a dynamical model for the solar system meteoroids and\nuse it to explain meteor radar observations. We find that the Jupiter Family\nComets (JFCs) are the main source of the prominent concentrations of meteors\narriving to the Earth from the helion and antihelion directions. To match the\nradiant and orbit distributions, as measured by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar\n(CMOR) and Advanced Meteor Orbit Radar (AMOR), our model implies that comets,\nand JFCs in particular, must frequently disintegrate when reaching orbits with\nlow perihelion distance. Also, the collisional lifetimes of millimeter\nparticles may be longer (>10^5 yr at 1 AU) than postulated in the standard\ncollisional models (10^4 yr at 1 AU), perhaps because these chondrule-sized\nmeteoroids are stronger than thought before. Using observations of the Infrared\nAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) to calibrate the model, we find that the total\ncross section and mass of small meteoroids in the inner solar system are\n(1.7-3.5)x10^11 km^2 and 4x10^19 g, respectively, in a good agreement with\nprevious studies. The mass input required to keep the Zodiacal Cloud (ZC) in a\nsteady state is estimated to be 10^4-10^5 kg/s. The input is up to 10 times\nlarger than found previously, mainly because particles released closer to the\nSun have shorter collisional lifetimes, and need to be supplied at a faster\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 03:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

To better assess what remains unknown, we\npropose instead to predict the fraction of the environment that belongs to\nunsampled classes. Modeling samples as draws with replacement of colored balls\nfrom an urn with an unknown composition, and under the sole assumption that\nthere are still undiscovered species, we show that conditionally unbiased\npredictors and exact prediction intervals (of constant length in logarithmic\nscale) are possible for the fraction of the environment that belongs to\nunsampled classes. Our predictions are based on a Poissonization argument,\nwhich we have implemented in what we call the Embedding algorithm. In fixed\ni.e. non-randomized sample sizes, the algorithm leads to very accurate\npredictions on a sub-sample of the original sample. We quantify the effect of\nfixed sample sizes on our prediction intervals and test our methods and others\nfound in the literature against simulated environments, which we devise taking\ninto account datasets from a human-gut and -hand microbiota.

An investigation of the\nrelationship among G8.7-0.1 and the TeV unidentified source HESS J1804-216\nprovides us with an important clue on diffusion process of cosmic rays if\nparticle acceleration operates in the SNR. The GeV gamma-ray emission is\nextended with most of the emission in positional coincidence with the SNR\nG8.7-0.1 and a lesser part located outside the western boundary of G8.7-0.1.\nThe region of the gamma-ray emission overlaps spatially-connected molecular\nclouds, implying a physical connection for the gamma-ray structure.

NGC 185 is one of the\nfour brightest dwarf companions of M31, but unlike than the other three, NGC\n147, NGC 205, and NGC 221 (M32) it has an important content of gas and dust. We\nobtained deep spectroscopic observations of the H$\\alpha$ emitting population\nof NGC 185 using GMOS-N at Gemini. As a result, in addition to the bright\nplanetary nebulae (PNe) previously found in the galaxy and reported in the\nliterature, we found other, much fainter, PNe. We then re-calculated the\nelectron temperatures and chemical abundances of the brightest ones, and\nderived, for the first time, their electron densities. Our characterisation of\nthe PN population properties is interpreted in terms of the chemical evolution\nof NGC 185, which suggests that it has suffered a significant chemical\nenrichment within the last $\\sim$8 Gyr. We also discovered the first symbiotic\nstar in the galaxy and enlightened the properties of a known supernova remnant\nlocated close to the centre of NGC 185.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 08:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Here we investigate\nthe scattering of a so-called \"skewed coherence beam\", i.e., a short-coherence\nbeam modified such that the field is coherent within slabs that are skewed with\nrespect to the wave fronts.

When applied to quite turbid samples, the technique has the\nremarkable advantage of suppressing the multiple scattering contribution of the\nscattering signal.

This\nassumption proved inaccurate for modern and perspective highly heterogeneous\nHPC platforms. New class of algorithms based on the functional performance\nmodel (FPM), representing the speed of the processor by a function of problem\nsize, has been recently proposed. These algorithms cannot be however employed\nin self-adaptable applications because of very high cost of construction of the\nfunctional performance model. The paper presents a new class of parallel\nalgorithms for highly heterogeneous HPC platforms. Like traditional FPM-based\nalgorithms, these algorithms assume that the speed of the processors is\ncharacterized by speed functions rather than speed constants. Unlike the\ntraditional algorithms, they do not assume the speed functions to be given.\nInstead, they estimate the speed functions of the processors for different\nproblem sizes during their execution. These algorithms do not construct the\nfull speed function for each processor but rather build and use their partial\nestimates sufficient for optimal distribution of computations with a given\naccuracy. The low execution cost of distribution of computations between\nheterogeneous processors in these algorithms make them suitable for employment\nin self-adaptable applications. Experiments with parallel matrix multiplication\napplications based on this approach are performed on local and global\nheterogeneous computational clusters. The results show that the execution time\nof optimal matrix distribution between processors is significantly less, by\norders of magnitude, than the total execution time of the optimized\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 13:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-15"}

Such a\ndevice would offer several important benefits. Muons, like electrons, are point\nparticles so the full center-of-mass energy is available for particle\nproduction. Moreover, on account of their higher mass, muons give rise to very\nlittle synchrotron radiation and produce very little beamstrahlung. The first\nfeature permits the use of a circular collider that can make efficient use of\nthe expensive rf system and whose footprint is compatible with an existing\nlaboratory site. The second feature leads to a relatively narrow energy spread\nat the collision point. Designing an accelerator complex for a muon collider is\na challenging task. Firstly, the muons are produced as a tertiary beam, so a\nhigh-power proton beam and a target that can withstand it are needed to provide\nthe required luminosity of ~1 \\times 10^34 cm^-2s^-1. Secondly, the beam is\ninitially produced with a large 6D phase space, which necessitates a scheme for\nreducing the muon beam emittance (\"cooling\"). Finally, the muon has a short\nlifetime so all beam manipulations must be done very rapidly. The Muon\nAccelerator Program, led by Fermilab and including a number of U.S. national\nlaboratories and universities, has undertaken design and R&D activities aimed\ntoward the eventual construction of a muon collider. Design features of such a\nfacility and the supporting R&D program are described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 14:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-15"}

Our objective is to obtain a set of\nN orthogonal (L\\\"owdin) pulses, which remain time-limited and spectrally\nefficient for UWB systems, from a set of N equidistant translates of a\ntime-limited optimal spectral designed UWB pulse. We derive an approximate\nL\\\"owdin orthogonalization (ALO) by using circulant approximations for the Gram\nmatrix to obtain a practical filter implementation. We show that the centered\nALO and L\\\"owdin pulses converge pointwise to the same Nyquist pulse as N tends\nto infinity. The set of translates of the Nyquist pulse forms an orthonormal\nbasis or the shift-invariant space generated by the initial spectral optimal\npulse. The ALO transform provides a closed-form approximation of the L\\\"owdin\ntransform, which can be implemented in an analog fashion without the need of\nanalog to digital conversions. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay\nbetween the optimization and the orthogonalization procedure by using methods\nfrom the theory of shift-invariant spaces.

Phys. Chem. Lett., {\\bf 2}, 93 (2011)]. Here, we investigate\nthe implications of this scenario through numerical calculations with the\ngeneralized Bloch-Redfield (GBR) equation and the non-interacting blip\napproximation (NIBA). Three key insights into the population dynamics and\nenergy transfer efficiency in FMO are provided. First, it is shown that the\noscillations that are often observed in the population relaxation of the dimer\ncomposed of sites one and two may be completely suppressed in the eight site\nmodel. The presence of the coherent oscillations is shown to depend upon the\nparticular initial preparation of the dimer state. Secondly it is demonstrated\nthat while the presence of the eighth chromophore does not cause a dramatic\nchange in the energy transfer efficiency, it does however lead to a dominant\nenergy transfer pathway which can be characterized by an effective three site\nsystem arranged in an equally spaced downhill configuration. Such a\nconfiguration leads to an optimal value of the site energy of the eighth\nchromophore which is shown to be near to its suggested value. Finally we\nconfirm that the energy transfer process in the eight site FMO complex remains\nefficient and robust. The optimal values of the bath parameters are computed\nand shown to be closer to the experimentally fitted values than those\ncalculated previously for the seven site system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 00:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-16"}
