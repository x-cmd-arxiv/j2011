A quantitative answer to\nthis question is provided by decoupling theorems, which have been developed\nrecently in the area of quantum information theory. This paper builds on\npreceding work, which shows that decoupling is achieved if the evolution on A\nconsists of a typical unitary, chosen with respect to the Haar measure,\nfollowed by a process that adds sufficient decoherence.

A main implication of this result is that decoupling is\nphysical, in the sense that it occurs already for short sequences of random\ntwo-body interactions, which can be modeled as efficient circuits.

While the DoF outer bound is established for every M_T, M_R\nvalue, the achievability is established in general subject to normalization\nwith respect to spatial-extensions. Given spatial-extensions, the achievability\nrelies only on linear beamforming based interference alignment schemes with no\nneed for time/frequency extensions. In the absence of spatial extensions, we\nshow through examples how essentially the same scheme may be applied over\ntime/frequency extensions. The central new insight to emerge from this work is\nthe notion of subspace alignment chains as DoF bottlenecks.\n  The DoF value d(M,N) is a piecewise linear function of M,N, with either M or\nN being the bottleneck within each linear segment.

We construct a category E of\n'plays', and a subcategory V of 'views'. We argue that presheaves on V\nadequately represent 'innocent' strategies, in the sense of game semantics. We\nequip innocent strategies with a simple notion of interaction. We then prove\ndecomposition results for innocent strategies, and, restricting to presheaves\nof finite ordinals, prove that innocent strategies are a final coalgebra for a\npolynomial functor derived from the game. This leads to a translation of CCS\nwith recursive equations. Finally, we propose a notion of 'interactive\nequivalence' for innocent strategies, which is close in spirit to Beffara's\ninterpretation of testing equivalences in concurrency theory. In this\nframework, we consider analogues of fair testing and must testing. We show that\nmust testing is strictly finer in our model than in CCS, since it avoids what\nwe call 'spatial unfairness'.

Thanks to the recent\ndetection of solar-like oscillations in G-K giants in open clusters with\nKepler, we can now directly determine stellar masses for a statistically\nsignificant sample of stars in the old open clusters NGC6791 and NGC6819. The\naim of this work is to constrain the integrated RGB mass loss by comparing the\naverage mass of stars in the red clump (RC) with that of stars in the\nlow-luminosity portion of the RGB (i.e. stars with L <~ L(RC)). Stellar masses\nwere determined by combining the available seismic parameters numax and Dnu\nwith additional photometric constraints and with independent distance\nestimates. We measured the masses of 40 stars on the RGB and 19 in the RC of\nthe old metal-rich cluster NGC6791. We find that the difference between the\naverage mass of RGB and RC stars is small, but significant (Delta M=0.09 +-\n0.03 (random) +- 0.04 (systematic) Msun). Interestingly, such a small DeltaM\ndoes not support scenarios of an extreme mass loss for this metal-rich cluster.\nIf we describe the mass-loss rate with Reimers' prescription, a first\ncomparison with isochrones suggests that the observed DeltaM is compatible with\na mass-loss efficiency parameter in the range 0.1 <~ eta <~ 0.3. Less stringent\nconstraints on the RGB mass-loss rate are set by the analysis of the ~ 2\nGyr-old NGC6819, largely due to the lower mass loss expected for this cluster,\nand to the lack of an independent and accurate distance determination. In the\nnear future, additional constraints from frequencies of individual pulsation\nmodes and spectroscopic effective temperatures, will allow further stringent\ntests of the Dnu and numax scaling relations, which provide a novel, and\npotentially very accurate, means of determining stellar radii and masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 17:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We derive a generalised criterion from MHD wind\ntheory to analyse the launching mechanism of these outflows. The criterion is\nsuccessfully applied to the whole outflow structure and cases with\nsub-Keplerian disc rotation. It allows us to decide whether an outflow is\ndriven centrifugally or by the toroidal magnetic pressure. We show that\nquantities such as the magnetic field line inclination or the ratio of the\ntoroidal to poloidal magnetic field alone are insufficient to determine the\ndriving mechanism of outflows. By performing 12 runs we are able to study the\ninfluence of the initial conditions on the properties of outflows around\nmassive protostars in detail. Our simulations reveal a strong effect of the\nmagnetic field strength on the outflow morphology. In runs with weak fields or\nhigh rotational energies, well collimated, fast jets are observed whereas for\nstrong fields poorly collimated, low-velocity outflows are found. We show that\nthe occurrence of a fast jet is coupled to the existence of a Keplerian\nprotostellar disc. Despite the very different morphologies all outflows are\nlaunched from the discs by centrifugal acceleration with the toroidal magnetic\nfield increasingly contributing to the gas acceleration further away from the\ndiscs. The poor collimation of the outflows in runs with strong fields is a\nconsequence of the weak hoop stresses. This in turn is caused by the slow\nbuild-up of a toroidal field due to sub-Keplerian disc rotation. The mass\nejection/accretion ratios scatter around a mean of 0.3 in accordance with\nobservational and analytical results. We suggest an evolutionary scenario for\nthe earliest stage of massive star formation in which initially poorly\ncollimated outflows develop which progressively get better collimated due to\nthe generation of fast jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 18:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 15:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The carrier\ndensity dependence of the mobility is qualitatively different in thin and thick\ngraphene, with the transition occurring at about 2 layers.

Likewise,\ncosmic structure formation is expected to give rise to subsonic turbulence in\nthe intergalactic medium, which may substantially modify the thermodynamic\nstructure of gas in virialized dark matter halos and affect small-scale mixing\nprocesses in the gas. Numerical simulations have played a key role in\ncharacterizing the properties of astrophysical turbulence, but thus far\nsystematic code comparisons have been restricted to the supersonic regime,\nleaving it unclear whether subsonic turbulence is faithfully represented by the\nnumerical techniques commonly employed in astrophysics. Here we focus on\ncomparing the accuracy of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and our new\nmoving-mesh technique AREPO in simulations of driven subsonic turbulence. To\nmake contact with previous results, we also analyze simulations of transsonic\nand highly supersonic turbulence. We find that the widely employed standard\nformulation of SPH yields problematic results in the subsonic regime. Instead\nof building up a Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade, large-scale eddies are\nquickly damped close to the driving scale and decay into small-scale velocity\nnoise. Reduced viscosity settings improve the situation, but the shape of the\ndissipation range differs compared with expectations for a Kolmogorov cascade.\nIn contrast, our moving-mesh technique does yield power-law scaling laws for\nthe power spectra of velocity, vorticity and density, consistent with\nexpectations for fully developed isotropic turbulence. We show that large\nerrors in SPH's gradient estimate and the associated subsonic velocity noise\nare ultimately responsible for producing inaccurate results in the subsonic\nregime. In contrast, SPH's performance is much better for supersonic\nturbulence.

Our formula is much easier to use than a full\ndistribution function. It has fewer parameters than a multi-Gaussian fit, and\nthe best-fitting model parameters give insight into the underlying disc\ndynamics. In particular, once the azimuthal velocities of a sample have been\nsuccessfully fitted, the apparatus provides a prediction for the corresponding\ndistribution of radial velocities vR . An effective formula like ours is\ninvaluable when fitting to data for stars at some distance from the Sun because\nit enables one to make proper allowance for the errors in distance and proper\nmotion when determining the underlying disc kinematics.

Taking in recent years particles' statistics explicitly into account,\nwithin the MCTDH for fermions (MCTDHF) and for bosons (MCTDHB), has opened up\nfurther opportunities to treat larger systems of interacting identical\nparticles, primarily in laser-atom and cold-atom physics. With the increase of\nexperimental capabilities to simultaneously trap mixtures of two, three, and\npossibly even multiple kinds of interacting composite identical particles\ntogether, we set up the stage in the present work and specify the MCTDH method\nfor such cases. Explicitly, the MCTDH method for systems with three kinds of\nidentical particles interacting via all combinations of two- and three-body\nforces is presented, and the resulting equations-of-motion are briefly\ndiscussed. All four possible mixtures of fermions and bosons are presented in a\nunified manner. Particular attention is paid to represent the coefficients'\npart of the equations-of-motion in a compact recursive form in terms of\none-body density operators only. The recursion utilizes the recently proposed\nCombinadic-based mapping for fermionic and bosonic operators in Fock space\n[Phys. Rev.

It is based on purely instrumental observable quantities,\nconsidered in a two-dimensional X-ray colour-magnitude diagram (hardness ratio\nversus count-rate). The basic principle is that, even in rather shallow\nsurveys, substantial information on cluster redshift and temperature is present\nin the raw X-ray data and can be statistically extracted; in parallel, such\ndiagrams can be readily predicted from an ab initio cosmological modeling. We\nillustrate the methodology for the case of a 100 deg2 XMM survey having a\nsensitivity of ~10^{-14} ergs/s/cm^2 and fit at the same time, the survey\nselection function, the cluster evolutionary scaling-relations and the\ncosmology; our sole assumption -- driven by the limited size of the sample\nconsidered in the case-study -- is that the local cluster scaling relations are\nknown. We devote special care to the realistic modeling of the count-rate\nmeasurement uncertainties and evaluate the potential of the method via a Fisher\nanalysis. In the absence of individual cluster redshifts, the CR-HR method\nappears to be much more efficient than the traditional approach based on\ncluster counts (i.e. dn/dz, requiring redshifts). In the case where redshifts\nare available, our method performs similarly as the traditional mass function\n(dn/dM/dz) for the purely cosmological parameters, but better constrains\nparameters defining the cluster scaling relations and their evolution. A\nfurther practical advantage of the CR-HR method is its simplicity : this fully\ntop-down approach totally bypasses the tedious steps consisting in deriving\ncluster masses from X-ray temperature measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 22:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 08:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

A MCMC\nprocedure simultaneously fits the cosmological parameters, the evolution of the\ncluster scaling laws and the selection effects.

The dwarf galaxy is assumed to have a stellar\nnucleus (or a nuclear star cluster) that could be the progenitor for NGC 1851.\nWe find that although the dark matter halo and the stellar envelope of the host\ndwarf of NGC 1851 can be almost completely stripped during its orbital\nevolution around the Galaxy, a minor fraction of stars in the dwarf can remain\ntrapped by the gravitational field of the nucleus. The stripped nucleus can be\nobserved as NGC 1851 with no/little dark matter whereas stars around the\nnucleus can be observed as a diffuse stellar halo around NGC 1851. The\nsimulated stellar halo has a symmetric distribution with a power-law density\nslope of ~ -2 and shows no tidal tails within ~200pc from NGC 1851. We show\nthat two GCs can merge with each other to form a new nuclear GC embedded in\nfield stars owing to the low stellar velocity dispersion of the host dwarf.\nThis result makes no assumption on the ages and/or chemical abundances of the\ntwo merging GCs. Thus the observed stellar halo and characteristic multiple\nstellar populations in NGC 1851 suggest that NGC 1851 could have formed\ninitially in the central region of an ancient dwarf galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 02:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging\nSpectrometer (ACIS) imaging of a nearby suspected pulsar and time-variable\ngamma-ray source (GeV J1809-2327) detected 21 X-ray sources in the cluster\nvicinity, some of which are coincident with the early-type stars and H-alpha\nemitters in IC 1274.

It is known that detection of a single supermassive cluster at a very\nhigh redshift can rule out many cosmological models all together. However,\nsince dealing with different observational biases makes it difficult to test\nthe likeliness of the data assuming a cosmological model, most of the cluster\ndata (except those with high mass-redshift) stays untouched in confronting\ncosmological models with cluster observations. We propose here that one can use\nthe relative abundance of the clusters with different masses at different\nredshifts to test the likeliness of the data in the context of cosmological\nmodels. For this purpose we propose a simple parametric form for the efficiency\nof observing clusters at different mass-redshift and we test if the standard\nLCDM model can explain the observed abundance of the clusters using this\nefficiency parameterization. We argue that one cannot expect an unusual and\nhighly parametric form of the efficiency function to fit the observed data\nassuming a theoretical model. Using many realizations of Monte Carlo\nsimulations we show that the standard spatially flat LCDM model is barely\nconsistent with the SPT cluster data using a simple and plausible\ntwo-dimensional efficiency function for detection of the clusters. More cluster\ndata are needed to make any strong conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 07:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-22"}

Previous spectroscopic\nobservations of vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) lines have revealed a persistent\naverage wavelength shift of lines formed at temperatures up to 1 MK. At higher\ntemperatures, the behaviour is still essentially unknown. Here we analyse\ncombined SUMER/SoHO and EIS/Hinode observations of the quiet Sun around disk\ncentre to determine, for the first time, the average Doppler shift of several\nspectral lines formed between 1 and 2 MK, where the largest part of the quiet\ncoronal emission is formed. The measurements are based on a novel technique\napplied to EIS spectra to measure the difference in Doppler shift between lines\nformed at different temperatures. Simultaneous wavelength-calibrated SUMER\nspectra allow establishing the absolute value at the reference temperature of 1\nMK. The average line shifts at 1 MK < T < 1.8 MK are modestly, but clearly\nbluer than those observed at 1 MK. By accepting an average blue shift of about\n(-1.8+/-0.6) km/s at 1 MK (as provided by SUMER measurements), this translates\ninto a maximum Doppler shift of (-4.4+/-2.2) km/s around 1.8 MK. The measured\nvalue appears to decrease to about (-1.3+/-2.6) km/s at the Fe XV formation\ntemperature of 2.1 MK. The measured average Doppler shift between 0.01 and 2.1\nMK, for which we provide a parametrisation, appears to be qualitatively and\nroughly quantitatively consistent with what foreseen by 3-D coronal models\nwhere heating is produced by dissipation of currents induced by photospheric\nmotions and by reconnection with emerging magnetic flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 09:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-22"}

It has been suggested that these\nevents correspond to \"naked\" bursts that occur in a very low density\nenvironment. We reconsider this possibility in the context of various scenarios\nfor the origin of the afterglow. In the standard model where the afterglow\nresults from the forward shock as well as in the alternative model where the\nafterglow comes from the reverse shock, we aim to obtain constraints on the\ndensity of the environment, the microphysics parameters, or the Lorentz factor\nof the ejecta, which are imposed by the absence of a detected afterglow.

Drawing-induced elongation of the Mg particles led, after HT, to a\ntextured macrostructure consisting of elongated polycrystalline MgB2 fibers\nseparated by elongated pores. The superconducting Tc, Jc and Fp were correlated\nwith the macrostructure and grain size. Grain size increased with HT time at\nboth 600C and 700C. Jc and hence Fp decreased monotonically but not linearly\nwith grain size. Overall, it was observed that at 700C, the MgB2 reaction was\nmore or less complete after as little as 30 min; at 600C, full reaction\ncompletion did not occur until 71 h. into the HT. Transport, Jct(B) was\nmeasured in a perpendicular applied field, and the magnetic critical current\ndensities, Jcm\\bot(B) and Jcm{\\phi}(B), were measured in perpendicular and\nparallel (axial) applied fields, respectively. Particularly noticeable was the\npremature dropoff of Jcm\\bot(B) at fields well below the irreversibility field\nof Jct(B). This effect is attributed to the fibrous macrostructure and its\naccompanying anisotropic connectivity. Magnetic measurements with the field\ndirected along the strand axis yielded a critical density, Jcm\\bot(B), for\ncurrent flowing transversely to the strand axis that was less than and dropped\noff more rapidly than Jct(B).

The two messages of this paper are: (i) dynamic\nprogramming (DP) is a useful framework for adaptive radiation therapy,\nparticularly adaptive fractionation, because it allows us to assess how close\nto optimal different methods are, and (ii) heuristic methods proposed in this\npaper are near-optimal, and therefore, can be used to evaluate the best\npossible benefit of using an adaptive fraction size.\n  The essence of adaptive fractionation is to increase the fraction size when\nthe tumor and organ-at-risk (OAR) are far apart (a \"favorable\" anatomy) and to\ndecrease the fraction size when they are close together. Given that a fixed\nprescribed dose must be delivered to the tumor over the course of the\ntreatment, such an approach results in a lower cumulative dose to the OAR when\ncompared to that resulting from standard fractionation. We first establish a\nbenchmark by using the DP algorithm to solve the problem exactly. In this case,\nwe characterize the structure of an optimal policy, which provides guidance for\nour choice of heuristics. We develop two intuitive, numerically near-optimal\nheuristic policies, which could be used for more complex, high-dimensional\nproblems. Furthermore, one of the heuristics requires only a statistic of the\nmotion probability distribution, making it a reasonable method for use in a\nrealistic setting. Numerically, we find that the amount of decrease in dose to\nthe OAR can vary significantly (5 - 85%) depending on the amount of motion in\nthe anatomy, the number of fractions, and the range of fraction sizes allowed.\nIn general, the decrease in dose to the OAR is more pronounced when: (i) we\nhave a high probability of large tumor-OAR distances, (ii) we use many\nfractions (as in a hyper-fractionated setting), and (iii) we allow large daily\nfraction size deviations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 13:35:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 02:28:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2011 05:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-16"}

In this paper, a distributed recursive least-squares\n(D-RLS) algorithm is developed for cooperative estimation using ad hoc wireless\nsensor networks. Distributed iterations are obtained by minimizing a separable\nreformulation of the exponentially-weighted least-squares cost, using the\nalternating-minimization algorithm. Sensors carry out reduced-complexity tasks\nlocally, and exchange messages with one-hop neighbors to consent on the\nnetwork-wide estimates adaptively. A steady-state mean-square error (MSE)\nperformance analysis of D-RLS is conducted, by studying a stochastically-driven\n`averaged' system that approximates the D-RLS dynamics asymptotically in time.\nFor sensor observations that are linearly related to the time-invariant\nparameter vector sought, the simplifying independence setting assumptions\nfacilitate deriving accurate closed-form expressions for the MSE steady-state\nvalues. The problems of mean- and MSE-sense stability of D-RLS are also\ninvestigated, and easily-checkable sufficient conditions are derived under\nwhich a steady-state is attained. Without resorting to diminishing step-sizes\nwhich compromise the tracking ability of D-RLS, stability ensures that per\nsensor estimates hover inside a ball of finite radius centered at the true\nparameter vector, with high-probability, even when inter-sensor communication\nlinks are noisy. Interestingly, computer simulations demonstrate that the\ntheoretical findings are accurate also in the pragmatic settings whereby\nsensors acquire temporally-correlated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 22:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}
