Hence, it is crucial\nto study the radiative transfer of both Lya and continuum photons in the\ncontext of galaxy formation and evolution in order to understand the nature of\ndistant galaxies. Here, we present a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative\ntransfer code, All-wavelength Radiative Transfer with Adaptive Refinement Tree\n(ART^2), which couples Lya line and multi-wavelength continuum, for the study\nof panchromatic properties of galaxies and interstellar medium. This code is\nbased on the original version of Li et al., and features three essential\nmodules: continuum emission from X-ray to radio, Lya emission from both\nrecombination and collisional excitation, and ionization of neutral hydrogen.\nThe coupling of these three modules, together with an adaptive refinement grid,\nenables a self-consistent and accurate calculation of the Lya properties. As an\nexample, we apply ART^2 to a cosmological simulation that includes both star\nformation and black hole growth, and study in detail a sample of massive\ngalaxies at redshifts z=3.1 - 10.2.

Assuming 3-D image features are tracked via a standard\ntracker, the algorithm first utilizes Robust PCA to initialize a low-rank shape\nrepresentation of the rigid body.

Our sample consists of 679 rest-frame-UV\nselected galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that have impact parameters < 2\n(proper) Mpc to the line of sight of one of 15 bright, background QSOs. We\npresent the first 2-D maps of the absorption around galaxies, plotting the\nmedian Ly-a pixel optical depth as a function of transverse and line of sight,\nLOS, separation from galaxies. The median optical depth, and hence the median\ndensity of atomic hydrogen, drops by more than an order of magnitude around 100\nkpc, which is similar to the virial radius of the halos thought to host the\ngalaxies. The median remains enhanced (>3 sigma level) out to at least 2.8 Mpc\n(i.e. > 9 comoving Mpc). Within 100 (200) kpc, and over \\pm 165 km/s, the\ncovering fraction of gas with Ly-a optical depth greater than unity is\n100(+0)(-32)% (86(+14)(-18)%). Absorbers with tau(Ly-a)> 0.1 are typically\ncloser to galaxies than random. The mean galaxy overdensity around absorbers\nincreases with the optical depth and also as the length scale over which the\ngalaxy overdensity is evaluated is decreased.

Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and\ncorrect errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting\ncodes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a\none-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single\nphase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code\nused [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by\nencoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all\nthree qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by\nreversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a\nthree-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the\ncode can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process\nshould decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the\ncorrecting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional NOT (CCNot) or\nToffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single\nqubit, in 63 ns. We find 85\\pm1% fidelity to the expected classical action of\nthis gate and 78\\pm1% fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using it,\nwe perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction\nwith 76\\pm0.5% process fidelity and demonstrate the predicted first-order\ninsensitivity to errors. Concatenating these two codes and performing them on a\nnine-qubit device would correct arbitrary single-qubit errors. When combined\nwith recent advances in superconducting qubit coherence times [5,6], this may\nlead to scalable quantum technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 20:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-24"}

Local sensing model information\nis only partially available at the agents and inter-agent communication is\nassumed to be unpredictable. The paper develops a generic mixed time-scale\nstochastic procedure consisting of simultaneous distributed learning and\nestimation, in which the agents adaptively assess their relative observation\nquality over time and fuse the innovations accordingly. Under rather weak\nassumptions on the statistical model and the inter-agent communication, it is\nshown that, by properly tuning the consensus potential with respect to the\ninnovation potential, the asymptotic information rate loss incurred in the\nlearning process may be made negligible. As such, it is shown that the agent\nestimates are asymptotically efficient, in that their asymptotic covariance\ncoincides with that of a centralized estimator (the inverse of the centralized\nFisher information rate for Gaussian systems) with perfect global model\ninformation and having access to all observations at all times. The proof\ntechniques are mainly based on convergence arguments for non-Markovian mixed\ntime scale stochastic approximation procedures. Several approximation results\ndeveloped in the process are of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 21:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 15:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

To discover the manifold structure of\nmidlevel features, we develop a spectral embedding approach to latent semantic\nlearning based on L1-graph, without the need to tune any parameter for graph\nconstruction as a key step of manifold learning. More importantly, we construct\nthe L1-graph with structured sparse representation, which can be obtained by\nstructured sparse coding with its structured sparsity ensured by novel L1-norm\nhypergraph regularization over mid-level features. In the new embedding space,\nwe learn latent semantics automatically from abundant mid-level features\nthrough spectral clustering. The learnt latent semantics can be readily used\nfor human action recognition with SVM by defining a histogram intersection\nkernel. Different from the traditional latent semantic analysis based on topic\nmodels, our latent semantic learning method can explore the manifold structure\nof mid-level features in both L1-graph construction and spectral embedding,\nwhich results in compact but discriminative high-level features. The\nexperimental results on the commonly used KTH action dataset and unconstrained\nYouTube action dataset show the superior performance of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 00:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We assume that the weights are independent random\nvariables with a given mean and variance for two reasons stemming from\npractical applications: (i) It is usually not known in practice how to choose\nthe weights. Thus by assuming that the weights are random variables, we obtain\nrobust constructions (with respect to the weights) of lattice rules. This, to\nsome extend, removes the necessity to carefully choose the weights. (ii) In\npractice it is convenient to use the same lattice rule for many different\nintegrands. The best choice of weights for each integrand may vary to some\ndegree, hence considering the weights random variables does justice to how\nlattice rules are used in applications.\n  We also study a generalized version which uses $r$ constraints which we call\nthe cbc$r$c (component-by-component with $r$ constraints) algorithm. We show\nthat lattice rules generated by the cbc$r$c algorithm simultaneously work well\nfor all weights in a subspace spanned by the chosen weights\n$\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^{(1)},..., \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^{(r)}$. Thus, in\napplications, instead of finding one set of weights, it is enough to find an\n$r$ dimensional convex polytope in which the optimal weights lie. The price for\nthis method is a factor $r$ in the upper bound on the error and in the\nconstruction cost of the lattice rule. Thus the burden of determining one set\nof weights very precisely can be shifted to the construction of good lattice\nrules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 04:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-26"}

This flip-flop\nscenario would explain the system's behavior where a recurrent TeV emission was\nseen appearing near apastron only, the anti-correlation of GeV and TeV\nemission, and the long-term TeV variability (which seems correlated to LS I +61\n303's super-orbital period), including the appearance of a low TeV-state.\nFinally, we qualitatively put the multi-wavelength phenomenology in context of\nour proposed model, and make some predictions for further testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 06:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The model takes\ninto account thermal conduction and radiative cooling; the pre-explosion system\nconditions included the companion star and a circumbinary density enhancement.\nThe simulations showed that the blast and the ejecta distribution are both\naspherical due to the inhomogeneous circumstellar medium in which they expand;\nin particular they are significantly collimated in polar directions (producing\na bipolar shock morphology) if the circumstellar envelope is characterized by\nan equatorial density enhancement. The blast is partially shielded by the Mira\ncompanion, producing a wake with dense and hot post-shock plasma on the rear\nside of the companion star; most of the X-ray emission produced during the\nevolution of the blast arises from this plasma structure. The observed X-ray\nlightcurve can be reproduced, assuming values of outburst energy and ejected\nmass similar to those of RS Oph and U Sco, if a circumbinary gas density\nenhancement is included in the model.

We model the reionization using a radiative\ntransfer (RT) code coupled to the combined gravity hydrodynamics code Enzo.\nNeutral hydrogen and helium are initially ionized by a starburst spectrum,\nwhich is allowed to gradually evolve into a power law spectrum over the\nredshift interval 3 < z < 4. The temperature-density relation of the gas is\nfound to fan out and flatten following HeII reionization, with an inversion for\noverdensities above 5. Peculiar velocities of up to 10 km/s are induced by the\nincreased pressure, with the gas density field distorted over large coherent\nregions by 10-20%, and the dark matter by levels of 1%. The\nphotoionization-induced flows may thus distort the matter power spectrum at\ncomoving wavenumbers k > 0.5 h/Mpc by a few percent by z = 2. Absorption\nspectra for HI and HeII are drawn from the simulations, and absorption lines\nare fit to the spectra. A median Doppler parameter of 35 km/s is obtained for\nthe HI absorption systems at z = 3. Dividing into subsamples optically thick\nand optically thin at line centre reveals that the optically thick systems\nundergo only mild evolution while the optically thin systems evolve rapidly\nfollowing HeII reionization. A comparison between HeII and HI absorption\nfeatures shows a broad distribution in the HeII and HI column density ratio,\npeaking near the measured value and only slightly narrower than measured. A\ncomparison with approximate simulation methods shows moderately good agreement\nin the absorption line properties, but not to the precision to which they may\nbe measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 11:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The IR-finite part of an\namplitude in different regularizations generally differs by an additive\nconstant at each loop order, due to the ambiguity in separating finite and\ndivergent contributions. We give a prescription for defining an unambiguous,\nregulator-independent finite part of the amplitude by factoring off a product\nof IR-divergent \"wedge\" functions. For the cases of dimensional regularization\nand the common-mass Higgs regulator, we define the wedge function in terms of a\nform factor, and demonstrate the regularization independence of the n-point\namplitude through two loops. We also deduce the form of the wedge function for\nthe more general differential-mass Higgs regulator, although we lack an\nexplicit operator definition in this case. Finally, using extended dual\nconformal symmetry, we demonstrate the link between the differential-mass wedge\nfunction and the anomalous dual conformal Ward identity for the finite part of\nthe scattering amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 12:50:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 19:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The RVs\nwere derived based on the high resolution echelle spectra taken between 2004\nand 2008 with the Keck I/HIRES, Shane/CAT/HamSpec and TNG/SARG\ntelescopes/spectrographs using our novel iodine-cell technique for double-lined\nbinary stars. The RVs and available PTI astrometric data spanning over 8 years\nallow us to reach 0.2-0.5% level of precision in M sin3(i) and the parallax but\nthe geometry of the orbit (i=154 deg) hampers the absolute mass precision to\n3.3%, which is still an order of magnitude better than for previous studies. We\ncompare our results with a set of Yonsei-Yale theoretical stellar isochrones\nand conclude that BY Dra is probably a main sequence system more metal-rich\nthan the Sun. Using the orbital inclination and the available rotational\nvelocities of the components, we also conclude that the rotational axes of the\ncomponents are likely misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. Given BY\nDra's main sequence status, late spectral type and the relatively short orbital\nperiod, its high orbital eccentricity and probable spin-orbit misalignment are\nnot in agreement with the tidal theory. This disagreement may possibly be\nexplained by smaller rotational velocities of the components and the presence\nof a substellar mass companion to BY Dra AB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 12:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Using approximately 6,100 photospheric\nspectral lines covering the visible domain, we employed a cross-correlation\nprocedure to compute a mean polarized line profile from each spectrum. The\nlarge-scale photospheric magnetic field of the star was then modelled by means\nof Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, allowing us to follow the year-to-year evolution of\nthe reconstructed magnetic topology.

The\nresults obtained allow us to estimate the stored energy of the wind field in\nthe Indian Ocean, its climate variability, and distribution of the above\nstatistical characteristics of wind field in the Indian Ocean.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 13:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-26"}

The high sensitivity of methanol\noriginates from the interplay between overall rotation and hindered internal\nrotation of the molecule -- i.e. transitions that convert internal rotation\nenergy into overall rotation energy, or vice versa, give rise to an enhancement\nof the sensitivity coefficient, $K_{\\mu}$. As internal rotation is a common\nphenomenon in polyatomic molecules, it is likely that other molecules display\nsimilar or even larger effects. In this paper we generalize the concepts that\nform the foundation of the high sensitivity in methanol and use this to\nconstruct an approximate model which allows to estimate the sensitivities of\ntransitions in internal rotor molecules with $C_{3v}$ symmetry, without\nperforming a full calculation of energy levels. We find that a reliable\nestimate of transition sensitivities can be obtained from the three rotational\nconstants ($A$, $B$, and $C$) and three torsional constants ($F$, $V_3$ and\n$\\rho$). This model is verified by comparing obtained sensitivities for\nmethanol, acetaldehyde, acetamide, methyl formate and acetic acid with a full\nanalysis of the molecular Hamiltonian.

However, this kind of\nrepresentation can be quite restrictive and, in many cases, it requires more\ncomplex structures in order to represent data in a more natural way. Terms are\nthe basis for functional and logic programming representation. Distances\nbetween terms are a useful tool not only to compare terms, but also to\ndetermine the search space in many of these applications. This dissertation\napplies distances between terms, exploiting the features of each distance and\nthe possibility to compare from propositional data types to hierarchical\nrepresentations. The distances between terms are applied through the k-NN\n(k-nearest neighbor) classification algorithm using XML as a common language\nrepresentation. To be able to represent these data in an XML structure and to\ntake advantage of the benefits of distance between terms, it is necessary to\napply some transformations. These transformations allow the conversion of flat\ndata into hierarchical data represented in XML, using some techniques based on\nintuitive associations between the names and values of variables and\nassociations based on attribute similarity.\n  Several experiments with the distances between terms of Nienhuys-Cheng and\nEstruch et al. were performed. In the case of originally propositional data,\nthese distances are compared to the Euclidean distance. In all cases, the\nexperiments were performed with the distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor\nalgorithm, using several exponents for the attraction function (weighted\ndistance). It can be seen that in some cases, the term distances can\nsignificantly improve the results on approaches applied to flat\nrepresentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 13:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-26"}

Given the paucity of 8 GHz observations over large angular\nscales and the clear evidence for non-power law Galactic emission near 8 GHz, a\nnew analysis of Conklin's data is informative. In this paper we compare\nConklin's data to that from Haslam et al. (0.4 GHz), Reich and Reich (1.4 GHz),\nand WMAP (23-94 GHz). We show that the spectral index between Conklin's data\nand the 23 GHz WMAP data is beta=-1.7+-0.1, where we model the emission\ntemperature as T \\propto nu^beta. Free-free emission has beta \\approx -2.15,\nsynchrotron emission has beta \\approx -2.7 to -3. Thermal dust emission (beta\n\\approx1.7) is negligible at 8 GHz. We conclude that there must be another\ndistinct non-power law component of diffuse foreground emission that emits near\n10 GHz, consistent with other observations in this frequency range. By\ncomparing to the full complement of data sets, we show that a model with an\nanomalous emission component, assumed to be spinning dust, is preferred over a\nmodel without spinning dust at 5 sigma (Delta chi2= 31). However, the source of\nthe new component cannot be determined uniquely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 14:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Motivated by the observational sample, this paper studies\nthe accretion of rocky planets by Hot Jupiters, after the Jovian planets have\nfinished their principal migration epoch and become parked in $\\sim4$-day\norbits. In this scenario, rocky planets form later and then migrate inward due\nto torques from the remaining circumstellar disk, which also damps the orbital\neccentricity. This mechanism thus represents one possible channel for\nincreasing the core masses and metallicities of Hot Jupiters. This paper\ndetermines probabilities for the possible end states for the rocky planet:\ncollisions with the Jovian planets, accretion onto the star, ejection from the\nsystem, and long-term survival of both planets. These probabilities depend on\nthe mass of the Jovian planet and its starting orbital eccentricity, as well as\nthe eccentricity damping rate for the rocky planet. Since these systems are\nhighly chaotic, a large ensemble ($N\\sim10^3$) of simulations with effectively\nequivalent starting conditions is required. Planetary collisions are common\nwhen the eccentricity damping rate is sufficiently low, but are rare otherwise.\nFor systems that experience planetary collisions, this work determines the\ndistributions of impact velocities -- both speeds and impact parameters -- for\nthe collisions. These velocity distributions help determine the consequences of\nthe impacts, e.g., where energy and heavy elements are deposited within the\ngiant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 15:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

These are\nimportant for many experiments including 3D diffraction imaging. We discuss the\nimplementation of a single-crystal self-seeding scheme in the hard X-ray lines\nof the European XFEL. For this facility, transform-limited pulses are\nparticularly valuable since they naturally support the extraction of more FEL\npower than at saturation by exploiting tapering in the tunable-gap baseline\nundulators. Tapering consists of a stepwise change of the undulator gap from\nsegment to segment. Based on start-to-end simulations dealing with the\nup-to-date parameters of the European XFEL, we show that the FEL power reaches\nabout 400 GW, or one order of magnitude higher power than the SASE saturation\nlevel (20 GW). This analysis indicates that our self-seeding scheme is not\nsignificantly affected by non-ideal electron phase-space distribution, and\nyields about the same performance as in the case for an electron beam with\nideal parameters. The self-seeding scheme with a single crystal monochromator\nis extremely compact (about 5 m long), and cost estimations are low enough to\nconsider adding it to the European XFEL capabilities from the very beginning of\nthe operation phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 15:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-26"}

By generalizing this idea and by combining\nit with a non-standard variant of the Central Limit Theorem, a constant-time or\nO(1) algorithm was proposed in [Chaudhury2010] that allowed one to perform\nspace-variant filtering using Gaussian-like kernels. The algorithm was based on\nthe observation that both isotropic and anisotropic Gaussians could be\napproximated using certain bivariate splines called box splines. The attractive\nfeature of the algorithm was that it allowed one to continuously control the\nshape and size (covariance) of the filter, and that it had a fixed\ncomputational cost per pixel, irrespective of the size of the filter. The\nalgorithm, however, offered a limited control on the covariance and accuracy of\nthe Gaussian approximation. In this work, we propose some improvements by\nappropriately modifying the algorithm in [Chaudhury2010].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 15:43:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 00:42:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 18:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
