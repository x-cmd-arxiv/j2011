However, in the event of a merger,\ngravitational-wave (GW) recoil may displace a SMBH from its galactic center, or\neject it entirely. To explore the consequences of this phenomenon, we use\nhydrodynamic simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers that include a range of BH\nrecoil velocities. We have generated a suite of over 200 simulations with more\nthan 60 merger models, enabling us to identify systematic trends in the\nbehavior of recoiling BHs -- specifically (i) their dynamics, (ii) their\nobservable signatures, and (iii) their effects on BH/galaxy co-evolution. (i)\nRecoiling BH trajectories depend heavily on the gas content of the host galaxy;\nmaximal BH displacements from the center may vary by up to an order of\nmagnitude between gas-rich and gas-poor mergers. In some cases, recoil\ntrajectories also depend on the timing of the BH merger relative to the\nformation of the galaxy merger remnant. (ii) Recoiling BHs may be observable as\noffset active galactic nuclei (AGN) via either kinematic offsets (v > 800 km\ns^-1) or spatial offsets (R > 1 kpc) for lifetimes of about 1 - 100 Myr. In\naddition, recoil events affect the total AGN lifetime. GW recoil generally\nreduces the lifetimes of bright AGN, but may extend lower-luminosity AGN\nlifetimes. (iii) Rapidly-recoiling BHs may be up to about 5 times less massive\nthan their stationary counterparts. These mass deficits lower the normalization\nof the M - sigma relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter.\nFurthermore, recoil events displace AGN feedback from the galactic center,\nwhich enhances central star formation rates. This results in longer starburst\nphases and higher central stellar densities in merger remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 16:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

In such galactic environments, a\nvariety of feedback processes can play a significant role in shaping the\ninitial mass function (IMF). Here, we present a numerical study on the effects\nof an accreting black hole and the influence of nearby massive stars to a\ncollapsing, 800 M_sun, molecular cloud at 10 pc distance from the black hole.\nWe parametrize and study radiative feedback effects of hard X-rays emanating\nfrom the black hole broad line region, increased cosmic ray rates due to\nsupernovae in starbursts, and strong UV radiation produced by nearby massive\nstars. We also investigate the importance of shear from the supermassive,\n10^6-10^8 M_sun, black hole as the star-forming cloud orbits around it. We find\nthat thermal pressure from X-rays compresses the cloud, which induces a high\nstar formation rate early on, but reduces the overall star formation efficiency\nto about 7% due to gas depletion by evaporation. We see that the turn-over mass\nof the IMF increases up to a factor of 2.3, M_turn = 1-1.5 M_sun, for the model\nwith the highest X-ray flux (160 erg s^-1 cm^-2), while the high-mass slope of\nthe IMF becomes Gamma > -1. This results in more high mass stars and a\nnon-Salpeter IMF. Cosmic rays penetrate deeply into the cloud and increase the\ngas temperature (50-200 K), which leads to a reduced formation efficiency of\nlow mass stars. High cosmic ray rates increase the average mass of stars,\nthereby shifting the turn-over mass to higher values, i.e., up to several solar\nmasses. Due to this process, the onset of star formation is also delayed. We\nconclude that the IMF inside active galaxies is different than the one obtained\nfrom local environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 17:08:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 13:36:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2011 12:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

After each flight, end-to-end radiometric\ncalibrations of the rocket payload were carried out in the same facility used\nfor pre-launch calibrations of CDS and EIS. During the 2007 flight, EUNIS, SOHO\nCDS and Hinode EIS observed the same solar locations, allowing the EUNIS\ncalibrations to be directly applied to both CDS and EIS. The measured CDS NIS 1\nline intensities calibrated with the standard (version 4) responsivities with\nthe standard long-term corrections are found to be too low by a factor of 1.5\ndue to the decrease in responsivity. The EIS calibration update is performed in\ntwo ways. One is using the direct calibration transfer of the calibrated\nEUNIS-07 short wavelength (SW) channel. The other is using the insensitive line\npairs, in which one member was observed by EUNIS-07 long wavelength (LW)\nchannel and the other by EIS in either LW or SW waveband. Measurements from\nboth methods are in good agreement, and confirm (within the measurement\nuncertainties) the EIS responsivity measured directly before the instrument's\nlaunch. The measurements also suggest that the EIS responsivity decreased by a\nfactor of about 1.2 after the first year of operation. The shape of the EIS SW\nresponse curve obtained by EUNIS-07 is consistent with the one measured in\nlaboratory prior to launch. The absolute value of the quiet-Sun He II 304 A\nintensity measured by EUNIS-07 is consistent with the radiance measured by CDS\nNIS in quiet regions near the disk center and the solar minimum irradiance\nobtained by CDS NIS and SDO/EVE recently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 17:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The effect of a\nvariety of parameters was investigated, including the capillary number,\nrigidity ratio between the two species, volume fraction, confinement ratio, and\nthe number fraction of the more floppy particle $X_f$ in the mixture. It was\nobserved that in suspensions of pure species, the mean wall normal positions of\nthe stiff and the floppy particles are comparable.

It is known that $k$-D'Atri spaces, $k\\geq 1,$ are related\nto properties of Jacobi operators $R_{v}$ along geodesics, since she has shown\nthat ${\\operatorname{tr}}R_{v}$, ${\\operatorname{tr}}R_{v}^{2}$ are invariant\nunder the geodesic flow for any unit tangent vector $v$. Here, assuming that\nthe Riemannian manifold is a D'Atri space, we prove in our main result that\n${\\operatorname{tr}}R_{v}^{3}$ is also invariant under the geodesic flow if $\nk\\geq 3$. In addition, other properties of Jacobi operators related to the\nLedger conditions are obtained and they are used to give applications to\nIwasawa type spaces. In the class of D'Atri spaces of Iwasawa type, we show two\ndifferent characterizations of the symmetric spaces of noncompact type: they\nare exactly the $\\frak{C}$-spaces and on the other hand they are $k$ -D'Atri\nspaces for some $k\\geq 3.$ In the last case, they are $k$-D'Atri for all\n$k=1,...,n-1$ as well. In particular, Damek-Ricci spaces that are $k$-D'Atri\nfor some $k\\geq 3$ are symmetric.\n  Finally, we characterize $k$-D'Atri spaces for all $k=1,...,n-1$ as the $%\n\\frak{SC}$-spaces (geodesic symmetries preserve the principal curvatures of\nsmall geodesic spheres). Moreover, applying this result in the case of 4%\n-dimensional homogeneous spaces we prove that the properties of being a D'Atri\n(1-D'Atri) space, or a 3-D'Atri space, are equivalent to the property of being\na $k$-D'Atri space for all $k=1,2,3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 18:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 08:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-18"}

A primary focus\nof joint radio and hard X-ray studies of solar flares uses observations of\nnonthermal gyrosynchrotron emission at radio wavelengths and bremsstrahlung\nhard X-rays to study the properties of electrons accelerated in the main flare\nsite, since it is well established that these two emissions show very similar\ntemporal behavior. A quantitative prescription is given for comparing the\nelectron energy distributions derived separately from the two wavelength\nranges: this is an important application with the potential for measuring the\nmagnetic field strength in the flaring region, and reveals significant\ndifferences between the electrons in different energy ranges. Examples of the\nuse of simultaneous data from the two wavelength ranges to derive physical\nconditions are then discussed, including the case of microflares, and the\ncomparison of images at radio and hard X-ray wavelengths is presented. There\nhave been puzzling results obtained from observations of solar flares at\nmillimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, and the comparison of these results\nwith corresponding hard X-ray data is presented. Finally, the review discusses\nthe association of hard X-ray releases with radio emission at decimeter and\nmeter wavelengths, which is dominated by plasma emission (at lower frequencies)\nand electron cyclotron maser emission (at higher frequencies), both coherent\nemission mechanisms that require small numbers of energetic electrons. These\ncomparisons show broad general associations but detailed correspondence remains\nmore elusive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 19:17:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2011 19:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In a\nself-oscillator, the driving force is controlled by the oscillation itself so\nthat it acts in phase with the velocity, causing a negative damping that feeds\nenergy into the vibration: no external rate needs to be adjusted to the\nresonant frequency. The famous collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge in 1940,\noften attributed by introductory physics texts to forced resonance, was\nactually a self-oscillation, as was the swaying of the London Millennium\nFootbridge in 2000. Clocks are self-oscillators, as are bowed and wind musical\ninstruments.

We show here that the original Map\ncoding scheme, which is both block-averaged and one-step, neglects the internal\nstructure of the communities and introduces an upper scale, the `field-of-view'\nlimit, in the communities it can detect. As a consequence, Map is well tuned to\ndetect clique-like communities but can lead to undesirable overpartitioning\nwhen communities are far from clique-like. We show that a signature of this\nbehavior is a large compression gap: the Map description length is far from its\nideal limit. To address this issue, we propose a simple dynamic approach that\nintroduces time explicitly into the Map coding through the analysis of the\nweighted adjacency matrix of the time-dependent multistep transition matrix of\nthe Markov process. The resulting Markov time sweeping induces a dynamical\nzooming across scales that can reveal (potentially multiscale) community\nstructure above the field-of-view limit, with the relevant partitions indicated\nby a small compression gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 19:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 15:14:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 10:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We find a redshift dependence of this blueing in a\ngiven set of bands (e.g. g and r), but show that it is the result of the flux\ncontribution from less-variable or delayed emission lines in the different SDSS\nbands at different redshifts. After correcting for this effect, quasar\ncolor-variability is remarkably uniform, and independent not only of redshift,\nbut also of quasar luminosity and black hole mass. The color variations of\nindividual quasars, as they vary in brightness on year timescales, are much\nmore pronounced than the ranges in color seen in samples of quasars across many\norders of magnitude in luminosity. This indicates distinct physical mechanisms\nbehind quasar variability and the observed range of quasar luminosities at a\ngiven black hole mass - quasar variations cannot be explained by changes in the\nmean accretion rate. We do find some dependence of the color variability on the\ncharacteristics of the flux variations themselves, with fast, low-amplitude,\nbrightness variations producing more color variability. The observed behavior\ncould arise if quasar variability results from flares or ephemeral hot spots in\nan accretion disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2011 13:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Although the mean biases are small and mostly\n<1%, the flattest cluster models generally have a significant mean bias; i.e.,\naveraging over all orientations does not always eliminate projection biases.\nSubstantial biases can result from different viewing orientations, where the\nintegrated Compton-y parameter (Y_SZ) and the concentration have the largest\nscatter (as large as sigma ~10% for Y_SZ), and the emission-weighted\ntemperature (T_X) has the smallest (sigma < ~0.5%). The very small scatter for\nT_X leads to Y_X and M_gas having virtually the same orientation biases.\nSubstantial scatter is expected for individual clusters (up to sigma ~8%) in\nthe correlation between Y_SZ and Y_X in comparison to the small mean bias\n(sigma < ~1%) applicable to a random sample of clusters of sufficient size. For\nellipsoidal NFW models we show that the orientation bias for the total cluster\nmass attains a minimum near the radius r_2500 so that the spherically averaged\nmass computed at this radius is always within ~0.5% of the true value for any\norientation. Finally, to facilitate the accounting for orientation bias in\nX-ray and SZ cluster studies, we provide cubic polynomial approximations to the\nmean orientation bias and 1-sigma scatter for each cluster observable as a\nfunction of axial ratio for the ellipsoidal NFW models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 20:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 19:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

In the model, a density\ndistribution function is used to simulate the flow field, while a total energy\ndistribution function is employed to simulate the temperature field. The\ndiscrete equilibrium density and total energy distribution functions are\nobtained from the Hermite expansions of the corresponding continuous\nequilibrium distribution functions. The pressure given by the equation of state\nof perfect gases is recovered in the macroscopic momentum and energy equations.\nThe coupling between the momentum and energy transports makes the model\napplicable for general thermal flows such as non-Boussinesq flows, while the\nexisting DDF LB models on standard lattices are usually limited to Boussinesq\nflows in which the temperature variation is small. Meanwhile, the simple\nstructure and basic advantages of the DDF LB approach are retained.

The experiment used a time-structured\nlow-energy muon beam and an array of plastic scintillators read-out by waveform\ndigitizers and a fast data acquisition system to record over 2 times 10^{12}\nmuon decays. Two different in-vacuum muon-stopping targets were used in\nseparate data-taking periods. The results from these two data-taking periods\nare in excellent agreement.

The NIR photons are produced by nonthermal\nsynchrotron processes, but we still don't completely understand where or why\nthese flares originate, nor exactly how the X-rays are emitted. The power-law\nelectrons radiating the infrared light may be partially cooled, so the\ndistribution may be a broken power law with a (\"cooling break\") transition\nfrequency. In addition, the emission region appears to be rather compact,\npossibly restricted to the inner edge of the accretion disk. In that case, the\nX-ray outburst may itself be due to synchrotron processes by the most energetic\nparticles in this population. In this paper, we examine several key features of\nthis proposal, producing relativistically correct polarimetric images of Sgr\nA*'s NIR and X-ray flare emission, in order to determine (1) whether the\nmeasured NIR polarization fraction is consistent with this geometry, and (2)\nwhether the predicted X-ray to NIR peak fluxes are confirmed by the currently\navailable multi-wavelength observations. We also calculate the X-ray\npolarization fraction and position angle (relative to that of the NIR photons)\nin anticipation of such measurements in the coming years. We show that whereas\nthe polarization fraction and position angle of the X-rays are similar to those\nof the NIR component for synchrotron-cooled emission, these quantities are\nmeasurably different when the X-rays emerge from a scattering medium. It is\nclear, therefore, that the development of X-ray polarimetry will represent a\nmajor new tool for studying the spacetime near supermassive black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 07:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

The first is increased\nfluctuations between the two states of the TLS, the significance of this effect\ncompared to thermal fluctuations depend on the energy splitting of the TLS\ncompared to temperature. The second effect is a reduction in the intensity of\nthe noise spectrum at low frequencies, and at the same time an increase in\nintensity around the renormalized Rabi frequency of the TLS, the driving\nfrequency and at beatings between these two frequencies.

The idea is\nthat a randomized query satisfies differential privacy if the likelihood of\nobtaining a certain answer for a database $x$ is not too different from the\nlikelihood of obtaining the same answer on adjacent databases, i.e. databases\nwhich differ from $x$ for only one individual.

Recent observations of LMC Cepheids bring new constraints on the\nslope of the period-projection factor relation (hereafter Pp relation) that is\ncurrently used in the Baade-Wesselink (hereafter BW) method of distance\ndetermination. The discrepancy between observations and theoretical analysis is\nparticularly significant for short period Cepheids Aims. We investigate three\nphysical effects that might possibly explain this discrepancy: (1) the\nspectroscopic S/N that is systematically lower for LMC Cepheids (around 10)\ncompared to Galactic ones (up to 300), (2) the impact of the metallicity on the\ndynamical structure of LMC Cepheids, and (3) the combination of infrared\nphotometry/interferometry with optical spectroscopy. Methods. To study the S/N\nwe use a very simple toy model of Cepheids. The impact of metallicity on the\nprojection factor is based on the hydrodynamical model of delta Cep already\ndescribed in previous studies. This model is also used to derive the position\nof the optical versus infrared photospheric layers. Results. We find no\nsignificant effect of S/N, metallicity, and optical-versus-infrared\nobservations on the Pp relation. Conclusions. The Pp relation of Cepheids in\nthe LMC does not differ from the Galactic relation. This allows its universal\napplication to determine distances to extragalactic Cepheids via BW analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 09:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-03"}

First, the\nsplitting of laser-induced subwavelength gratings that is experimentally\nevidenced on ZnO, Si, and GaAs, is confirmed to originate in the conversion of\nSP modes from the resonant to the nonresonant mode and further to the inphase\nor antiphase asymmetric mode. Further, as pulse number increases the universal\nscaling-down of laser-induced structures is derived from the conversion of\nphysical regimes of plasmonic interaction from the optical to the electrostatic\nregime, which may arouse quasistatic SPs with interacting scales far beyond the\ndiffraction limit and result in the ultrafast, non-thermal ablation for\nextraordinary electrostatic enhancement. Generally, the plasmonic mechanisms\nreveal the link between the deep-subwavelength space-scale and the ultra-short\ntimescale for ultrafast laser-induced nanostructures: basically, \"nanoscale\"\ntends to eliminate electromagnetic retardation effects and bring an instant\nrespond to the incident field, and arouse electrostatic interactions with giant\nlocal-field enhancement facilitating ultrafast ablation driven by tremendous\nelectrostatic forces. Thus, active plasmonic structures provided with\nsimultaneous \"nanoscale\" and \"ultrafast\" is apt to form in ultrafast ablation.\nIn addition, the plasmonic mechanisms can act as a powerful \"evolutionary\nforce\" acting in multipulse ablation and promoting the growth of resonant\nnanostructures-various typical plasmonic structures may be self-generated\nthrough multipulse evolution, which can be considered as a kind of natural\nplasmonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 10:14:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 May 2012 18:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-29"}

We then present the recent survey of\nSegue 1, considered by many as possibly the most DM dominated satellite galaxy\nknown in our galaxy. No significant gamma-ray emission was found above the\nbackground in around 30 hours of observation. This is the largest survey ever\nmade on a single dwarf by Cherenkov telescopes. We present a novel analysis\nthat fully takes into account the spectral features of the gamma-ray spectrum\nof specific DM models in a Supersymmetric scenario. We also discuss the\nprospects of detection after the Fermi observation of similar objects at lower\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 10:17:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 12:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

However, inertia is absent\nfrom the dynamics of a magnetic dipole (the Landau-Lifshitz equation, the\nGilbert equation and the Bloch equation contain only the first derivative of\nthe magnetization with respect to time). In order to investigate this\nparadoxical situation, the lagrangian approach (proposed originally by T. H.\nGilbert) is revisited keeping an arbitrary nonzero inertial tensor. A dynamic\nequation generalized to the inertial regime is obtained. It is shown how both\nthe usual gyromagnetic relation and the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation are recovered at the kinetic limit, i.e. for time scales above the\nrelaxation time $\\tau$ of the angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 10:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

To deal with such a transformed\nNUM, we leverage Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach to approximate\nthe non-convex problem by a series of convex ones.

The removal of the bulk signal from the host\ngalaxy light is done with the aim of detecting the fainter minor mergers. The\nspecific morphological parameters that are used in the merger diagnostic\nsuggested here are the Residual Flux Fraction and the asymmetry of the\nresiduals. The new diagnostic has been calibrated and optimized so that the\nresulting merger sample is very complete. However, the contamination by\nnon-mergers is also high. If the same optimization method is adopted for\ncombinations of other structural parameters such as the CAS system, the merger\nindicator we introduce yields merger samples of equal or higher statistical\nquality than the samples obtained through the use of other structural\nparameters. We explore the ability of the method presented here to select minor\nmergers by identifying a sample of visually classified mergers that would not\nhave been picked up by the use of the CAS system, when using its usual limits.\nGiven the low prevalence of mergers among the general population of galaxies\nand the optimization used here, we find that the merger diagnostic introduced\nin this work is best used as a negative merger test, i.e., it is very effective\nat selecting non-merging galaxies. As with all the currently available\nautomatic methods, the sample of merger candidates selected is contaminated by\nnon-mergers, and further steps are needed to produce a clean sample. This\nmerger diagnostic has been developed using the HST/ACS F606W images of the\nA901/02 cluster (z=0.165) obtained by the STAGES team. In particular, we have\nfocused on a mass and magnitude limited sample (log M/M_{O}>9.0,\nR_{Vega}<23.5mag)) which includes 905 cluster galaxies and 655 field galaxies\nof all morphological types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 14:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

To minimize the\ndrive energy for ignition, the imploding shell of DT fuel must be kept as cold\nas possible. Such low-adiabat ICF implosions can access to coupled and\ndegenerate plasma conditions, in which the analytical or chemical EOS models\nbecome inaccurate. Using the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations we\nhave derived a first-principles EOS (FPEOS) table of deuterium that covers\ntypical ICF fuel conditions at densities ranging from 0.002 to 1596 g/cm3 and\ntemperatures of 1.35 eV to 5.5 keV.

When compared with the widely used SESAME table and the revised\nKerley03 table, discrepancies in the internal energy and in the pressure are\nidentified for moderately coupled and degenerate plasma conditions. In contrast\nto the SESAME table, the revised Kerley03 table is in better agreement with our\nFPEOS results over a wide range of densities and temperatures. Although subtle\ndifferences still exist for lower temperatures (T < 10 eV) and moderate\ndensities (1 to 10 g/cc), hydrodynamics simulations of cryogenic ICF implosions\nusing the FPEOS table and the Kerley03 table have resulted in similar results\nfor the peak density, areal density ({\\rho}R), and neutron yield, which are\nsignificantly different from the SESAME simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 05:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Ideally, the benchmarks should reflect possible\napplications of the developed technology. In AI Planning, researchers more and\nmore tend to draw their testing examples from the benchmark collections used in\nthe International Planning Competition (IPC). In the organization of (the\ndeterministic part of) the fourth IPC, IPC-4, the authors therefore invested\nsignificant effort to create a useful set of benchmarks. They come from five\ndifferent (potential) real-world applications of planning: airport ground\ntraffic control, oil derivative transportation in pipeline networks,\nmodel-checking safety properties, power supply restoration, and UMTS call\nsetup. Adapting and preparing such an application for use as a benchmark in the\nIPC involves, at the time, inevitable (often drastic) simplifications, as well\nas careful choice between, and engineering of, domain encodings. For the first\ntime in the IPC, we used compilations to formulate complex domain features in\nsimple languages such as STRIPS, rather than just dropping the more interesting\nproblem constraints in the simpler language subsets. The article explains and\ndiscusses the five application domains and their adaptation to form the PDDL\ntest suites used in IPC-4. We summarize known theoretical results on structural\nproperties of the domains, regarding their computational complexity and\nprovable properties of their topology under the h+ function (an idealized\nversion of the relaxed plan heuristic). We present new (empirical) results\nilluminating properties such as the quality of the most wide-spread heuristic\nfunctions (planning graph, serial planning graph, and relaxed plan), the growth\nof propositional representations over instance size, and the number of actions\navailable to achieve each fact; we discuss these data in conjunction with the\nbest results achieved by the different kinds of planners participating in\nIPC-4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 19:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-06"}
