The states due to different\nvalues of the quantum number $(l_z)$ of angular momentum are found to be no\nlonger degenerate as is the case in the conventional theory. The physical\norigin of this elimination of the conventional degeneracy may intuitively be\nattributed to the state-dependent inertial \\emph{broadening} of the rotating\ncharge clouds; the corresponding \\emph{anisotropic} deformation (in the\nquadrupole approximation) lowers then the negative electrostatic interaction\nenergy.

We consider these questions\nin the context of the job-shop scheduling problem (JSP), a domain where tabu\nsearch algorithms have been shown to be remarkably effective. Previously, we\ndemonstrated that the mean distance between random local optima and the nearest\noptimal solution is highly correlated with problem difficulty for a well-known\ntabu search algorithm for the JSP introduced by Taillard. In this paper, we\ndiscuss various shortcomings of this measure and develop a new model of problem\ndifficulty that corrects these deficiencies. We show that Taillards algorithm\ncan be modeled with high fidelity as a simple variant of a straightforward\nrandom walk. The random walk model accounts for nearly all of the variability\nin the cost required to locate both optimal and sub-optimal solutions to random\nJSPs, and provides an explanation for differences in the difficulty of random\nversus structured JSPs. Finally, we discuss and empirically substantiate two\nnovel predictions regarding tabu search algorithm behavior. First, the method\nfor constructing the initial solution is highly unlikely to impact the\nperformance of tabu search. Second, tabu tenure should be selected to be as\nsmall as possible while simultaneously avoiding search stagnation; values\nlarger than necessary lead to significant degradations in performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 20:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

Provably optimal\nsolutions may be desirable for commercial and defense applications.\nAdditionally, for applications such as register allocation and code\noptimization, naturally-occurring instances of graph coloring are often small\nand can be solved optimally. A recent wave of improvements in algorithms for\nBoolean satisfiability (SAT) and 0-1 Integer Linear Programming (ILP) suggests\ngeneric problem-reduction methods, rather than problem-specific heuristics,\nbecause (1) heuristics may be upset by new constraints, (2) heuristics tend to\nignore structure, and (3) many relevant problems are provably inapproximable.\n  Problem reductions often lead to highly symmetric SAT instances, and\nsymmetries are known to slow down SAT solvers. In this work, we compare several\navenues for symmetry breaking, in particular when certain kinds of symmetry are\npresent in all generated instances. Our focus on reducing CSPs to SAT allows us\nto leverage recent dramatic improvement in SAT solvers and automatically\nbenefit from future progress. We can use a variety of black-box SAT solvers\nwithout modifying their source code because our symmetry-breaking techniques\nare static, i.e., we detect symmetries and add symmetry breaking predicates\n(SBPs) during pre-processing.\n  An important result of our work is that among the types of\ninstance-independent SBPs we studied and their combinations, the simplest and\nleast complete constructions are the most effective.

In decision-theoretic planning, where many desirable behaviours are\nmore naturally expressed as properties of execution sequences rather than as\nproperties of states, NMRDPs form a more natural model than the commonly\nadopted fully Markovian decision process (MDP) model. While the more tractable\nsolution methods developed for MDPs do not directly apply in the presence of\nnon-Markovian rewards, a number of solution methods for NMRDPs have been\nproposed in the literature. These all exploit a compact specification of the\nnon-Markovian reward function in temporal logic, to automatically translate the\nNMRDP into an equivalent MDP which is solved using efficient MDP solution\nmethods. This paper presents NMRDPP (Non-Markovian Reward Decision Process\nPlanner), a software platform for the development and experimentation of\nmethods for decision-theoretic planning with non-Markovian rewards. The current\nversion of NMRDPP implements, under a single interface, a family of methods\nbased on existing as well as new approaches which we describe in detail. These\ninclude dynamic programming, heuristic search, and structured methods. Using\nNMRDPP, we compare the methods and identify certain problem features that\naffect their performance. NMRDPPs treatment of non-Markovian rewards is\ninspired by the treatment of domain-specific search control knowledge in the\nTLPlan planner, which it incorporates as a special case. In the First\nInternational Probabilistic Planning Competition, NMRDPP was able to compete\nand perform well in both the domain-independent and hand-coded tracks, using\nsearch control knowledge in the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 21:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

The elementary deformation is the analog\nof a Bernoulli-Navier's displacement for linearized deformations replacing the\ninfinitesimal rotation by a rotation in SO(3) in each cross section of the rod.\nEach part of the decomposition is estimated with respect to the $L^2$ norm of\nthe distance from gradient $v$ to SO(3).

We model the stray\nlight as having two components: a spectrally dispersed component and a\ncomponent of parasitic light caused by scattering inside the spectrograph. We\nuse several measurements to estimate the two contributions: observations with a\n(partly) blocked FOV, a convolution of the FTS spectral atlas, imaging in the\npupil plane, umbral profiles, and spurious polarization signal in telluric\nlines. The measurements allow us to estimate the spatial PSF of POLIS and the\nmain spectrograph of the German VTT. We use the PSF for a deconvolution of both\nspectropolarimetric data and investigate the effect on the spectra. The\nparasitic contribution can be directly and accurately determined for POLIS,\namounting to about 5%. We estimate a lower limit of about 10% across the full\nFOV for the dispersed stray light.

An asymptotic analysis, in the\nlimit of large distances to the wall, allows to approximate the wall effect as\na constant translation of the vortex pair parallel to the wall, plus a\nstraining flow which induces a natural blinking vortex mechanism with period\nhalf the rotation period. A Melnikov analysis of lagrangian particles, in the\nframe translating and rotating with the vortices, shows that a homoclinic\nbifurcation indeed occurs, so that the various separatrices located near the\nvortex pair (and rotating with it) do not survive when a wall is present. The\nthickness of the resulting inner stochastic layer is estimated by using the\nseparatrix map method, and is shown to scale like the inverse of the squared\ndistance to the wall. This estimation provides a lower-bound to the numerical\nthickness measured from either Poincar\\'e sections or simulations of lagrangian\nparticles transported by the exact potential velocity field in the laboratory\nframe. In addition, it is shown that the outer homoclinic cycle, separating the\nvortices from the external (open) flow, is also perturbed from inside by the\nrotation of the vortex pair. As a consequence, a stochastic layer is shown to\nexist also in the vicinity of this cycle, allowing fluid exchange between the\nvortices and the outer flow.

Generally, many algorithms use either the bottom-up or\ntop-down approaches for finding these frequent itemsets. When the length of\nfrequent itemsets to be found is large, the traditional algorithms find all the\nfrequent itemsets from 1-length to n-length, which is a difficult process. This\nproblem can be solved by mining only the Maximal Frequent Itemsets (MFS).\nMaximal Frequent Itemsets are frequent itemsets which have no proper frequent\nsuperset. Thus, the generation of only maximal frequent itemsets reduces the\nnumber of itemsets and also time needed for the generation of all frequent\nitemsets as each maximal itemset of length m implies the presence of 2m-2\nfrequent itemsets. Furthermore, mining only maximal frequent itemset is\nsufficient in many data mining applications like minimal key discovery and\ntheory extraction. In this paper, we suggest a novel method for finding the\nmaximal frequent itemset from huge data sources using the concept of\nsegmentation of data source and prioritization of segments.

An intuitive\nextension of this formalism is communicating ASP, in which multiple ASP\nprograms collaborate to solve the problem at hand. However, the expressiveness\nof communicating ASP has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we present\na systematic study of the additional expressiveness offered by allowing ASP\nprograms to communicate. First, we consider a simple form of communication\nwhere programs are only allowed to ask questions to each other. For the most\npart, we deliberately only consider simple programs, i.e. programs for which\ncomputing the answer sets is in P. We find that the problem of deciding whether\na literal is in some answer set of a communicating ASP program using simple\ncommunication is NP-hard. In other words: we move up a step in the polynomial\nhierarchy due to the ability of these simple ASP programs to communicate and\ncollaborate. Second, we modify the communication mechanism to also allow us to\nfocus on a sequence of communicating programs, where each program in the\nsequence may successively remove some of the remaining models. This mimics a\nnetwork of leaders, where the first leader has the first say and may remove\nmodels that he or she finds unsatisfactory. Using this particular communication\nmechanism allows us to capture the entire polynomial hierarchy. This means, in\nparticular, that communicating ASP could be used to solve problems that are\nabove the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, such as some forms of\nabductive reasoning as well as PSPACE-complete problems such as STRIPS\nplanning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 11:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

We consider\nsynchrotron emission due to cooling of a non-thermal electron distribution in\nan equipartition magnetic field and inverse Compton emission due to the\nscattering off synchrotron photons (SSC) and external soft photons (EC) by the\nsame distribution of electrons. We show that the VHE gamma ray flux cannot be\nexplained by SSC process thereby suggesting the EC mechanism as a plausible\nemission process at this energy. The EC scattering of BLR photons to VHE\nenergies will be in Klein-Nishina regime predicting a steep spectrum which is\ncontrary to the observations. However the infrared photons from the dusty torus\ncan be boosted to VHE energies with the scattering process remaining in the\nThomson regime. Though EC process can successfully explain the observed VHE\nflux, it require a magnetic field much lower than the equipartition value to\nreproduce the observed X-ray flux. Hence we attribute the X-ray emission due to\nSSC process. We derive the physical parameters of 3C 279 considering the above\nmentioned emission processes. In addition we assume the size of emission region\nconstrained by a variability timescale of one day. This model can successfully\nreproduce the broadband spectrum of 3C 279 but predicts substantially large\nflux at MeV-GeV energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 12:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This involves\nconstructing a variational problem that searches over all disturbances of fixed\ninitial amplitude, which respect the boundary conditions, incompressibility and\nthe Navier--Stokes equations, to maximise a chosen functional over an\nasymptotically long time period. The functional must be selected such that it\nidentifies turbulent velocity fields by taking significantly enhanced values\ncompared to those for laminar fields. We illustrate this approach using the\nratio of the final to initial perturbation kinetic energies (energy growth) as\nthe functional and the energy norm to measure amplitudes in the context of pipe\nflow. Our results indicate that the variational problem yields a smooth\nconverged solution providing the amplitude is below the threshold amplitude for\ntransition. This optimal is the nonlinear analogue of the well-studied (linear)\ntransient growth optimal. At and above this threshold, the optimising search\nnaturally seeks out disturbances that trigger turbulence by the end of the\nperiod, and convergence is then practically impossible. The first disturbance\nfound to trigger turbulence as the amplitude is increased identifies the\n`minimal seed' for the given geometry and forcing (Reynolds number). We\nconjecture that it may be possible to select a functional such that the\nconverged optimal below threshold smoothly converges to the minimal seed at\nthreshold. This seems at least approximately true for our choice of energy\ngrowth functional and the pipe flow geometry chosen here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 13:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

The shapes of the pair\ncorrelation distributions are studied in a variety of collision centrality\nclasses between 0 and 50% of the total hadronic cross section for particles in\nthe pseudorapidity interval $|\\eta| < 1.0$. Distributions in relative azimuth\n$\\Delta\\phi \\equiv \\phi^t - \\phi^a$ are analyzed for $|\\Delta\\eta| \\equiv\n|\\eta^t - \\eta^a| > 0.8$, and are referred to as \"long-range correlations\".\nFourier components $V_{n\\Delta} \\equiv \\langle \\cos(n\\Delta\\phi)\\rangle$ are\nextracted from the long-range azimuthal correlation functions. If particle\npairs are correlated to one another through their individual correlation to a\ncommon symmetry plane, then the pair anisotropy $V_{n\\Delta}(p_{T}^t, p_{T}^a)$\nis fully described in terms of single-particle anisotropies $v_n (p_{T})$ as\n$V_{n\\Delta}(p_{T}^t, p_{T}^a) = v_n(p_{T}^t) \\, v_n(p_{T}^a)$. This\nexpectation is tested for $1 \\leq n \\leq 5$ by applying a global fit of all\n$V_{n\\Delta} (p_{T}^t, p_{T}^a)$ to obtain the best values $v_{n}\\{GF\\}\n(p_{T})$. It is found that for $2 \\leq n \\leq 5$, the fit agrees well with data\nup to $p_T^a \\sim 3$-4 GeV/$c$, with a trend of increasing deviation as\n$p_{T}^t$ and $p_{T}^a$ are increased or as collisions become more peripheral.\nThis suggests that no pair correlation harmonic can be described over the full\n$0.25 < p_{T} < 15$ GeV/$c$ range using a single $v_n(p_T)$ curve; such a\ndescription is however approximately possible for $2 \\leq n \\leq 5$ when $p_T^a\n< 4$ GeV/$c$. For the $n=1$ harmonic, however, a single $v_1(p_T$ curve is not\nobtained even within the reduced range $p_T^a < 4$ GeV/$c$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 15:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 09:33:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 09:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}
