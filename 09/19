While\nmany of these studies have concentrated on studying the brain directly, our\nfocus is the structure of the brain itself: at its core an interconnected\nnetwork of nodes (neurons). A better understanding of the structural aspects of\nthe brain should elucidate some of its functional properties. In this paper we\nanalyze the brain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Consisting of only\n302 neurons, it is one of the better-understood neural networks. Using a\nLaplacian matrix of the 279-neuron \"giant component\" of the network, we use an\neigenvalue counting function to look for fractal-like self similarity. This\nmatrix representation is also used to plot (in eigenfunction coordinates) both\n2 and 3 dimensional visualizations of the neural network. Further analysis\nexamines the small-world properties of the system, including average path\nlength and clustering coefficient. We then test for localization of\neigenfunctions, using graph energy and spacial variance. To better understand\nthese results, all of these calculations are also performed on random networks,\nbranching trees, and known fractals, as well as fractals which have been\n\"rewired\" to have small-world properties. This analysis is one of many\nstepping-stones in the research of neural networks. While many of the\nstructures and functions within the brain are known, understanding how the two\ninteract is also important.

Examples and counterexamples of existence of solutions to the\ninfinitesimal conditions are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 08:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-20"}

However, owing to the intrinsic\nfaintness of ICL emission, most searches and detailed studies of ICL have been\nlimited to redshifts z<0.4.We search for ICL in a subsample of ten clusters\ndetected by the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS), at redshifts 0.4<z<0.8,\nthat are also part of our DAFT/FADA Survey. We analyze the ICL by applying the\nOV WAV package, a wavelet-based technique, to deep HST ACS images in the F814W\nfilter and to V-band VLT/FORS2 images of three clusters. Detection levels are\nassessed as a function of the diffuse light source surface brightness using\nsimulations. In the F814W filter images, we detect diffuse light sources in all\nthe clusters, with typical sizes of a few tens of kpc (assuming that they are\nat the cluster redshifts). The ICL detected by stacking the ten F814W images\nshows an 8sigma detection in the source center extending over a ~50x50kpc2\narea, with a total absolute magnitude of -21.6 in the F814W filter, equivalent\nto about two L* galaxies per cluster. We find a weak correlation between the\ntotal F814W absolute magnitude of the ICL and the cluster velocity dispersion\nand mass. There is no apparent correlation between the cluster mass-to-light\nratio (M/L) and the amount of ICL, and no evidence for any preferential\norientation in the ICL source distribution. We find no strong variation in the\namount of ICL between z=0 and z=0.8. In addition, we find wavelet-detected\ncompact objects (WDCOs) in the three clusters for which data in two bands are\navailable; these objects are probably very faint compact galaxies that in some\ncases are members of the respective clusters. We have shown that ICL is\nimportant in clusters at least up to z=0.8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 08:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Initially, each\nlayer has expanded Fermi sphere owing to ridged geometry. When the two layers\nare close enough for tunneling, it becomes energetically advantageous to form\ncorrelated quantum states (CQS), reducing the Fermi sphere volume. Cooper\npairs, comprising inter-tunneling electrons, occupy the CQS. The image force is\nresponsible for the electron-electron attraction. Pair-binding energy and the\ncorresponding effective mass vary in a wide range. At T>0, some heavy pairs do\nnot condense. Such pairs are responsible for pseudogap. Light pairs get Bose\ncondensed and are responsible for superconductivity.

The hypothesis we\nexploit is that large over-abundances of carbon are common among metal-poor\nstars. The selection was made by considering two line indices in the 4300A\nregion, applied directly to the low-resolution prism spectra. This work also\nextends a previously published method by adding bright sources to the sample.\nThe spectra of these stars suffer from saturation effects, compromising the\nindex calculations and leading to an undersampling of the brighter candidates.\nVisual inspection and classification of the spectra from the HES plates yielded\na list of 5,288 new metal-poor candidates, which are presently being used as\ntargets for medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up. Estimates of the stellar\natmospheric parameters, as well as carbon abundances, are now available for 117\nof the first candidates, based on follow-up medium-resolution spectra obtained\nwith the SOAR 4.1m and Gemini 8m telescopes. We demonstrate that our new method\nimproves the metal-poor star fractions found by our pilot study by up to a\nfactor of three in the same magnitude range, as compared with our pilot study\nbased on only one CH G-band index. Our selection scheme obtained roughly a 40%\nsuccess rate for identification of stars with [Fe/H] < -1.0; the primary\ncontaminant is late-type stars with near solar abundances and, often, emission\nline cores that filled in the CaII K line on the prism spectrum. Because the\nselection is based on carbon, we greatly increase the numbers of known CEMP\nstars from the HES with intermediate metallicities -2.0 < [Fe/H] < -1.0, which\nprevious survey efforts undersampled. There are eight newly discovered stars\nwith [Fe/H] < -3.0 in our sample, including two with [Fe/H] < -3.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 10:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We aim at constraining the spatial distribution of density,\ntemperature, velocity field, and chemical abundances in the hot molecular core\nG10.47+0.03. With the Submillimeter Array (SMA), we obtained high spatial and\nspectral resolution of a multitude of molecular lines at different frequencies,\nincluding at 690 GHz. At 345 GHz, our beam size is 0.3\", corresponding to 3000\nAU. We analyze the data using the three-dimensional dust and line radiative\ntransfer code RADMC-3D, and myXCLASS for line identification. We find hundreds\nof molecular lines from complex molecules and high excitations. Even\nvibrationally excited HC15N at 690 GHz is detected. The HCN abundance at high\ntemperatures is very high. Absorption against the dust continuum occurs in\ntwelve transitions, whose shape implies an outflow along the line-of-sight.\nOutside the continuum peak, the line shapes are indicative of infall. Dust\ncontinuum and molecular line emission are resolved at 345 GHz, revealing\ncentral flattening and rapid radial falloff of the density outwards of 10^4 AU,\nbest reproduced by a Plummer radial profile of the density. No fragmentation is\ndetected, but modeling of the line shapes of vibrationally excited HCN suggests\nthe density to be clumpy.

Large gas\nmasses (hundreds of Msun) are heated to high temperatures, aided by diffusion\nof radiation in a high-column-density environment. The increased thermal,\nradiative, turbulent, and wind-driven pressure drives expansion in the central\nregion and is likely responsible for the central flattening of the density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 11:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Traditional clustering algorithms suggest CH election exclusively\nbased on node IDs or location information and involve frequent broadcasting of\ncontrol packets, even when network topology remains unchanged. More recent\nworks take into account additional metrics (such as energy and mobility) and\noptimize initial clustering. However, in many situations (e.g. in relatively\nstatic topologies) re-clustering procedure is hardly ever invoked; hence\ninitially elected CHs soon reach battery exhaustion.

CHs are initially elected based\non the time and cost-efficient lowest-ID method. During clustering maintenance\nphase though, node IDs are re-assigned according to nodes mobility and energy\nstatus, ensuring that nodes with low-mobility and sufficient energy supply are\nassigned low IDs and, hence, are elected as CHs. Our algorithm also reduces\ncontrol traffic volume since broadcast period is adjusted according to nodes\nmobility pattern: we employ infrequent broadcasting for relative static network\ntopologies, and increase broadcast frequency for highly mobile network\nconfigurations.

Studies of red giants showed that this cluster appears\nhomogeneous insofar Fe abundance is concerned, but it shows an extended\nanticorrelation between Na and O abundances. The Na-poor, O-rich population can\nbe identified with the red MS, and the Na-rich, O-poor one with the blue one.\nThis may be understood in terms of different He content, He being correlated\nwith Na. A prediction of this scenario is that He-rich, Na-rich He-core burning\nstars, because they are less massive, will end up on the bluer part of the HB,\nwhile He-poor, Na-poor stars will reside on the red HB. The aim of this paper\nis to verify this prediction. To this purpose, we acquired high-resolution\nspectra of regions including strong O and Na lines in several tens of HB stars\nof NGC2808, sampling both the red and blue parts of the HB. We limited our\nanalysis to those blue HB stars cooler than the gap at 11,500 K, because\ndiffusion and radiative pressure are known to strongly modify the atmospheric\ncomposition of warmer stars. We indeed found a strict correspondence between\nthe colour of the HB stars and their Na and O abundances: all blue HB stars are\nvery O-poor and Na-rich. In addition, we found that while all the red HB stars\nare more O-rich and Na-poor than the blue ones, there is a moderate Na-O\nanticorrelation among them as well. This anticorrelation is in turn related to\nthe colour of the red HB stars. These results reinforce the connection between\nNa and O abundances and the second parameter phenomenon, and show that there\nare more than three stellar populations in NGC 2808 because only a fraction of\nthe red HB stars belong to the primordial population of this cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 12:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In addition, we explain\nhow the algebraic structure used in proofs relates to a ground state\nperturbation series and to quasi-state decompositions, and we show that the\nmonomer-dimer function introduced in an earlier work is an exact, zero energy,\nground state of a suitable finite range Hamiltonian; this is interesting\nbecause of formal analogies with some quantum spin chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 13:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-05"}

A large-scale field reversal may exist in\nthe Milky Way but no such reversals have been observed so far in external\ngalaxies. The effects of star-forming regions of galaxies need to be included\nwhen modelling the evolution of their magnetic fields, which can then be\ncompared to future radio polarization observations. The causes of large-scale\nfield reversals also need clarification. Our model of field evolution in\nisolated disc galaxies includes a standard mean-field dynamo and continuous\ninjection of turbulent fields (the effect of supernova explosions) in discrete\nstar forming regions by implicit small-scale dynamo action. Synthetic maps of\nradio synchrotronemission and Faraday rotation measures are computed. A\nlarge-scale dynamo is essential to obtain regular large-scale spiral magnetic\nfields, observed in many galaxies. These appear, on kpc scales in near energy\nequilibrium with the turbulence, after 1-2 Gyr (redshift 4-3). Turbulent field\ninjection generates small-scale field structures. Depending on model\nparameters, large-scale field reversals may persist over many Gyrs and can\nsurvive until the present epoch. Significant polarized radio synchrotron\nemission from young galaxies is expected at redshifts less than 4. Faraday\nrotation measures (RM) are crucial to detect field reversals. Large-scale\npatterns ofrotation measures can be observed at redshifts less than 3. Our\nmodel can explain the general form of axisymmetric spiral fields with many\nlocal distortions, as observed in nearby galaxies. For a slightly different\nchoice of parameters, large-scale field reversals can persist over the lifetime\nof a galaxy. Comparison of our synthetic maps with future observations of\ndistant galaxies with the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will allow\nrefinement of models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 15:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This leads naturally to Elko symmetry currents. These\nElko symmetry currents can then be coupled with the symmetry currents of the\nElectroweak theory to form interaction Hamiltonian densities, thus providing a\nnatural mechanism for Elko particles to interact directly with Standard Model\nmatter in addition to the Higgs particle. This could have profound implications\nfor the detection of Elko at the LHC. We also show that in a certain sense Elko\nfields are non-local even along the axis of locality. This may make direct\ndetection of Elko difficult. We propose that Elko would therefore still seem\ndark to us, as far as direct detection efforts are concerned. We propose\nhowever, that the allowed gauge interactions between Elko and the electroweak\nsector of the Standard Model may result in the possibility of new experiments\nto be devised to look for Elko indirectly via studying the Standard Model\nparticles that are involved in an Elko interaction.

It is assumed that the cosmological Lambda term, which is\napproximately constant at scales of several Mpc and describes the dark energy,\nis not constant at scales of several tenth of Kpc and describes the \"dark\nmatter effect\".
