Then there exists a finite set Y which is the\nsubset of A that A has and an integer h' = h(A) such that A has Shirshov's\nheight h' over set Y. For Y we may take the set of words of length <d. Such Y\nis called a Shirshov's base of algebra A.\" Shirshov's original proof was purely\ncombinatorical, but did not provide a reasonable upper estimate for the height.\nKolotov obtained an estimate for h(A) < s^(s^m) (m = deg(A), and s is the\nnumber of generators) in 1981. I. Zelmanov asked for an exponential bound in\nthe Dniester Notebook. In 2011 Belov and Kharitonov get the estimate 2^87 m^(12\nlog_3(m)+48) l.

Many popular tensor decomposition approaches---such as the Tucker\ndecomposition and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)---amount to multi-linear\nfactorization. They are insufficient to model (i) complex interactions between\ndata entities, (ii) various data types (e.g. missing data and binary data), and\n(iii) noisy observations and outliers. To address these issues, we propose\ntensor-variate latent nonparametric Bayesian models, coupled with efficient\ninference methods, for multiway data analysis. We name these models InfTucker.\nUsing these InfTucker, we conduct Tucker decomposition in an infinite feature\nspace. Unlike classical tensor decomposition models, our new approaches handle\nboth continuous and binary data in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous\nBayesian models on matrices and tensors, our models are based on latent\nGaussian or $t$ processes with nonlinear covariance functions. To efficiently\nlearn the InfTucker from data, we develop a variational inference technique on\ntensors. Compared with classical implementation, the new technique reduces both\ntime and space complexities by several orders of magnitude. Our experimental\nresults on chemometrics and social network datasets demonstrate that our new\nmodels achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than the most\nstate-of-art tensor decomposition\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 17:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2012 16:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-17"}

This strategy is\nbased on the compute-and-forward framework, which enables relays to decode\ndeterministic functions of the transmitted messages. Alone, compute-and-forward\nis insufficient to approach the capacity as it incurs a penalty for\napproximating the wireless channel with complex-valued coefficients by a\nchannel with integer coefficients.

This is a strictly\nstronger attack than the standard one, and we consider the security of several\nprimitives in this model. We show that a secret-sharing scheme that is secure\nwith threshold $t$ in the standard model is secure against superposition\nattacks if and only if the threshold is lowered to $t/2$.

The result is a practical set equations that is\nvalid for large perturbation amplitudes [q{\\delta}{\\psi}/T = O(1), where\n{\\delta}{\\psi} = {\\delta}{\\phi} - v_par {\\delta}A_par/c], which is\nstraightforward to implement numerically, and which has straightforward\nexpressions for its conservation properties. Here, q is the particle charge,\n{\\delta}{\\phi} and {\\delta}A_par are the perturbed electrostatic and parallel\nmagnetic potentials, v_par is the parallel velocity, c is the speed of light,\nand T is the temperature.

A particularly interesting approach is link traversal based query\nexecution which proposes to integrate the traversal of data links into the\nconstruction of query results. Hence -in contrast to traditional query\nexecution paradigms- this approach does not assume a fixed set of relevant data\nsources beforehand; instead, it discovers data on the fly and, thus, enables\napplications to tap the full potential of the Web.\n  While several authors study possibilities to implement the idea of link\ntraversal based query execution and to optimize query execution in this\ncontext, no work exists that discusses the theoretical foundations of the\napproach in general. Our paper fills this gap.\n  We introduce a well-defined semantics for queries that may be executed using\nthe link traversal based approach. Based on this semantics we formally analyze\nproperties of such queries. In particular, we study the computability of\nqueries as well as the implications of querying a potentially infinite Web of\nLinked Data. Our results show that query computation in general is not\nguaranteed to terminate and that for any given query it is undecidable whether\nthe execution terminates. Furthermore, we define an abstract execution model\nthat captures the integration of link traversal into the query execution\nprocess. Based on this model we prove the soundness and completeness of link\ntraversal based query execution and analyze an existing implementation\napproach..\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 19:22:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 19:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 15:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 12:07:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 18:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-23"}

We derive the total stellar mass fraction f_star as a\nfunction of halo mass M500c from z=0.2 to z=1 using two complementary methods.\nFirst, we derive f_star using a statistical Halo Occupation Distribution model\njointly constrained by data from lensing, clustering, and the stellar mass\nfunction. This method enables us to probe f_star over a much wider halo mass\nrange than with group or cluster catalogs. Second, we derive f_star at group\nscales using a COSMOS X-ray group catalog and we show that the two methods\nagree to within 30%. We quantify the systematic uncertainty on f_star using\nabundance matching methods and we show that the statistical uncertainty on\nf_star (~10%) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellar\nmass measurements (~45% excluding IMF uncertainties). Assuming a Chabrier IMF,\nwe find 0.012<f_star<0.025 at M500c=10^13 Msun and 0.0057<f_star<0.015 at\nM500c=10^14 Msun. These values are significantly lower than previously\npublished estimates. We investigate the cause of this difference and find that\nprevious work has overestimated f_star due to a combination of inaccurate\nstellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies in\ngroups are early type galaxies with a constant mass-to-light ratio. Contrary to\nprevious claims, our results suggest that the mean value of f_star is always\nsignificantly lower than f_gas for halos above 10^13 Msun.

Star formation occurs in very dense, cold,\nself-gravitating clouds. Turbulence, driven by momentum feedback from supernova\nevents, destroys bound clouds and puffs up the disk vertically. Time-dependent\nradiative heating (FUV) offsets gas cooling. We use our simulations to test a\nnew theory for self-regulated star formation. Consistent with this theory, the\ndisks evolve to a state of vertical dynamical equilibrium and thermal\nequilibrium with both warm and cold phases. The range of star formation surface\ndensities and midplane thermal pressures is Sigma_SFR ~ 0.0001 - 0.01\nMsun/kpc^2/yr and P_th/k_B ~ 100 -10000 cm^-3 K. In agreement with\nobservations, turbulent velocity dispersions are ~7 km/s and the ratio of the\ntotal (effective) to thermal pressure is P_tot/P_th~4-5, across this whole\nrange. We show that Sigma_SFR is not well correlated with Sigma alone, but\nrather with Sigma*(rho_sd)^1/2, because the vertical gravity from stars and\ndark matter dominates in outer disks. We also find that Sigma_SFR has a strong,\nnearly linear correlation with P_tot, which itself is within ~13% of the\ndynamical-equilibrium estimate P_tot,DE. The quantitative relationships we find\nbetween Sigma_SFR and the turbulent and thermal pressures show that star\nformation is highly efficient for energy and momentum production, in contrast\nto the low efficiency of mass consumption.

The very basic consequence of such approach is\nthat contrary to the total variation, $TV^c$ is always finite. This is\nappealing to the stochastic analysis where so-far large classes of processes,\nlike semimartingales or diffusions, could not be studied with the total\nvariation. Recently in [6], another characterization of $TV^c$ was found.\nNamely $TV^c$ is the smallest total variation of a function which approximates\n$f$ uniformly with accuracy $c/2$. Due to these properties we envisage that\n$TV^c$ might be a useful concept to the theory of processes.\n  For this reason we determine some properties of $TV^c$ for some well-known\nprocesses. In course of our research we discover intimate connections with\nalready known concepts of the stochastic processes theory.\n  Firstly, for semimartingales we proved that $TV^c$ is of order $c^{-1}$ and\nthe normalized truncated variation converges almost surely to the quadratic\nvariation of the semimartingale as $c\\searrow0$. Secondly, we studied the rate\nof this convergence. As this task was much more demanding we narrowed to the\nclass of diffusions (with some mild additional assumptions). We obtained the\nweak convergence to a so-called Ocone martingale. These results can be viewed\nas some kind of large numbers theorem and the corresponding central limit\ntheorem.\n  All the results above were obtained in a functional setting, viz. we worked\nwith processes describing the growth of the truncated variation in time.\nMoreover, in the same respect we also treated two closely related quantities -\nthe so-called upward truncated variation and downward truncated variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 22:05:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 22:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-29"}

The main goal of this manuscript is to discuss certain statistical\naspects associated with the collapse and its implications in the primordial\nspectrum, particularly those connected with the possible appearance of a novel\ntype of unusual correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 23:33:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 15:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2012 04:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}

This discovery\nwas made just as the initial fast rise was starting, so with fast notification\nand response by observers worldwide, the entire initial rise was covered (the\nfirst for any nova), and with high time resolution in three filters. The speed\nof the rise peaked at 9 mag/day, while the light curve is well fit over only\nthe first two days by a model with a uniformly expanding sphere. We also report\nthe discovery by R. Stubbings of a pre-eruption rise starting 18 days before\nthe eruption, peaking 1.1 mag brighter than its long-time average, and then\nfading back towards quiescence 4 days before the eruption. This unique and\nmysterious behavior is only the fourth known anticipatory rise closely spaced\nbefore a nova eruption. We present 19 timings of photometric minima from 1986\nto February 2011, where the orbital period is fast increasing with\nP/dot{P}=313,000 yrs.

The main attention is focused on the systems where the optimal dynamics\nimplies the stability of a certain equilibrium point in the corresponding phase\nspace. In such systems the fuzzy rationality gives rise to some neighborhood of\nthe equilibrium point, the region of dynamical traps, wherein each point is\nregarded as an equilibrium one by the operators.

This allows us to produce a full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform of\nthe l=2, m=2,-2 modes of the gravitational waveform of an equal-mass\nblack-hole-binary inspiral. These modes match those of numerical-relativity\nsimulations well in phase, though less well in amplitude for the inspiral. As a\nsecond application of this method, we study a merger of black holes with spins\nantialigned in the orbital plane (the \"superkick\" configuration). During the\nringdown of the superkick, the phases of the mass- and current-quadrupole\nradiation become locked together, because they evolve at the same quasinormal\nmode frequencies. We argue that this locking begins during merger, and we show\nthat if the spins of the black holes evolve via geodetic precession in the\nperturbed black-hole spacetime of our model, then the spins precess at the\norbital frequency during merger. In turn, this gives rise to the correct\nbehavior of the radiation, and produces a kick similar to that observed in\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 03:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 00:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-22"}

In\nparticular, we show that, to perform traffic analysis, adversaries do not need\nto directly observe the traffic patterns.

On the other hand, the quantum spin-chain\nmodels can be mapped onto two-dimensional (2D) classical ones. Motivated by the\nscaling and the mapping, we introduce new entanglement entropy for 2D classical\nspin configuration as well as entanglement spectrum, and examine their basic\nproperties in Ising and 3-state Potts models on the square lattice.

We propose a\nmodeling approach to the problem of optimal feeding at zero Reynolds number. We\nconsider a simplified spherical swimmer deforming its shape tangentially in a\nsteady fashion (so-called squirmer). Assuming that the nutrient is a passive\nscalar obeying an advection-diffusion equation, the optimal use of flow fields\nby the swimmer for feeding is determined by maximizing the diffusive flux at\nthe organism surface for a fixed rate of energy dissipation in the fluid. The\nresults are obtained through the use of an adjoint-based numerical optimization\nimplemented by a Legendre polynomial spectral method. We show that, to within a\nnegligible amount, the optimal feeding mechanism consists in putting all the\nenergy expended by surface distortion into swimming - so-called treadmill\nmotion - which is also the solution maximizing the swimming efficiency.\nSurprisingly, although the rate of feeding depends strongly on the value of the\nP\\'eclet number, the optimal feeding stroke is shown to be essentially\nindependent of it, which is confirmed by asymptotic analysis. Within the\ncontext of steady actuation, optimal feeding is therefore found to be\nequivalent to optimal swimming for all P\\'eclet numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 07:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-19"}

Emergence from events has an operational motivation in\nrequiring that every physical quantity---including space-time---be defined\nthrough precise measurement procedures. Topological homogeneity is a\nrequirement for having space-time metric emergent from the pure topology of\ncausal connections, whereas physically homogeneity corresponds to the\nuniversality of the physical law. We analyze in detail the case of 1+1\ndimensions. If we consider the causal connections as an exchange of classical\ninformation, we can establish coordinate systems via an Einsteinian protocol,\nand this leads to a digital version of the Lorentz transformations. In a\ncomputational analogy, the foliation construction can be regarded as the\nsynchronization with a global clock of the calls to independent subroutines\n(corresponding to the causally independent events) in a parallel distributed\ncomputation. Thus the Lorentz time-dilation emerges as an increased density of\nleaves within a single tic-tac of a clock, whereas space-contraction results\nfrom the corresponding decrease of density of events per leaf. The operational\nprocedure of building up the coordinate system introduces an in-principle\nindistinguishability between neighboring events, resulting in a network that is\ncoarse-grained, the thickness of the event being a function of the observer's\nclock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 08:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 14:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

The\nchaotic Hamiltonian H\\'{e}non-Heiles system for motion of stars orbiting in a\nplane about the galactic center is used as an example to show its basic ideas\nand validity. Based on Taylor expansion at rather high-order and MP (multiple\nprecision) data in very high accuracy, the CNS approach can provide reliable\ntrajectories of the chaotic system in a finite interval $t\\in[0,T_c]$, together\nwith an explicit estimation of the critical time $T_c$. Besides, the residual\nand round-off errors are verified and estimated carefully by means of different\ntime-step $\\Delta t$, different precision of data, and different order $M$ of\nTaylor expansion. In this way, the numerical noises of the CNS can be reduced\nto a required level, i.e. the CNS is a rigorous algorithm. It is illustrated\nthat, for the considered problem, the truncation and round-off errors of the\nCNS can be reduced even to the level of $10^{-1244}$ and $10^{-1000}$,\nrespectively, so that the micro-level inherent physical uncertainty of the\ninitial condition (in the level of $10^{-60}$) of the H\\'{e}non-Heiles system\ncan be investigated accurately. It is found that, due to the sensitive\ndependence on initial condition (SDIC) of chaos, the micro-level inherent\nphysical uncertainty of the position and velocity of a star transfers into the\nmacroscopic randomness of motion. Thus, chaos might be a bridge from the\nmicro-level inherent physical uncertainty to the macroscopic randomness in\nnature. This might provide us a new explanation to the SDIC of chaos from the\nphysical viewpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 09:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 01:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 05:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2012 06:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

Owing to its lower background level, Suzaku has\nbetter sensitivity to Fe K-alpha lines than other satellites. Using precise Fe\nline measurements, we studied the temperature structure, possible bulk motions,\nand iron abundance distributions in the intracluster medium (ICM). The observed\nspectra were well-represented by a single-temperature model, and two- or three-\ntemperature model did not improve chi-square substantially. The temperature,\nderived from K-alpha line ratios of H-like and He-like Fe, agree with those\nderived from the single-temperature model. Because the line ratio is a steep\nfunction of temperature, the consistency supports the accuracy of temperature\nmeasurements conducted with Suzaku. Within the 34'region, the redshift derived\nfrom the central energy of the He-like Fe line is consistent with that from\noptical observations, within a calibration error of 18 eV or 818 km/s in the\nline of sight. This value is smaller than the sound velocity of ICM, which is\n1500 km/s. The central energy of Fe lines at the 44'offset region around the\nNGC 4839 subcluster is also consistent with those within the 34'region. These\nresults on the temperature and velocity structure suggest that the core of the\ncluster is in a relaxed state, and non-thermal electrons relevant to the radio\nhalo are accelerated by intracluster turbulence rather than large-scale shocks.\nFe abundance is almost constant at 0.4 solar within the 34'region, and\ndecreases with radius.

Because of the\nrapid growth of the Hilbert space, the size of the finite bath used to\nrepresent the infinite lattice is severely limited. In view of the increasing\ninterest in the effect of multi-orbital and multi-site Coulomb correlations in\ntransition metal oxides, high-Tc cuprates, iron-based pnictides, organic\ncrystals, etc., it is appropriate to explore the range of temperatures and bath\nsizes in which ED provides accurate results for various system properties. The\nbath must be large enough to achieve a sufficiently dense level spacing, so\nthat useful spectral information can be derived, especially close to the\nFermi-level. For an adequate projection of the lattice Green's function onto a\nfinite bath, the choice of the temperature is crucial. The role of these two\nkey ingredients in ED DMFT is discussed for a wide variety of systems in order\nto establish the domain of applicability of this approach. Three criteria are\nused to illustrate the accuracy of the results: (i) the convergence of the\nself-energy with bath size, (ii) quality of the discretization of the bath\nGreen's function, and (iii) comparisons with complementary results obtained via\nCTQMC DMFT. The materials comprise a variety of three- and five-orbital\nsystems, as well as single-band Hubbard models for two-dimensional triangular,\nsquare and honeycomb lattices, where non-local Coulomb correlations are\nimportant. The main conclusion from these examples is that a larger number of\ncorrelated orbitals or sites requires a smaller number of bath levels.
