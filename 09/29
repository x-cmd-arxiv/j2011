A focused sequent calculus is\ndefined relative to some non-focused sequent calculus; focalization is the\nproperty that every non-focused derivation can be transformed into a focused\nderivation.\n  In this paper, we present a focused sequent calculus for propositional\nintuitionistic logic and prove the focalization property relative to a standard\npresentation of propositional intuitionistic logic. Compared to existing\napproaches, the proof is quite concise, depending only on the internal\nsoundness and completeness of the focused logic. In turn, both of these\nproperties can be established (and mechanically verified) by structural\ninduction in the style of Pfenning's structural cut elimination without the\nneed for any tedious and repetitious invertibility lemmas. The proof of cut\nadmissibility for the focused system, which establishes internal soundness, is\nnot particularly novel. The proof of identity expansion, which establishes\ninternal completeness, is a major contribution of this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 17:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2012 23:52:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2012 00:57:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 21:02:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 17:19:51 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 01:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 01:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-18"}

The early-type galaxies (ETGs) that are detected contain as much\ndust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindly\nselected at submillimetre wavelengths.\n  Comparing H-ATLAS galaxies to a control sample of optically selected\ngalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous ETGs are detected in H-ATLAS. The H-ATLAS\nETGs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7\nMsun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 Msun. This is\ncomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude more\ndust than that found for the control ETGs, which have a median dust mass\ninferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 Msun. The ETGs detected in H-ATLAS\nhave bluer NUV-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and younger\nstellar populations than ETGs which are optically selected, and may be\ntransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. We also find that\nH-ATLAS and control ETGs inhabit similar low-density environments. We conclude\nthat the dust in H-ATLAS and control ETGs cannot be solely from stellar\nsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ISM or external\nsources is required. Alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient as\npredicted.\n  We also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in our\nsample with SSFR<10^-11/yr. We find these passive spirals have lower\ndust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar population\nages than normal spirals. The passive spirals inhabit low density environments\nsimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. This shows that\nthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in the\nintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

Any graph $G$ has an associated\nreciprocal polynomial $R_G$, and with two particular classes of reciprocal\npolynomials in mind one can ask the questions: (a) when is $R_G$ a product of\ncyclotomic polynomials (giving the cyclotomic graphs)? (b) when does $R_G$ have\nthe minimal polynomial of a Salem number as its only non-cyclotomic factor (the\nnon-trival Salem graphs)? Cyclotomic graphs were classified by Smith in 1970.\nSalem graphs are `spectrally close' to being cyclotomic, in that nearly all\ntheir eigenvalues are in the critical interval [-2,2]. On the other hand Salem\ngraphs do not need to be `combinatorially close' to being cyclotomic: the\nlargest cyclotomic induced subgraph might be comparatively tiny.\n  We define an $m$-Salem graph to be a connected Salem graph $G$ for which $m$\nis minimal such that there exists an induced cyclotomic subgraph of $G$ that\nhas $m$ fewer vertices than $G$. The 1-Salem subgraphs are both spectrally\nclose and combinatorially close to being cyclotomic.

The algorithm\niteratively subdivides an initial interval which is known to contain all real\nroots of f. The main novelty of our approach is that we combine Descartes' Rule\nof Signs and Newton iteration. More precisely, instead of using a fixed\nsubdivision strategy such as bisection in each iteration, a Newton step based\non the number of sign variations for an actual interval is considered, and,\nonly if the Newton step fails, we fall back to bisection. Following this\napproach, our analysis shows that, for most iterations, we can achieve\nquadratic convergence towards the real roots. In terms of complexity, our\nmethod induces a recursion tree of almost optimal size O(nlog(n tau)), where n\ndenotes the degree of the polynomial and tau the bitsize of its coefficients.\nThe latter bound constitutes an improvement by a factor of tau upon all\nexisting subdivision methods for the task of isolating the real roots. In\naddition, we provide a bit complexity analysis showing that DSC2 needs only\n\\tilde{O}(n^3tau) bit operations to isolate all real roots of f. This matches\nthe best bound known for this fundamental problem. However, in comparison to\nthe much more involved algorithms by Pan and Sch\\\"onhage (for the task of\nisolating all complex roots) which achieve the same bit complexity, DSC2\nfocuses on real root isolation, is very easy to access and easy to implement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 17:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-29"}

One or\nmore robust or tentative counterpart candidate is found for 27 and 14 AzTEC\nsources, respectively, by employing deep radio continuum, Spitzer MIPS & IRAC,\nand LABOCA 870 micron data. Five of the sources (10%) have two robust\ncounterparts each, supporting the idea that these galaxies are strongly\nclustered and/or heavily confused. Photometric redshifts and star formation\nrates (SFRs) are derived by analyzing UV-to-optical and IR-to-radio SEDs. The\nmedian redshift of z~2.6 is similar to other earlier estimates, but we show\nthat 80% of the AzTEC-GOODS sources are at z>2, with a significant high\nredshift tail (20% at z>3.3).

Here, the 7-year WMAP data are used\nto trace the disk and the halo of the nearby giant spiral galaxy M31. We\nanalyzed the temperature excess in three WMAP bands (W, V, and Q) by dividing\nthe region of the sky around M31 into several concentric circular areas. We\nstudied the robustness of the detected temperature excess by considering 500\nrandom control fields in the real WMAP maps and simulating 500 sky maps from\nthe best-fitted cosmological parameters. By comparing the obtained temperature\ncontrast profiles with the real ones towards the M31 galaxy, we find that the\ntemperature asymmetry in the M31 disk is fairly robust, while the effect in the\nhalo is weaker. An asymmetry in the mean microwave temperature in the M31 disk\nalong the direction of the M31 rotation is observed with a temperature contrast\nup to about 130 microK/pixel. We also find a temperature asymmetry in the M31\nhalo, which is much weaker than for the disk, up to a galactocentric distance\nof about 10 degrees (120 kpc) with a peak temperature contrast of about 40\nmicroK/pixel. Although the confidence level of the signal is not high, if\nestimated purely statistically, which could be expected due to the weakness of\nthe effect, the geometrical structure of the temperature asymmetry points\ntowards a definite effect modulated by the rotation of the M31 halo. This\nresult might open a new way to probe these relatively less studied galactic\nobjects using high-accuracy CMB measurements, such as those with the Planck\nsatellite or planned balloon-based experiments, which could prove or disprove\nour conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 18:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-17"}

To probe the formation history of these stellar\npopulations, a detailed analysis of a sample of very metal-rich stars is\ncarried out.

But, as already stressed in our previous papers since 1995, a weak\nmixing of standard particles with superbradyons (particles with positive mass\nand energy, and a critical speed in vacuum much larger than the speed of light)\ncan explain such an effect. Superbradyons can be the ultimate constituents of\nmatter (superluminal preons), but they may simultaneously exist in our Universe\nas free particles just as light can cross a transparent material medium. In\nthis case, a direct mixing between superbradyons and the particles of the\nstandard model would be unavoidable. After briefly examining the experimental\nsituation and the problems it may raise, we comment on the possibility of a\nsuperbradyonic mixing, as well as on the implications of a spinorial\ndescription of space-time where space translations would form a SU(2) compact\ngroup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 19:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-29"}

In particular, we develop a nonperturbative\ntheory of weak PPS measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter,\nfor arbitrary initial states. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained\nfor the average and the distribution of the meter pointer variable, which hold\nto all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in\naddition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to\ndescribe weak PPS measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the\ngeneralized Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new\nregimes of weak PPS measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the\ninverted region, where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer\ndeflection decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal\nconditions for weak PPS measurements are achieved in the strongly-nonlinear\nregime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is equal or close\nto the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being\ntypically of the order of the pointer uncertainty. We show that the\namplification in the weak PPS measurements is a product of two qualitatively\ndifferent quantities: proper amplification and enhancement. The effects of the\nfree system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed. We also identify optimal\nmeters for weak measurements. Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class\nof the measured observables. These solutions are used for numerical\ncalculations, the results of which agree with the theory.

Most methods fall into two broad groups: those that\nuse nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that use\nfixed apertures. The differences between the two inhibit a clean comparison\nbetween analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data,\ndifferent properties are actually being measured. In this work we apply twenty\npublished environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrained\nto look like the local Universe. We find that nearest neighbour-based measures\nbest probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses the\ninter-halo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local density\nvariations. The resulting correlation also shows that nearest neighbour galaxy\nenvironment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. Conversely,\naperture-based methods that probe super-halo scales accurately identify\nhigh-density regions corresponding to high mass haloes. Both methods show how\ngalaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of the\nlargest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the background\ndark matter environment.

The fraction of stars that are\ndirectly captured is also no longer negligible. We calculate generically\noriented stellar orbits in the Kerr metric, and evaluate the relativistic tidal\ntensor at pericenter for those stars not directly captured by the black hole.\nWe combine this relativistic analysis with previous calculations of how these\norbits are populated to determine tidal-disruption rates for spinning black\nholes.

In the case of dynamic systems that allow\nfor nondeterministic evolutions, one has to specify, along with an LTL formula\nf, which are the paths that are required to satisfy the formula. Two extreme\ncases are the universal interpretation A.f, which requires that the formula be\nsatisfied for all execution paths, and the existential interpretation E.f,\nwhich requires that the formula be satisfied for some execution path.\n  When LTL is applied to the definition of goals in planning problems on\nnondeterministic domains, these two extreme cases are too restrictive. It is\noften impossible to develop plans that achieve the goal in all the\nnondeterministic evolutions of a system, and it is too weak to require that the\ngoal is satisfied by some execution.\n  In this paper we explore alternative interpretations of an LTL formula that\nare between these extreme cases. We define a new language that permits an\narbitrary combination of the A and E quantifiers, thus allowing, for instance,\nto require that each finite execution can be extended to an execution\nsatisfying an LTL formula (AE.f), or that there is some finite execution whose\nextensions all satisfy an LTL formula (EA.f). We show that only eight of these\ncombinations of path quantifiers are relevant, corresponding to an alternation\nof the quantifiers of length one (A and E), two (AE and EA), three (AEA and\nEAE), and infinity ((AE)* and (EA)*). We also present a planning algorithm for\nthe new language that is based on an automata-theoretic approach, and study its\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 20:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

This evolutionary process is\ndriven by changes in the underlying parameters and constraints (the\n\"environment\") and it aims to minimize the modification cost after each change\nin the environment. In this paper, we first formulate the incremental design\napproach (in three variations), and compare that with the more traditional\noptimized design approach in which the objective is to minimize the total\nnetwork cost. We evaluate the cost overhead and evolvability of incremental\ndesign under two network expansion models (random and gradual), comparing\nincremental and optimized networks in terms of cost, topological similarity,\ndelay and robustness. We find that even though incremental design has some cost\noverhead, that overhead does not increase as the network grows. Also, it is\nless costly to evolve an existing network than to design it \"from scratch\" as\nlong as the network expansion factor is less than a critical value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 20:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

An antisolar dust tail is observed from August 2010\nthrough February 2011, while a dust trail aligned with the object's orbit plane\nis also observed from December 2010 through August 2011. Assuming typical phase\ndarkening behavior, P/La Sagra is seen to increase in brightness by >1 mag\nbetween August 2010 and December 2010, suggesting that dust production is\nongoing over this period.

We assess\nthe possibility to use lensed SNe to put constraints on the mass models of\ngalaxy clusters and the Hubble parameter at high redshift. Due to the standard\ncandle nature of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observational information on the\nlensing magnification from an intervening galaxy cluster can be used to\nconstrain the model for the cluster mass distribution. A statistical analysis\nusing parametric cluster models was performed to investigate the possible\nimprovements from lensed SNe Ia for the accurately modeled galaxy cluster A1689\nand the less well constrained cluster A2204. Time delay measurements obtained\nfrom SNe lensed by accurately modeled galaxy clusters can be used to measure\nthe Hubble parameter. For a survey of A1689 we estimate the expected rate of\ndetectable SNe Ia and of multiply imaged SNe. The velocity dispersion and core\nradius of the main cluster potential show strong correlations with the\npredicted magnifications and can therefore be constrained by observations of\nSNe Ia in background galaxies. This technique proves especially powerful for\ngalaxy clusters with only few known multiple image systems. The main\nuncertainty for measurements of the Hubble parameter from the time delay of\nstrongly lensed SNe is due to cluster model uncertainties. For the extremely\nwell modeled cluster A1689, a single time delay measurement could be used to\ndetermine the Hubble parameter with a precision of ~ 10%. We conclude that\nobservations of SNe Ia behind galaxy clusters can be used to improve the mass\nmodeling of the large scale component of galaxy clusters and thus the\ndistribution of dark matter. Time delays from SNe strongly lensed by accurately\nmodeled galaxy clusters can be used to measure the Hubble constant at high\nredshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 20:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We show that most climate simulations of 20th and\n21st century A2 scenario performed with IPCC-AR4 models have deficiencies in\nsimulating the global atmospheric moisture balance. Large biases of only a few\nmodels affect the multi-model mean global moisture budget and an imbalanced\nflux of -0.14 Sv exists whereas the multi-model median imbalance is only -0.02\nSv.

DOAS spectra consist of a linear combination of complex\nmulti-peak multi-scale structures. Most DOAS analysis routines in use today are\nbased on least squares techniques, for example, the approach developed in the\n1970s uses polynomial fits to remove a slowly varying background, and known\nreference spectra to retrieve the identity and concentrations of reference\ngases. An open problem is to identify unknown gases in the fitting residuals\nfor complex atmospheric mixtures.\n  In this work, we develop a novel three step semi-blind source separation\nmethod. The first step uses a multi-resolution analysis to remove the\nslow-varying and fast-varying components in the DOAS spectral data matrix $X$.\nThe second step decomposes the preprocessed data $\\hat{X}$ in the first step\ninto a linear combination of the reference spectra plus a remainder, or\n$\\hat{X} = A\\,S + R$, where columns of matrix $A$ are known reference spectra,\nand the matrix $S$ contains the unknown non-negative coefficients that are\nproportional to concentration. The second step is realized by a convex\nminimization problem $S = \\mathrm{arg} \\min \\mathrm{norm}\\,(\\hat{X} - A\\,S)$,\nwhere the norm is a hybrid $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$ norm (Huber estimator) that helps to\nmaintain the non-negativity of $S$. The third step performs a blind independent\ncomponent analysis of the remainder matrix $R$ to extract remnant gas\ncomponents. We first illustrate the proposed method in processing a set of DOAS\nexperimental data by a satisfactory blind extraction of an a-priori unknown\ntrace gas (ozone) from the remainder matrix. Numerical results also show that\nthe method can identify multiple trace gases from the residuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 23:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

The method\nis able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and\npositive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism\nand divergence. Information about divergence is obtained from multiple outgroup\ngenomes using a full phylogenetic model. The model is efficiently fitted to\ngenome-wide data by decomposing the maximum likelihood estimation procedure\ninto three straightforward stages. The key selection-related parameters are\nestimated by expectation maximization. Using simulations, we show that INSIGHT\ncan accurately estimate several parameters of interest even in complex\ndemographic scenarios.

We consider a setup where communication links between components can\nbe asymmetric (i.e., component j might be able to send information to component\ni, but not necessarily vice-versa), so that the information exchange between\ncomponents in the system is in general described by a directed graph that is\nassumed to be strongly connected. In the absence of communication link\nfailures, each component i maintains two auxiliary variables and updates each\nof their values to be a linear combination of their corresponding previous\nvalues and the corresponding previous values of neighboring components (i.e.,\ncomponents that send information to node i). By appropriately initializing\nthese two (decoupled) iterations, the system components can asymptotically\ncalculate variables of interest in a distributed fashion; in particular, the\naverage of the initial conditions can be calculated as a function that involves\nthe ratio of these two auxiliary variables. The focus of this paper to\nrobustify this double-iteration algorithm against communication link failures.\nWe achieve this by modifying the double-iteration algorithm (by introducing\nsome additional auxiliary variables) and prove that the modified\ndouble-iteration converges almost surely to average consensus.

We have determined the\nalbedos for nearly 1900 asteroids classified by the Tholen, Bus and Bus-DeMeo\ntaxonomic classification schemes. We find that the S-complex spans a broad\nrange of bright albedos, partially overlapping the low albedo C-complex at\nsmall sizes. As expected, the X-complex covers a wide range of albedos. The\nmulti-wavelength infrared coverage provided by NEOWISE allows determination of\nthe reflectivity at 3.4 and 4.6 $\\mu$m relative to the visible albedo. The\ndirect computation of the reflectivity at 3.4 and 4.6 $\\mu$m enables a new\nmeans of comparing the various taxonomic classes. Although C, B, D and T\nasteroids all have similarly low visible albedos, the D and T types can be\ndistinguished from the C and B types by examining their relative reflectance at\n3.4 and 4.6 $\\mu$m. All of the albedo distributions are strongly affected by\nselection biases against small, low albedo objects, as all objects selected for\ntaxonomic classification were chosen according to their visible light\nbrightness. Due to these strong selection biases, we are unable to determine\nwhether or not there are correlations between size, albedo and space\nweathering. We argue that the current set of classified asteroids makes any\nsuch correlations difficult to verify. A sample of taxonomically classified\nasteroids drawn without significant albedo bias is needed in order to perform\nsuch an analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 05:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Herein, we report a novel orientation sensor at nanoscale\nby defocused imaging of single Au nanorods (AuNRs) through an ordinary\nwide-field optical microscope. By simultaneously recording defocused images and\ntwo-photon luminescence intensities for a large number of single AuNRs, we\ncorrelate their defocused images with their three-dimensional spatial\norientations. As many AuNRs can be monitored in parallel, defocused imaging of\nsingle AuNRs is a high throughput sensing technique that allows us to obtain\ntheir spatial orientations within one frame in situ and real-time. The probe\nsize can be down to several nanometers, which is highly desirable in order to\nminimize any potential interference from the probe itself. Furthermore, the\nsensing property is insensitive to the excitation polarization and the\ndistribution of the probe aspect ratio, which allows AuNRs of any length in a\nproper regime to be used as orientation sensors without changing the laser\nfrequency and polarization.

However, the measure bifurcates\ninto a pair of distinct measures for any quantity that is not merely an event\nindicator. As with entropy, the maximum extropy distribution is also the\nuniform distribution, and both measures are invariant with respect to\npermutations of their mass functions. However, they behave quite differently in\ntheir assessments of the refinement of a distribution, the axiom which\nconcerned Shannon and Jaynes. Their duality is specified via the relationship\namong the entropies and extropies of course and fine partitions. We also\nanalyze the extropy function for densities, showing that relative extropy\nconstitutes a dual to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, widely recognized as the\ncontinuous entropy measure. These results are unified within the general\nstructure of Bregman divergences. In this context they identify half the $L_2$\nmetric as the extropic dual to the entropic directed distance.

The photometric redshift technique is applied to the galaxy\nsample for further membership determination. After the color-magnitude relation\nis taken into account, 97 galaxies brighter than h_batc=19.5 mag are selected\nas new member galaxies. Based on the enlarged sample of cluster galaxies,\nspatial distribution, dynamics of A671 are investigated. The substructures of\nA671 are well shown by the sample of bright members, but it appears less\nsignificant based on the enlarged sample, which is mainly due to larger\nuncertainties in the light-of-sight velocities of the newly-selected faint\nmembers. The SDSS r-band luminosity function of A671 is flat at faint\nmagnitudes, with the faint end slope parameter alpha=-1.12.

Polarized DIS, i.e. the collision of a longitudinally polarized lepton\nbeam on a polarized target (either longitudinally or transversely polarized),\nprovides a complementary information regarding the structure of the nucleon.\nWhereas ordinary DIS probes simply the number density of partons with a\nfraction x of the momentum of the parent hadron, polarized DIS can partly\nanswer the question as to the number density of partons with given x and given\nspin polarization in a hadron of definite polarization, either parallel or\ntransverse with respect to the motion of the hadron.

Semi-analytic models\ngenerally predict a fast lateral expansion, where the jet opening angle\nasymptotically grows exponentially with its radius. Numerical simulations,\nhowever, show a much more modest lateral expansion, where the jet retains\nmemory of its initial opening angle for a very long time, and the flow remains\nnon-spherical until it becomes sub-relativistic, and only then gradually\napproaches spherical symmetry. Here we suggest a new analytic model based on a\nnew physically derived recipe for the lateral expansion. We also generalize the\nmodel by relaxing the common approximations of ultra-relativistic motion and a\nnarrow jet opening angle. We find that the new analytic model fits much better\nthe results of numerical simulations, mainly because it remains valid also in\nthe mildly relativistic, quasi spherical regime. This model shows that for\nmodest initial jet half-opening angles, \\theta_0, the outflow is not\nsufficiently ultra-relativistic when its Lorentz factor reaches \\Gamma =\n1/\\theta_0 and therefore the sideways expansion is rather slow, showing no\nrapid, exponential phase. On the other hand, we find that jets with an\nextremely narrow initial half-opening angle, of about \\theta_0 << 10^{-1.5} or\nso, which are still sufficiently ultra-relativistic at \\Gamma = 1/\\theta_0, do\nshow a phase of rapid, exponential lateral expansion. However, even such jets\nthat expand sideways exponentially are still not spherical when they become\nsub-relativistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 10:42:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 18:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-11"}

In comparison with\nthe corresponding rules of classical statistical mechanics, the rules for\ncomputing the probabilities and time-dependent averages of observables are\nmodified. The evolution equations represent a finite system of first-order\nordinary differential equations for quantum trajectories in the phase space and\nthe associated Jacobi fields.

For a bundle consisting of two filaments, upon\nincreasing the bending amplitude, a first-order transition is observed.

The\nresult has been new insights into the flaring process, as well as more\nquantitative models for both electron acceleration and propagation, and for the\nflare environment with which the electrons interact. In this article we review\nour current understanding of electron acceleration, energy loss, and\npropagation in flares.

Cluster relations\nsuch as the Lx-T, M-T, Lx-M relations, have been investigated extensively,\nhowever the question remains whether these relations hold true also for groups.\nSome evidence supports a break at low masses, possibly caused by the influence\nof non-gravitational physics on low-mass systems. The main goal of this work is\nto test scaling relations for the low-mass range to check whether there is a\nsystematic difference between clusters and groups, and to extend this method of\nreliable cluster mass determination for future samples down to the group\nregime. We compiled a statistically complete sample of 112 X-ray galaxy groups,\n26 with Chandra data. Temperature, metallicity, and surface brightness profiles\nwere created, and used to determine the main physical quantities and scaling\nrelations. We then compared the group properties to the HIFLUGCS clusters and\nother samples. We present profiles and scaling relations of the whole sample. T\nand Z profiles behave universally, except for the cores. The Lx-T, M-T, Lx-M,\nMg-M, M-Yx, and Lx-Yx relations are in good agreement with clusters. The Lx-T\nrelation steepens for T<3keV, which could point to a larger impact of heating\nmechanisms on cooler systems. We found a strong drop in the gas mass fraction\nbelow 1keV, which indicates the ICM is less dominant in groups and the galaxies\nhave a stronger influence on the system. In all relations the intrinsic scatter\nfor groups is larger, which appears not correlated with merger activity but\ncould be due to scatter caused by baryonic physics in the group cores. We also\ndemonstrate the importance of selection effects. We have found evidence for a\nsimilarity break between groups and clusters. However this does not have a\nstrong effect on scaling relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 12:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 12:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Previous observation of the\nMira star omicron Ceti around a bright maximum of light led to the detection of\na strong linear polarization associated to Balmer emissions, although the\norigin of this phenomenon is not fully explained yet. With the help of\nspectropolarimetry, we propose to investigate the nature of shock waves\npropagating throughout the stellar atmosphere and present, for omicron Ceti\n(the prototype of Mira stars), a full observational study of hydrogen emission\nlines formed in the radiative region of such a shock. Using the instrument\nNARVAL, we performed a spectropolarimetric monitoring of omicron Ceti during\nthree consecutive pulsation cycles. All Stokes parameters were systematically\ncollected, with a particular emphasis on the maxima of luminosity, i.e. when a\nradiative shock wave is supposed to emerge from the photosphere and propagate\noutward. On Balmer lines, over a large part of the luminosity cycle, we report\ndetections in Stokes spectra which are evolving with time. These signatures\nappear to be strongly correlated to the presence of an intense shock wave\nresponsible for the hydrogen emission lines. We establish that those lines are\npolarized by a process inherent to the mechanism responsible for the emission\nline formation: the shock wave itself. Two mechanisms are considered: a global\none that implies a polarization induced by convective cells located around the\nphotosphere and a local one that implies a charge separation due to the passage\nof the shock wave, inducing an electrical current. Combined with the existing\nturbulence, this may generate a magnetic field, hence polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 12:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

The storage is\nfrictionless as a supply source, but once used, it cannot be filled up\ninstantaneously. The focus application is a power supply network in which the\nbase supply and demand are assumed to match perfectly, while deviations from\nthe base are modeled as random shocks with stochastic arrivals. Due to\nfriction, the random surge shocks cannot be tracked by the main supply sources.\nStorage, when available, can be used to compensate, fully or partially, for the\nsurge in demand or loss of supply. The problem of optimal utilization of\nstorage with the objective of maximizing system reliability is formulated as\nminimization of the expected discounted cost of blackouts over an infinite\nhorizon. It is shown that when the stage cost is linear in the size of the\nblackout, the optimal policy is myopic in the sense that all shocks are\ncompensated by storage up to the available level of storage. However, when the\nstage cost is strictly convex, it may be optimal to curtail some of the demand\nand allow a small current blackout in the interest of maintaining a higher\nlevel of reserve to avoid a large blackout in the future. The value of storage\ncapacity in improving system's reliability, as well as the effects of the\nassociated optimal policies under different stage costs on the probability\ndistribution of blackouts are examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 12:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

These RSPs are typically using the channel\nside information (CSI). Specifically, the relay terminal (RT) is chosen among\nall available RTs by a central entity (CE) which receives all RTs' CSI via\nfeedback channels. However, in the millimeter wave radio frequencies, the rate\nof the CSI variation is much higher than that of the CSI variation in 6 GHz\nfrequencies under the same mobility conditions, which evidently results in a\nserious problem causing that the CSI at the CE is inaccurate for the RSP since\nthe feedback channels have a backhaul / transmission delay.

Power broadening is investigated using a time-convolutionless\nmaster equation in the polaron frame which allows for a nonperturbative\ntreatment of the interaction of the quantum dot with the phonon reservoir. We\ncalculate the full non-Lorentzian photoluminescence (PL) lineshapes and\nnumerically extract the intensity linewidths of the quantum dot exciton and the\ncavity mode as a function of pump rate and temperature. For increasing field\nstrengths, multiphonon and multiphoton effects are found to be important, even\nfor phonon bath temperatures as low as 4 K. We show that the interaction of the\nquantum dot with the phonon reservoir introduces pronounced features in the\npower broadened PL lineshape, enabling one to observe clear signatures of\nelectron-phonon scattering. The PL lineshapes from cavity pumping and exciton\npumping are found to be distinctly different, primarily since the latter is\nexcited through the exciton-phonon reservoir. To help explain the underlying\nphysics of phonon scattering on the power broadened lineshape, an effective\nphonon Lindblad master equation derived from the full time-convolutionless\nmaster equation is introduced; we identify and calculate distinct Lindblad\nscattering contributions from electron-phonon interactions, including effects\nsuch as excitation-induced dephasing, incoherent exciton excitation and\nexciton-cavity feeding.

Based on buoy data for the Indian Ocean, the\nfitting of the modified model WAM was done, which provides the win in accuracy\nof calculations on 35%, in comparison with the original model. All the further\ncalculations of the wave fields in IO were made for these model settings. At\nthe first stage, the analysis of the simulation results involves a) mapping the\nfields of the significant wave height <Hs(x,y,T,R)> and the wave energy\n<Ea(x,y,T,R>, calculated with different scales of averaging in time T and space\nR; b) estimating the fields of seasonal, annual and long-term variability; and\nc) determining the 12-year trend of the annually averaged fields. The analysis\nwas carried out taking into account the previously introduced zoning the ocean\narea, provided by the spatial inhomogeneity of the wind field [3]. Further\nanalysis includes a) creation of time series for the averaged (over zones and\nacross the ocean) wave height, <Hs(x,y,T,R)>, and wave energy, <Ea(x,y,T,R>; b)\nconstruction of the frequency spectra of these series; c) finding the extrema\nof wave field; d) making histograms of wave heights (in the zones and the whole\nocean); and e) calculating the first four statistical moments for the\nwaveheight field (in the zones and whole IO).

In this paper we\nrevisit and refine the computations of the cosmological thermalization problem.\nFor this purpose a new code, called CosmoTherm, was developed that allows\nsolving the coupled photon-electron Boltzmann equation in the expanding,\nisotropic Universe for small spectral distortion in the CMB. We explicitly\ncompute the shape of the spectral distortions caused by energy release due to\n(i) annihilating dark matter; (ii) decaying relict particles; (iii) dissipation\nof acoustic waves; and (iv) quasi-instantaneous heating. We also demonstrate\nthat (v) the continuous interaction of CMB photons with adiabatically cooling\nnon-relativistic electrons and baryons causes a negative mu-type CMB spectral\ndistortion of DI_nu/I_nu ~ 10^{-8} in the GHz spectral band. We solve the\nthermalization problem including improved approximations for the double Compton\nand Bremsstrahlung emissivities, as well as the latest treatment of the\ncosmological recombination process. At redshifts z <~ 10^3 the matter starts to\ncool significantly below the temperature of the CMB so that at very low\nfrequencies free-free absorption alters the shape of primordial distortions\nsignificantly. In addition, the cooling electrons down-scatter CMB photons\nintroducing a small late negative y-type distortion at high frequencies. We\nalso discuss our results in the light of the recently proposed CMB experiment\nPixie, for which CosmoTherm should allow detailed forecasting. Our current\ncomputations show that for energy injection because of (ii) and (iv) Pixie\nshould allow to improve existing limits, while the CMB distortions caused by\nthe other processes seem to remain unobservable with the currently proposed\nsensitivities and spectral bands of Pixie.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 15:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Here we report\nobservation of the gravitational redshift of light coming from galaxies in\nclusters at the 99 per cent confidence level, based upon archival data. The\nmeasurement agrees with the predictions of general relativity and its\nmodification created to explain cosmic acceleration without the need for dark\nenergy (f(R) theory), but is inconsistent with alternative models designed to\navoid the presence of dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 15:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

We show that the anomalous exponent depends on\ntime, according to the time-evolution of the number of the effective\nneighbouring sites. Transition from subdiffusive to normal transport at\nlong-enough time is recovered. The above result indicates that the spatial\nstructure, specifically the network structure, of the hopping sites might be a\nnovel element which determines the anomalous exponent. This leads to the\nfeature that the scaling property of the electric transport to time is\ninsensitive to other elements, such as the distance of the sites or the spatial\ndimension of the system. These findings are verified by means of Monte Carlo\nsimulation. The relation of the result to the conventional knowledge of the\nMultiple Trapping Model is shown by deriving it as a special case of the\ndisorder model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 00:18:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 00:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}

Crystalline quartz (SiO2) and boron nitride (BN) dielectrics\nwere considered. Crystalline approximation to the amorphous quartz allows to\nstudy the effect of oxygen coverage or environmental effects on the surface\nstates degradation which has gained attention recently in the experimental\ncommunity. We considered both symmetric and asymmetric dielectric cappings to\nthe sufaces of TI thin films. Our studies suggest that BN and quartz cappings\nhave negligible effects on the Dirac cone surface states of both binary and\nternary TIs, except in the case of an oxygen-terminated quartz surface.\nDangling bond states of oxygens in oxygen-terminated quartz dominate the region\nclose to Fermi level, thereby distorting the TI Dirac cone feature and burying\nthe Dirac point in the quartz valence band region. Passivating the\noxygen-terminated surface with atomic hydrogen removes these dangling bond\nstates from the Fermi surface region, and consequently the clear Dirac cone is\nrecovered. Our results are consistent with recent experimental studies of TI\nsurface degradation in the presence of oxygen coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 14:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}
