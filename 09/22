In this work, we present a model for the small-scale\ndynamo that takes into account the slope of the turbulent velocity spectrum\nv(l) ~ l^theta, where l and v(l) are the size of a turbulent fluctuation and\nthe typical velocity on that scale. The time evolution of the fluctuation\ncomponent of the magnetic field, i.e., the small-scale field, is described by\nthe Kazantsev equation. We solve this linear differential equation for its\neigenvalues with the quantum-mechanical WKB-approximation. The validity of this\nmethod is estimated as a function of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. We\ncalculate the minimal magnetic Reynolds number for dynamo action, Rm_crit,\nusing our model of the turbulent velocity correlation function. For Kolmogorov\nturbulence (theta=1/3), we find that the critical magnetic Reynolds number is\napproximately 110 and for Burgers turbulence (theta=1/2) approximately 2700.\nFurthermore, we derive that the growth rate of the small-scale magnetic field\nfor a general type of turbulence is Gamma ~ Re^((1-theta)/(1+theta)) in the\nlimit of infinite magnetic Prandtl numbers. For decreasing magnetic Prandtl\nnumber (down to Pm approximately larger than 10), the growth rate of the\nsmall-scale dynamo decreases. The details of this drop depend on the\nWKB-approximation, which becomes invalid for a magnetic Prandtl number of about\nunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 16:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 18:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We aim to extend our previous work on the origin of spectral\nlags, using the duration-luminosity relation recently discovered by Hakkila et\nal. to connect lags and luminosity. We also present a way to test this relation\nwhich has originally been established with a limited sample of only 12 pulses.\nWe relate lags to the spectral evolution and shape of the pulses with a linear\nexpansion of the pulse properties around maximum. We then couple this first\nresult to the duration-luminosity relation to obtain the lag-luminosity and\nlag-duration relations. We finally use a Monte-Carlo method to generate a\npopulation of synthetic GRB pulses which is then used to check the validity of\nthe duration-luminosity relation. Our theoretical results for the lag and\nduration-luminosity relations are in good agreement with the data. They are\nrather insensitive to the assumptions regarding the burst spectral parameters.\nOur Monte Carlo analysis of a population of synthetic pulses confirms that the\nduration-luminosity relation must be satisfied to reproduce the observational\nduration-peak flux diagram of BATSE GRB pulses. The newly discovered\nduration-luminosity relation offers the possibility to link all three\nquantities: lag, duration and luminosity of GRB pulses in a consistent way.\nSome evidence for its validity have been presented but its origin is not easy\nto explain in the context of the internal shock model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 16:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In\nRSR the network is locally coarse grained by choosing at each renormalization\nstep a node at random and joining it to all its neighbors. Compared to previous\n(quasi-)parallel renormalization methods [C.Song et.al], RSR allows a more\nfine-grained analysis of the renormalization group (RG) flow, and unravels new\nfeatures, that were not discussed in the previous analyses. In particular we\nfind that all networks exhibit a second order transition in their RG flow. This\nphase transition is associated with the emergence of a giant hub and can be\nviewed as a new variant of percolation, called agglomerative percolation. We\nclaim that this transition exists also in previous graph renormalization\nschemes and explains some of the scaling laws seen there. For critical trees it\nhappens as N/N0 -> 0 in the limit of large systems (where N0 is the initial\nsize of the graph and N its size at a given RSR step). In contrast, it happens\nat finite N/N0 in sparse ER graphs and in the annealed model, while it happens\nfor N/N0 -> 1 on scale-free networks. Critical exponents seem to depend on the\ntype of the graph but not on the average degree and obey usual scaling\nrelations for percolation phenomena. For the annealed model they agree with the\nexponents obtained from a mean-field theory. At late times, the networks\nexhibit a star-like structure in agreement with the results of Radicchi et. al.\nWhile degree distributions are of main interest when regarding the scheme as\nnetwork renormalization, mass distributions (which are more relevant when\nconsidering 'supernodes' as clusters) are much easier to study using the fast\nNewman-Ziff algorithm for percolation, allowing us to obtain very high\nstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 19:10:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 06:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

Virial M_BH estimates based on H_beta are available\nfrom the COSMOS Magellan/IMACS survey. We use high-resolution Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) imaging to decompose the light of each type-1 AGN and host\ngalaxy, and employ a specially-built mass-to-light ratio to estimate the\nstellar masses (M_*). The M_BH-M_* ratio shows a zero offset with respect to\nthe local relation for galactic bulge masses, and we also find no evolution in\nthe mass ratio M_BH/M_*=(1+z)^{0.02+-0.34} up to z~0.9. Interestingly, at the\nhigh-M_BH end there is a positive offset from the z=0 relation, which can be\nfully explained by a mass function bias with a cosmic scatter of 0.3,\nreaffirming that the intrinsic distribution is consistent with zero evolution.\nFrom our results we conclude that since z~0.9 no substantial addition of\nstellar mass is required: the decline in star formation rates and merger\nactivity at z<1 support this scenario.

This is achieved by summarizing the efficiencies of\naccretion, cooling, star formation, and feedback given by the HYD, as functions\nof the halo mass and redshift. Surprisingly, by turning the HYD into a SAM, we\nconserve the mass of individual galaxies, with deviations at the level of 0.1\ndex, on an object-by-object basis. This is true for all redshifts, and for the\nmass of stars and gas components, although the agreement reaches 0.2 dex for\nsatellite galaxies at low redshift. We show that the same level of accuracy is\nobtained even in case the SAM uses only one phase of gas within each galaxy.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the formation history of one massive galaxy\nprovides sufficient information for the SAM to reproduce the population of\ngalaxies within the entire cosmological box. The reasons for the small scatter\nbetween the HYD and SAM galaxies are: a) The efficiencies are matched as\nfunctions of the halo mass and redshift, meaning that the evolution within\nmerger-trees agrees on average. b) For a given galaxy, efficiencies fluctuate\naround the mean value on time scales of 0.2-2 Gyr. c) The various mass\ncomponents of galaxies are obtained by integrating the efficiencies over time,\naveraging out these fluctuations. We compare the efficiencies found here to\nstandard SAM recipes and find that they often deviate significantly. For\nexample, here the HYD shows smooth accretion that is less effective for low\nmass haloes, and is always composed of hot or dilute gas; cooling is less\neffective at high redshift; and star formation changes only mildly with cosmic\ntime. The method developed here can be applied in general to any HYD, and can\nthus serve as a common language for both HYDs and SAM (Abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 16:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In the CD scenario the rapidly rotating WD is formed shortly\nafter the stellar formation episode, and the delay from stellar formation to\nexplosion is basically determined by the spin-down time of the rapidly rotating\nmerger remnant. The spin-down is due to the magneto-dipole radiation torque.\nSeveral properties of the CD scenario make it attractive compared with the\ndouble-degenerate (DD) scenario.

With simple\nassumptions on the growth rate of the solutions of the original system, we show\nthat the perturbed system has a fundamental set of solutions with the same\nbehavior at infinity, employing a variation-of-constants scheme to produce a\nconvergent iteration for the solutions of the second equation in terms of those\nof the original one.

In a recent paper, Martin and O'Bryant investigated the distribution of\n|A+A| given the uniform distribution on subsets A of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. They\nalso conjectured the existence of a limiting distribution for |A+A| and showed\nthat the expectation of |A+A| is 2n - 11 + O((3/4)^{n/2}). Zhao proved that the\nlimits m(k) := lim_{n --> oo} Prob(2n-1-|A+A|=k) exist, and that sum_{k >= 0}\nm(k)=1.\n  We continue this program and give exponentially decaying upper and lower\nbounds on m(k), and sharp bounds on m(k) for small k. Surprisingly, the\ndistribution is at least bimodal; sumsets have an unexpected bias against\nmissing exactly 7 sums. The proof of the latter is by reduction to questions on\nthe distribution of related random variables, with large scale numerical\ncomputations a key ingredient in the analysis. We also derive an explicit\nformula for the variance of |A+A| in terms of Fibonacci numbers, finding\nVar(|A+A|) is approximately 35.9658. New difficulties arise in the form of weak\ndependence between events of the form {x in A+A}, {y in A+A}. We surmount these\nobstructions by translating the problem to graph theory.

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves\nin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves\nthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By\ncontrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since\nthe tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We\nderive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries,\ntaking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different\ntidal forcing components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 04:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 04:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The discs are\nfound to be spectrally stable. The great variety of possible initial conditions\nleads to three regimes of non-exponential growth of perturbations, which are\nclassified according to different relative levels of the in-plane and axial\nperturbed velocities. The first two regimes of instability are characterized by\nthe decoupling of the magneto-sonic (MS) and inertia-Coriolis (IC) modes, as\nwell as by algebraic temporal growth of the perturbations, which are driven by\neither MS or IC modes (hereafter MS - and IC -regimes of instability,\nrespectively). The third, mixed IC-MS regime of non-exponential, non-algebraic\ngrowth is due only to nonaxisymmetric perturbations. The latter regime is\ncharacterized by high radial and azimuthal wavenumbers, and growth time of the\norder of tens of rotating periods. The mixed IC-MS regime most likely exhibits\nthe maximal growth as compared with the IC- and MS- regimes. In the first two\nregimes of instability the compressible MS mode plays a principal role either\nas the driver of the growth or the driven growing mode, while the mixed IC-MS\nregime is described by the Bousinesq approximation for incompressible fluid.\nThe latter is obtained as a natural limit of the expansion scheme. The presence\nof magnetic field in the mixed IC- MS regime may drastically increase the\ngrowth rates of the perturbations as compared with the pure hydrodynamic\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 07:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This result is obtained by: (a) solving equations for\ncorrelation functions, which yields the evolution $k_0 \\mapsto k_t$, $t\\in\n[0,T)$, in a scale of Banach spaces; (b) proving that each $k_t$ is a\ncorrelation function for a unique measure $\\mu_t$. The mesoscopic theory is\nbased on a Vlasov-type scaling, that yields a mean-field-like approximate\ndescription in terms of the particles' density which obeys a kinetic equation.\nThe latter equation is rigorously derived from that for the correlation\nfunctions by the scaling procedure. We prove that the kinetic equation has a\nunique solution $\\varrho_t$, $t\\in [0,+\\infty)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 09:52:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2012 09:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

Faraday\nRotation gradients are a very important way of investigating these magnetic\nfields, and can provide information on the orientation and structure of the\nmagnetic field in the immediate vicinity of the jet; for example, a toroidal or\nhelical field component should give rise to a systematic gradient in the\nobserved Faraday rotation across the jet, as well as characteristic intensity\nand polarization profiles. However, real observed radio images have finite\nresolution, usually expressed via convolution with a Gaussian beam whose size\ncorresponds to the central lobe of the point source response function. This\nwill tend to blur transverse structure in the jet profile, raising the question\nof how well resolved a jet must be in the transverse direction in order to\nreliably detect transverse structure associated with a helical jet magnetic\nfield.

Proposed causes such as shortages of grain due to\nadverse weather, increasing meat consumption in China and India, conversion of\ncorn to ethanol in the US, and investor speculation on commodity markets lead\nto widely differing implications for policy. A lack of clarity about which\nfactors are responsible reinforces policy inaction. Here, for the first time,\nwe construct a dynamic model that quantitatively agrees with food prices. The\nresults show that the dominant causes of price increases are investor\nspeculation and ethanol conversion. Models that just treat supply and demand\nare not consistent with the actual price dynamics. The two sharp peaks in\n2007/2008 and 2010/2011 are specifically due to investor speculation, while an\nunderlying upward trend is due to increasing demand from ethanol conversion.\nThe model includes investor trend following as well as shifting between\ncommodities, equities and bonds to take advantage of increased expected\nreturns. Claims that speculators cannot influence grain prices are shown to be\ninvalid by direct analysis of price setting practices of granaries. Both causes\nof price increase, speculative investment and ethanol conversion, are promoted\nby recent regulatory changes---deregulation of the commodity markets, and\npolicies promoting the conversion of corn to ethanol. Rapid action is needed to\nreduce the impacts of the price increases on global hunger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 19:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-23"}
