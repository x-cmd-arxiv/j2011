For the\npurpose of exposition, we study the classic three-node Gaussian relay channel\nwith decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, in which the source and relay nodes\ntransmit with power drawn from energy-harvesting (EH) sources. Assuming a\ndeterministic EH model under which the energy arrival time and the harvested\namount are known prior to transmission, the throughput maximization problem\nover a finite horizon of $N$ transmission blocks is investigated. In\nparticular, two types of data traffic with different delay constraints are\nconsidered: delay-constrained (DC) traffic (for which only one-block decoding\ndelay is allowed at the destination) and no-delay-constrained (NDC) traffic\n(for which arbitrary decoding delay up to $N$ blocks is allowed). For the DC\ncase, we show that the joint source and relay power allocation over time is\nnecessary to achieve the maximum throughput, and propose an efficient algorithm\nto compute the optimal power profiles. For the NDC case, although the\nthroughput maximization problem is non-convex, we prove the optimality of a\nseparation principle for the source and relay power allocation problems, based\nupon which a two-stage power allocation algorithm is developed to obtain the\noptimal source and relay power profiles separately. Furthermore, we compare the\nDC and NDC cases, and obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions under\nwhich the NDC case performs strictly better than the DC case. It is shown that\nNDC transmission is able to exploit a new form of diversity arising from the\nindependent source and relay energy availability over time in cooperative\ncommunication, termed \"energy diversity\", even with time-invariant channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2011 16:25:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 22:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The two key dimensionless parameters are the\nLundquist number and the macrosopic system size in units of the ion sound\ngyroradius. In addition to the conventional single X-line collisional and\ncollisionless phases, multiple X-line reconnection phases arise due to the\npresence of the plasmoid instability either in collisional and collisionless\ncurrent sheets. In particular, there exists a unique phase termed \"multiple\nX-line hybrid phase\" where a hierarchy of collisional islands or plasmoids is\nterminated by a collisionless current sheet, resulting in a rapid coupling\nbetween the macroscopic and kinetic scales and a mixture of collisional and\ncollisionless dynamics. The new phases involving multiple X-lines and\ncollisionless physics may be important for the emerging applications of\nmagnetic reconnection to accelerate charged particles beyond their thermal\nspeeds. A large number of heliophysical and astrophysical plasmas are surveyed\nand grouped in the phase diagram: Earth's magnetosphere, solar plasmas\n(chromosphere, corona, wind and tachocline), galactic plasmas (molecular\nclouds, interstellar media, accretion disks and their coronae, Crab nebula, Sgr\nA*, gamma ray bursts, magnetars), extragalactic plasmas (Active Galactic Nuclei\ndisks and their coronae, galaxy clusters, radio lobes, and extragalactic jets).\nSignificance of laboratory experiments, including a next generation\nreconnection experiment, is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2011 21:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Tens of type-I X-ray bursts were found in this\noutburst. Joint observations provide sufficient data to look into the behavior\nof IGR J17473--2721 at the rising part of the outburst. We find that the joint\nenergy spectra can be well fitted with a model composed of a blackbody and a\ncutoff power-law, with a cutoff energy decreasing from $ \\sim$ 150 keV to\n$\\sim$ 40 keV as the source leaves the quiescent state toward the low hard\nstate. This fits into a scenario in which the corona is cooled by the soft\nX-rays along the outburst evolution, as observed in several other atoll\nsources. By using the flux measured in the 1.5--30 keV band of the type-I\nbursts during the outburst, we find that the linear relationship between the\nburst duration and the flux still holds for those bursts that occur at the\ndecaying part of the low hard state, but with a different slope than the\noverall one that was estimated with the bursts happening in the whole extent\nof, and for the rest of the low hard state. The significance of such a\ndichotomy in the type-I X-ray bursts is $\\sim$ 3 $\\sigma$ under an F-test.\nSimilar results are hinted at as well with the broader energy-band that was\nadopted recently. This dichotomy may be understood in a scenario where part of\nthe accreting material forms a corona on the way of falling onto the surface of\nthe neutron star during the decaying part of the low hard state. Based on the\naccretion rates of the preceding LHS, estimated from type-I X-ray bursts and\nfrom persistent emission, at least for IGR J17473-2721, most of the accretion\nmaterial may fall on the neutron star (NS) surface in the LHS.

Our low-resolution HI maps show\nthe disturbed HI morphology that NGC 5253 possesses, including tails, plumes\nand detached HI clouds. The high-resolution map reveals an HI plume at the SE\nand an HI structure at the NW that surrounds an Ha shell. We confirm that the\nkinematics of the neutral gas are highly perturbed and do not follow a rotation\npattern. We discuss the outflow and infall scenarios to explain such disturbed\nkinematics, analyze the environment in which it resides, and compare it\nproperties with those observed in similar star-forming dwarf galaxies. The\nradio-continuum emission of NGC 5253 is resolved and associated with the\nintense star-forming region at the center of the galaxy. We complete the\nanalysis using multiwavelength data extracted from the literature. We estimate\nthe SFR using this multiwavelength approach. NGC 5253 does not satisfy the\nSchmidt-Kennicutt law of star-formation, has a very low HI mass-to-light ratio\nwhen comparing with its stellar mass, and seems to be slightly metal-deficient\nin comparison with starbursts of similar baryonic mass. Taking into account all\navailable multiwavelength data, we conclude that NGC 5253 is probably\nexperiencing the infall of a diffuse, low-metallicity HI cloud along the minor\naxis of the galaxy, which is comprising the ISM and triggering the powerful\nstarburst. The tidally disturbed material observed at the east and north of the\ngalaxy is a consequence of this interaction, which probably started more than\n100 Myr ago. The origin of this HI cloud may be related with a strong\ninteraction between NGC 5253 and the late-type spiral galaxy M 83 in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 06:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

To answer this question, a notion that quantifies the determinative\npower of an input over the states of the nodes in the network is needed. We\nargue that the mutual information (MI) between a given subset of the inputs X =\n{X_1, ..., X_n} of some node i and its associated function f_i(X) quantifies\nthe determinative power of this set of inputs over node i. We compare the\ndeterminative power of a set of inputs to the sensitivity to perturbations to\nthese inputs, and find that, maybe surprisingly, an input that has large\nsensitivity to perturbations does not necessarily have large determinative\npower.

As an application of our results, we analyze the large-scale\nregulatory network of Escherichia coli.

These properties clarify three conditions, one of which is necessary\nand others are sufficient for the validity of Boltzmann formula. In the third,\nby combining the above results, we find a reasonable suggestion from the\nsufficient conditions that the potential of gravitational interaction among\nmicrostates of underlying quantum gravity may not diverge to negative infinity\n(such as Newtonian gravity) but is bounded below at a finite length scale. In\naddition to that, from the necessary condition, the interaction has to be\nrepulsive within the finite length scale. The length scale should be Planck\nsize.

One of systems we\nuse for this purpose generates a $\\chi^{(9)}$ absorption resonance that is\nobservable on the same trace that shows linear features, in an experiment\ndescribed in a previous work but the order of nonlinearity newly interpreted\nusing this work.This high order nonlinearity should be very sensitive to cross\nfield correlations.We show how it can be used to test our conjecture of\nasymmetric processes.\n  We also come across an important $\\chi^{(5)}$ absorption,comparable to linear\nabsorption, that is anomalous.The anomaly is that the Imaginary part of this\nXPM nonlinearity can cause squeezing.We give a qualitative argument which shows\nthat we don't expect the Imaginary part of the XPM nonlinearities we usually\ncome across, to cause squeezing.This promising source of squeezing, is\nqualitatively different from the other sources hitherto known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 11:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 07:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2011 13:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 03:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 13:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 01:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 1 May 2016 12:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

Then a\nLax pair is constructed with the improved current and the classical\nintegrability is shown by deriving the r/s-matrix algebra. In the latter 2), we\nfind a non-local current by using a scaling limit of warped AdS_3 and that it\nenhances U(1)_R to a q-deformed Poincare algebra. Then another Lax pair is\npresented and the corresponding r/s-matrices are also computed. The two\ndescriptions are equivalent via a non-local map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 12:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 09:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

High-energy CRs that escape from the forward shock\n(FS) are propagated in surrounding dense material that simulates either a\nswept-up, pre-supernova shell or a nearby molecular cloud. The continuum\nemission from trapped and escaping CRs, along with the thermal X-ray emission\nfrom the shocked heated ISM behind the FS, integrated over the remnant, is\ncompared against broadband observations. Our results show conclusively that,\noverall, the GeV-TeV emission is dominated by inverse-Compton from CR electrons\nif the supernova is isolated regardless of its type, i.e., not interacting with\na >>100 Msun shell or cloud. If the SNR is interacting with a much larger mass\n>10^4 Msun, pion-decay from the escaping CRs may dominate the TeV emission,\nalthough a precise fit at high energy will depend on the still uncertain\ndetails of how the highest energy CRs are accelerated by, and escape from, the\nFS.

Object detection in a video is usually performed by object\ndetectors or background subtraction techniques. Often, an object detector\nrequires manually labeled examples to train a binary classifier, while\nbackground subtraction needs a training sequence that contains no objects to\nbuild a background model. To automate the analysis, object detection without a\nseparate training phase becomes a critical task. People have tried to tackle\nthis task by using motion information. But existing motion-based methods are\nusually limited when coping with complex scenarios such as nonrigid motion and\ndynamic background. In this paper, we show that above challenges can be\naddressed in a unified framework named DEtecting Contiguous Outliers in the\nLOw-rank Representation (DECOLOR). This formulation integrates object detection\nand background learning into a single process of optimization, which can be\nsolved by an alternating algorithm efficiently. We explain the relations\nbetween DECOLOR and other sparsity-based methods.

There are several evidences\nthat for extended systems this DMFT+DFT approach is more accurate than the\ntraditional DFT+U approximation, particularly because of its ability to take\ninto account dynamical effects, such as the time-resolved double occupancy of\nthe electronic orbitals.

Using filters covering a wide range of\nwavelengths, our HST photometry splits the main sequence (MS) into two\nbranches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant and\nred-giant regions (SGB, RGB), and on the horizontal branch (HB). We calculate\ntheoretical stellar atmospheres for MS stars, assuming different chemical\ncomposition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the HST\nfilters with our observed colors. We find that we can match the complex of\nobserved colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance and\nanother with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but with\ndepleted C and O. We confirm that models of RGB and red HB stars with that pair\nof compositions also give colors that fit our observations. We suggest that the\ndifferent strengths of molecular bands of OH, CN, CH and NH, falling in\ndifferent photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the two\npopulations. Near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitude\ndiagram (CMD) the population with primeval abundances makes up only ~20% of the\nstars, a fraction that increases outwards, approachng equality in the outskirts\nof the cluster, with a fraction ~30% averaged over the whole cluster. Thus the\nsecond, He/N-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes the\nmajority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. We present evidence\nthat the CMD of 47 Tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the two\npopulations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the MS\nup to the RGB, and thence to the HB. A third population is visible only in the\nSGB, where it includes ~8% of the stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 13:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

On this basis, a heuristic method for evaluating\nWikipedia entries is developed and applied to Wikipedia articles that scored\nhighly in a search engine retrieval effectiveness test and compared with the\nrelevance judgment of jurors. In all search engines tested, Wikipedia results\nare unanimously judged better by the jurors than other results on the\ncorresponding results position.

Both terms give rise to\nexchange potentials, which sum up to the screened nonlocal exchange potential\nof HSE. We evaluate the former with the help of an auxiliary basis, defined in\nsuch a way that the bare Coulomb matrix becomes sparse.

It is thus\ninteresting to have an alternative method to constrain the value of the\nobliquity and to detect companions that might have disturbed the orbit of the\nplanet. We show how the long-term variations in the transit duration (TDV) can\nbe used to constrain the obliquity of the stellar rotation axis. We introduce a\nsimple theory to express the secular variations in the orbital elements and\ntheir effects on the TDVs with a general formulation valid for both oblique and\neccentric systems. Parameters or orbital elements that cannot be directly\nmeasured, such as the longitude of the ascending node of the orbit, are avoided\nthus allowing us a straightforward application. We compute the expected TDVs\nfor the presently known transiting systems, adopting their parameters found in\nthe literature. Considering the capabilities of the present or next generation\nspace-borne telescopes, we point out the systems that could be readily observed\nand discuss the constraints derivable on their fundamental parameters. TDVs can\nbe used to constrain the obliquity of the stars (and possibly of the planets in\nsystems younger than 10 -- 100 Myr), giving information about the formation\nscenarios, the strength of the tidal coupling, and the internal structure of\nboth the stars and the planets. Moreover, they can provide an indirect\nindication of the presence of other bodies, even with a mass comparable with\nthat of the Earth, because they give rise to additional contributions to the\nnodal precession.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 15:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 17:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

A\ntheorem of Karshon and Tolman says that such a manifold is equivariantly\nsymplectomorphic to a particular subset of R^2D. This fact enables us to\nconstruct symplectic embeddings of balls into certain coadjoint orbits of the\nunitary group, and therefore obtain a lower bound for their Gromov width. Using\nthe identification of the dual of the Lie algebra of the unitary group with the\nspace of (n x n) Hermitian matrices, the main theorem states that for a\ncoadjoint orbit through \\lambda=diag(\\lambda_1, ..., \\lambda_n) in the dual of\nthe Lie algebra of the unitary group, where at most one eigenvalue is repeated,\nthe lower bound for Gromov width is equal to the minimum of the differences\n\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j, over all \\lambda_i>\\lambda_j.

The bispectrum\nis the lowest-order statistic providing an estimate for non-Gaussianities of a\ndistribution, and the bispectrum covariance depicts the errors of the\nbispectrum measurement and their correlation on different scales. Currently,\nthere do exist fitting formulae for the bispectrum and an analytical expression\nfor the bispectrum covariance, but the former is not very accurate and the\nlatter contains several intricate terms and only one of them can be readily\nevaluated from the power spectrum of the studied field. Neglecting all\nhigher-order terms results in the Gaussian approximation of the bispectrum\ncovariance. We study the range of validity of this Gaussian approximation for\ntwo-dimensional non-Gaussian random fields. For this purpose, we simulate\nGaussian and non-Gaussian random fields, the latter represented by log-normal\nfields and obtained directly from the former by a simple transformation. From\nthe simulated fields, we calculate the power spectra, the bispectra, and the\ncovariance from the sample variance of the bispectra, for different degrees of\nnon-Gaussianity \\alpha, which is equivalent to the skewness on a given angular\nscale \\theta g. We find that the Gaussian approximation provides a good\napproximation for \\alpha<0.6 and a reasonably accurate approximation for\n\\alpha< 1, both on scales >8\\theta g. Using results from cosmic shear\nsimulations, we estimate that the cosmic shear convergence fields are described\nby \\alpha<0.7 at \\theta g~4\". We therefore conclude that the Gaussian\napproximation for the bispectrum covariance is likely to be applicable in\nongoing and future cosmic shear studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 15:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
