It\nwas found that the model demonstrates a counter-example to the cosmic no-hair\ntheorem since there exists a stable anisotropically inflationary fix-point. One\nof the great triumphs of inflation, however, is that it explains the observed\nflatness and isotropy of the universe today without requiring special initial\nconditions. Any acceptable model for inflation should thus explain these\nobservations in a satisfactory way. To check whether the model meets this\nrequirement, we introduce curvature to the background geometry and consider\naxisymmetric spacetimes of Bianchi type II,III and the Kantowski-Sachs metric.\nWe show that the anisotropic Bianchi type I fix-point is an attractor for the\nentire family of such spacetimes. The model is predictive in the sense that the\nuniverse gets close to this fix-point after a few e-folds for a wide range of\ninitial conditions. If inflation lasts for N e-folds, the curvature at the end\nof inflation is typically of order exp(-2N). The anisotropy in the expansion\nrate at the end of inflation, on the other hand, while being small on the\none-percent level, is highly significant. We show that after the end of\ninflation there will be a period of isotropization lasting for about 2N/3\ne-folds. After that the shear scales as the curvature and becomes dominant\naround N e-folds after the end of inflation. For plausible bounds on the reheat\ntemperature the minimum number of e-folds during inflation, required for\nconsistency with the isotropy of the supernova Ia data, lays in the interval\n(21,48). Thus the results obtained for our restricted class of spacetimes\nindicates that inflation with anisotropic hair is cosmologically viable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 21:36:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 00:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

Using an ensemble of N-body\nsimulations, we apply several statistical methods to estimate the parameters.\nWe measure halo and matter fluctuations smoothed on various scales and find\nthat the parameters vary with smoothing scale. We argue that, for real-space\nmeasurements, owing to the mixing of wavemodes, no scale can be found for which\nthe parameters are independent of smoothing. However, this is not the case in\nFourier space. We measure halo power spectra and construct estimates for an\neffective large-scale bias. We measure the configuration dependence of the halo\nbispectra B_hhh and reduced bispectra Q_hhh for very large-scale k-space\ntriangles. From this we constrain b_1 and b_2.

Analysis of the Hertzsprung Russell diagram\nsuggests that the Nishiyama extinction law fits the stellar population of W3\nMain best (E(J-H)/E(H-Ks) = 1.76 and R_(Ks) = 1.44). From our\nspectrophotometric analysis of the massive stars and the nature of their\nsurrounding HII regions we derive the evolutionary sequence of W3 Main and we\nfind evidence of an age spread of at least 2-3 Myr. While the most massive star\n(IRS2) is already evolved, indications for high-mass pre-main-sequence\nevolution is found for another star (IRS N1), deeply embedded in an ultra\ncompact HII region, in line with the different evolutionary phases observed in\nthe corresponding HII regions. We derive a stellar mass of W3 Main of (4 +- 1)\n10^3 Msun, by extrapolating from the number of OB stars using a Kroupa IMF and\ncorrecting for our spectroscopic incompleteness. We have detected the\nphotospheres of OB stars from the more evolved diffuse HII region to the much\nyounger UCHII regions, suggesting that these stars have finished their\nformation and cleared away their circumstellar disks very fast. Only in the\nhyper-compact HII region (IRS5), the early type stars seem to be still\nsurrounded by circumstellar material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 20:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The\nhot spot properties are thus variable on timescales exceeding the rotation\nperiod, maybe due to long-term changes in the accretion rate or geometry. The\nnew constraints from the analysis of the variability confirm that FU Tau A is\naffected by magnetically induced spots and excess luminosity from accretion.\nHowever, accretion is not sufficient to explain its anomalous position in the\nHR diagram.

However, at late epochs and small scales,\ncosmological density fields become highly non-Gaussian. The power spectrum\nloses power to describe LSS and CMB fields on small scales, most obviously\nthrough high covariance in the power spectrum as a function of scale.\nPractically, this significantly degrades constraints that observations can\nplace on cosmological parameters.

This result provides a justification for the use of the finite\ninterval boundary value problem in numerical studies for the half line problem.\nFurthermore, we extend the classical central schemes for the hyperbolic\nconservation laws to solve the MBL equation which is of pseudo-parabolic type.\nNumerical results confirm the existence of non-monotone water saturation\nprofiles consisting of constant states separated by shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 20:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-19"}

A transient astrophysical event observed in both gravitational wave\n(GW) and electromagnetic (EM) channels would yield rich scientific rewards. A\nfirst program initiating EM follow-ups to possible transient GW events has been\ndeveloped and exercised by the LIGO and Virgo community in association with\nseveral partners. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the methods used to\npromptly identify and localize GW event candidates and to request images of\ntargeted sky locations.\n  Methods. During two observing periods (Dec 17 2009 to Jan 8 2010 and Sep 2 to\nOct 20 2010), a low-latency analysis pipeline was used to identify GW event\ncandidates and to reconstruct maps of possible sky locations. A catalog of\nnearby galaxies and Milky Way globular clusters was used to select the most\npromising sky positions to be imaged, and this directional information was\ndelivered to EM observatories with time lags of about thirty minutes. A Monte\nCarlo simulation has been used to evaluate the low-latency GW pipeline's\nability to reconstruct source positions correctly.\n  Results. For signals near the detection threshold, our low-latency algorithms\noften localized simulated GW burst signals to tens of square degrees, while\nneutron star/neutron star inspirals and neutron star/black hole inspirals were\nlocalized to a few hundred square degrees. Localization precision improves for\nmoderately stronger signals. The correct sky location of signals well above\nthreshold and originating from nearby galaxies may be observed with ~50% or\nbetter probability with a few pointings of wide-field telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 21:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 20:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The system has\nstraightforward applications to two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and to\nthe bimodal light propagation in nonlinear optics. In the former case, the two\ncomponents represent different hyperfine atomic states, while in the latter\nsetting they correspond to orthogonal polarizations of light. Conditions\nguaranteeing the stability of flat continuous wave (CW) asymmetric bimodal\nstates are established, followed by the study of families of the corresponding\nDW patterns. Approximate analytical solutions for the DWs are found near the\npoint of the symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the CW states. An exact DW\nsolution is produced for ratio 3:1 of the XPM and SPM coefficients. The DWs\nbetween flat asymmetric states, which are mirror images to each other, are\ncompletely stable, and all other species of the DWs, with zero crossings in one\nor two components, are fully unstable. Interactions between two DWs are\nconsidered too, and an effective potential accounting for the attraction\nbetween them is derived analytically. Direct simulations demonstrate merger and\nannihilation of the interacting DWs. The analysis is extended for the system\nincluding single- and double-peak external potentials. Generic solutions for\ntrapped DWs are obtained in a numerical form, and their stability is\ninvestigated. An exact stable solution is found for the DW trapped by a\nsingle-peak potential. In the 2D geometry, stable two-component vortices are\nfound, with topological charges s=1,2,3. Radial oscillations of annular\nDW-shaped pulsons, with s=0,1,2, are studied too. A linear relation between the\nperiod of the oscillations and the mean radius of the DW ring is derived\nanalytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 23:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

However, analyzing the diversity of BICMB-OFDM is a\nchallenging problem. In this paper, the diversity analysis of BICMB-OFDM is\ncarried out. First, the maximum achievable diversity is derived and a full\ndiversity condition RcSL <= 1 is proved, where Rc, S, and L are the code rate,\nthe number of parallel steams transmitted at each subcarrier, and the number of\nchannel taps, respectively. Then, the performance degradation due to the\ncorrelation among subcarriers is investigated.

We obtained magnetically\nsupported (low-{\\beta}) disk solutions, whose luminosity exceeds the maximum\nluminosity for an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), L > 0.4 {\\alpha}^2\nL_Edd, where L_Edd is the Eddington luminosity. The accretion flow is composed\nof the outer ADAF, a luminous hot accretion flow (LHAF) inside the transition\nlayer from the outer ADAF to the low-{\\beta} disk, the low-{\\beta} disk, and\nthe inner ADAF. The low-{\\beta} disk region becomes wider as the mass-accretion\nrate increases further. In the low-{\\beta} disk, the magnetic heating balances\nthe radiative cooling, and the electron temperature decreases from ~ 10^9.5 K\nto ~ 10^8 K as the luminosity increases. These results are consistent with the\nanti-correlation between the energy cutoff in X-ray spectra (hence the electron\ntemperature) and the luminosity when L > 0.1 L_Edd, observed in the bright/hard\nstate during the bright hard-to-soft transitions of transient outbursts in\ngalactic black hole candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 05:17:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2012 08:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Applying this approach we demonstrate that the presence\nof incommensurate spin density waves induces real-space inhomogeneity of the\nsuperconducting order parameter even in the absence of external magnetic field.\nIn this case a homogeneous order parameter of the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-type superconducting state is slightly modulated, or\nequivalently, a small fraction of the charge carriers form Cooper pairs with\nnon-zero total momentum. However, when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is\napplied, the homogeneous component of the order parameter is suppressed and the\nsystem transits to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, where the\norder parameter oscillates changing sign.

New measurements from the FINUDA experiment on 7Li, 9Be, 13C and 16O,\ncoupled with previous measurements on 12C and 16O, allowed for the first time\nthe study of the formation of hypernuclei as a function of the atomic mass\nnumber A. The new measurements also offered the possibility of disentangling\nthe effects due to atomic wave-function of the captured K- from those due to\nthe pion optical nuclear potential and from those due to the specific\nhypernuclear states. These new results on the study of the hypernuclei\nproduction by K- at rest are here presented and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 08:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-19"}

We describe hypotheses on the dynamic\nenvironment that allow random walks to meet the important property that the\ntoken visits any node infinitely often. The randomness of this scheme allows it\nto work on any topology, and require no adaptation after a topological change,\nwhich is a desirable property for applications to dynamic systems. For random\nwalks to be a traversal scheme and to answer the concurrence problem, one needs\nto guarantee that exactly one token circulates in the system. In the presence\nof transient failures, configurations with multiple tokens or with no token can\noccur. The meeting property of random walks solves the cases with multiple\ntokens. The reloading wave mechanism we propose, together with timeouts, allows\nto detect and solve cases with no token. This traversal scheme is\nself-stabilizing, and universal, meaning that it needs no assumption on the\nsystem topology. We describe conditions on the dynamicity (with a local\ndetection criterion) under which the algorithm is tolerant to dynamic\nreconfigurations.

However, using\nrealistic, fully line-blanketed atmospheres at solar abundances, the key role\nof DR controlling these emission features is superseded -- for O-star\nconditions -- by the strength of the stellar wind and metallicity. In the case\nof wind-free models, the resulting lower ionizing EUV-fluxes severely suppress\nthe emission. As the mass-loss rate is increased, pumping through the NIII\nresonance line(s) in the presence of a near-photospheric velocity field results\nin a net optical triplet line emission. A comparison with results from CMFGEN\nis mostly satisfactory, except for the range 30 kK < Teff < 35 kK, where CMFGEN\ntriggers the triplet emission at lower Teff than FASTWIND. This effect could be\ntraced down to line overlap effects between the NIII and OIII resonance lines\nthat so far cannot be simulated by FASTWIND.\n  Since the efficiency of DR and `two electron drain' strongly depends on the\ndegree of line-blanketing/-blocking, we predict the emission to become stronger\nin a metal-poor environment, though lower wind-strengths and Nitrogen\nabundances might counteract this effect. Weak winded stars should display less\ntriplet emission than stars with `normal' winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 12:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

These games have a high Price of\nAnarchy in their natural formulation. However, existing research applicable to\nspecific instances of these games has only been able to prove fast convergence\nto arbitrary equilibria. This paper studies general classes of covering and\npacking games with learning dynamics models that incorporate a central\nauthority who broadcasts weak, socially beneficial signals to agents that\notherwise only use local information in their decision-making. Rather than\nillustrating convergence to an arbitrary equilibrium that may have very high\nsocial cost, we show that these systems quickly achieve near-optimal\nperformance.\n  In particular, we show that in the public service advertising model, reaching\na small constant fraction of the agents is enough to bring the system to a\nstate within a log n factor of optimal in a broad class of set cover and set\npacking games or a constant factor of optimal in the special cases of vertex\ncover and maximum independent set, circumventing social inefficiency of bad\nlocal equilibria that could arise without a central authority. We extend these\nresults to the learn-then-decide model, in which agents use any of a broad\nclass of learning algorithms to decide in a given round whether to behave\naccording to locally optimal behavior or the behavior prescribed by the\nbroadcast signal. The new techniques we use for analyzing these games could be\nof broader interest for analyzing more general classic optimization problems in\na distributed fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 13:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-19"}

Its unusual spectral characteristics make it\na frequently used probe for intergalactic radiation and magnetic fields. With\nnew, simultaneous observations in the optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-rays, the\nsynchrotron emission is probed in great detail. The X-ray emission varies by a\nfactor of ~2 in 2009, while being rather stable in 2010. The X-ray spectrum is\nvery hard (\\Gamma ~ 1.8) and it shows an indication of excess absorption above\nthe Galactic value. The X-ray emission is detected up to ~100 keV without any\nsignificant cut-off, thus 1ES 0229+200 belongs to the class of extreme blazars.\nThe simultaneous measured, host galaxy- and extinction-corrected optical and UV\nfluxes illustrate that the cut-off of the low energy part of the synchrotron\nemission is located in the UV regime. The minimum energy of the electron\ndistribution has to be rather high to account for this cut-off. This implies\nthat there is a narrow-band energy distribution function of radiating\nelectrons, which is responsible for the unusually hard TeV spectrum. Other\nextreme blazars have similar synchrotron peak frequencies but much softer TeV\nspectra, hence 1ES 0229+200 has one of the highest inverse Compton (IC) peak\nfrequency and the narrowest electron distribution among the extreme blazars\nknown to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 14:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The first is\nduring the first fm/c of the collision, when gluons thermalize into the QGP.\nAfter a roughly isentropic expansion that roughly conserves the number of\nquarks, a second wave ensues at hadronization, 5-10 fm/c into the collision.\nSince each hadron contains at least two quarks, the majority of quark\nproduction occurs at this later time. For each quark produced in a heavy-ion\ncollision, an anti-quark of the same flavor is created at the same point in\nspace-time. Charge balance functions identify, on a statistical basis, the\nlocation of balancing charges for a given hadron, and given the picture above\none expects the distribution in relative rapidity of balancing charges to be\ncharacterized by two scales. After first demonstrating how charge balance\nfunctions can be created using any pair of hadronic states, it will be shown\nhow one can identify and study both processes of quark production. By\nconsidering balance functions of several hadronic species, and by performing\nillustrative calculations, this class of measurement appears to hold the\nprospect of providing the field's most stringent insight into the chemical\nevolution of the QGP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 15:30:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 14:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 22:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

DPSS's\nform a highly efficient basis for sampled bandlimited functions; by modulating\nand merging DPSS bases, we obtain a dictionary that offers high-quality sparse\napproximations for most sampled multiband signals.
