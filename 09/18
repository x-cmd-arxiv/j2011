While graphite has\nnon-polar homo-nuclear C-C intra-layer bonds, h-BN presents highly polar B-N\nbonds resulting in different optimal stacking modes of the two materials in\nbulk form. Furthermore, the static polarizabilities of the constituent atoms\nconsiderably differ from each other suggesting large differences in the\ndispersive component of the interlayer bonding. Despite these major differences\nboth materials present practically identical interlayer distances. To\nunderstand this finding, a comparative study of the nature of the interlayer\nbonding in both materials is presented. A full lattice sum of the interactions\nbetween the partially charged atomic centers in h-BN results in vanishingly\nsmall monopolar electrostatic contributions to the interlayer binding energy.\nHigher order electrostatic multipoles, exchange, and short-range correlation\ncontributions are found to be very similar in both materials and to almost\ncompletely cancel out by the Pauli repulsions at physically relevant interlayer\ndistances resulting in a marginal effective contribution to the interlayer\nbinding. Further analysis of the dispersive energy term reveals that despite\nthe large differences in the individual atomic polarizabilities the\nhetero-atomic B-N C6 coefficient is very similar to the homo-atomic C-C\ncoefficient in the hexagonal bulk form resulting in very similar dispersive\ncontribution to the interlayer binding. The overall binding energy curves of\nboth materials are thus very similar predicting practically the same interlayer\ndistance and very similar binding energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2011 19:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-16"}

The series of 25 runs were performed for each\nscenario. To maintain comparable accuracy of the reconstructions, during the\nfinal stages the only selection procedure we used was the biased one. This\nallowed us to make the consistent comparison of the first three scenarios. The\npurely random #2r approach of low efficiency was included only for completeness\nof the approaches. Finally, for the conditions established, the best single\nreconstruction and the best average tolerance value among all the scenarios\nwere given by the mixed #2m method, which was also the fastest one. The\nslightly slower the alternative #2b and #2rp variants provided comparable but\nless satisfactory results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2011 23:22:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 21:26:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2012 11:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-19"}

Given that rotating superfluids between two\nconcentric spheres have been verified to be dynamically unstable to non\naxi-symmetric perturbations, we conclude that the remnant energy stored in the\ncore would be sufficiently large to turn the flow turbulent and dissipative and\nsubsequently lead to core collapse bosonova.\n  The feasibility of a conversion mechanism of normal matter into bosonic\ncondensates under normal astrophysical conditions is discussed as well.\n  We finally conclude that in lack of a profound theory for quantum gravity,\nBHs should continue to be the favorite proposal for BH candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2011 23:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 22:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Second, the location\nof the peak of the Planck curve depends on the choice of the independent\nvariable in the plot. And third, Wien's displacement law is seldom used in\nactual practice to find a temperature and direct fitting to the Planck function\nis preferable. We discuss these flaws and argue that, at the introductory\nlevel, presentation of blackbody radiation in terms of photon statistics would\nbe more effective pedagogically.

Conventional generators\ncan be used to mitigate this variability but are costly to operate and produce\ncarbon emissions. Energy storage provides a more environmentally friendly\nalternative, but is costly to deploy in large amounts. This paper studies the\nlimits on the benefits of energy storage to renewable energy: How effective is\nstorage at mitigating the adverse effects of renewable energy variability? How\nmuch storage is needed? What are the optimal control policies for operating\nstorage? To provide answers to these questions, we first formulate the power\nflow in a single-bus power system with storage as an infinite horizon\nstochastic program. We find the optimal policies for arbitrary net renewable\ngeneration process when the cost function is the average conventional\ngeneration (environmental cost) and when it is the average loss of load\nprobability (reliability cost). We obtain more refined results by considering\nthe multi-timescale operation of the power system. We view the power flow in\neach timescale as the superposition of a predicted (deterministic) component\nand an prediction error (residual) component and formulate the residual power\nflow problem as an infinite horizon dynamic program. Assuming that the net\ngeneration prediction error is an IID process, we quantify the asymptotic\nbenefits of storage. With the additional assumption of Laplace distributed\nprediction error, we obtain closed form expressions for the stationary\ndistribution of storage and conventional generation. Finally, we propose a\ntwo-threshold policy that trades off conventional generation saving with loss\nof load probability. We illustrate our results and corroborate the IID and\nLaplace assumptions numerically using datasets from CAISO and NREL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2011 04:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 17:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-13"}

We used our currently available\ncatalog of distance measurements containing 1,797 galaxies within 3000 km/s:\nCosmicflows-1. The Wiener Filter method is used to recover the full 3D peculiar\nvelocity field from the observed map of radial velocities and to recover the\nunderlying linear density field. The velocity field within a data zone of 3000\nkm/s is decomposed into a local component that is generated within the data\nzone and a tidal one that is generated by the mass distribution outside that\nzone. The tidal component is characterized by a coherent flow toward the\nNorma-Hydra-Centaurus (Great Attractor) region while the local component is\ndominated by a flow toward the Virgo Cluster and away from the Local Void. A\ndetailed analysis shows that the local flow is predominantly governed by the\nLocal Void and the Virgo Cluster plays a lesser role. The analysis procedure\nwas tested against a mock catalog. It is demonstrated that the Wiener Filter\naccurately recovers the input velocity field of the mock catalog on the scale\nof the extraction of distances and reasonably recovers the velocity field on\nsignificantly larger scales. The Bayesian Wiener Filter reconstruction is\ncarried out within the ?CDM WMAP5 framework. The Wiener Filter reconstruction\ndraws particular attention to the importance of voids in proximity to our\nneighborhood. The prominent structure of the Local Supercluster is wrapped in a\nhorseshoe collar of under density with the Local Void as a major component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2011 09:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Knowing the column density in any direction\nat any location in space is a prerequisite for modelling the propagation of\nradiation through the computational domain. TreeCol therefore forms the basis\nfor a fast, approximate method for modelling the attenuation of radiation\nwithin large numerical simulations. It constructs a HEALPix sphere at any\ndesired location and accumulates the column density by walking the tree and by\nadding up the contributions from all tree nodes whose line of sight contributes\nto the pixel under consideration. In particular when combined with widely-used\ntree-based gravity solvers the new scheme requires little additional\ncomputational cost. In a simulation with $N$ resolution elements, the\ncomputational cost of TreeCol scales as $N \\log N$, instead of the $N^{5/3}$\nscaling of most other radiative transfer schemes. TreeCol is naturally\nadaptable to arbitrary density distributions and is easy to implement and to\nparallelize. We discuss its accuracy and performance characteristics for the\nexamples of a spherical protostellar core and for the turbulent interstellar\nmedium. We find that the column density estimates provided by TreeCol are on\naverage accurate to better than 10 percent. In another application, we compute\nthe dust temperatures for solar neighborhood conditions and compare with the\nresult of a full-fledged Monte Carlo radiation-transfer calculation. We find\nthat both methods give very similar answers. We conclude that TreeCol provides\na fast, easy to use, and sufficiently accurate method of calculating column\ndensities that comes with little additional computational cost when combined\nwith an existing tree-based gravity solver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2011 11:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This paper explores\nthe class of two-dimensional convolutional codes (2D CCs) and 2D tail-biting\nconvolutional codes (2D TBCCs), in particular, from several aspects. First, we\nderive several basic algebraic properties of these codes, applying algebraic\nmethods in order to find bijective encoders, create parity check matrices and\nto inverse encoders. Next, we discuss the minimum distance and weight\ndistribution properties of these codes. Extending an existing tree-search\nalgorithm to two dimensions, we apply it to find codes with high minimum\ndistance. Word-error probability asymptotes for sample codes are given and\ncompared with other codes. The results of this approach suggest that 2D TBCCs\ncan perform better than comparable 1D TBCCs or other codes. We then present\nseveral novel iterative suboptimal algorithms for soft decoding 2D CCs, which\nare based on belief propagation. Two main approaches to decoding are\nconsidered. We first focus on a decoder which extends the concept of trellis\ndecoding to two dimensions. Second, we investigate algorithms which use the\ncode's parity check matrices. We apply conventional BP in the parity domain,\nbut improve it with a novel modification. Next, we test the generalized belief\npropagation (GBP) algorithm. Performance results are presented and compared\nwith optimum decoding techniques and bounds. The results show that our\nsuboptimal algorithms achieve respectable results, in some cases coming as\nclose as 0.2dB from optimal (maximum-likelihood) decoding. However for some of\nthe codes there is still a large gap from the optimal decoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2011 14:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-20"}

For long chains with length $N$ larger than the\ncritical chain length $N_{c}$, at which the chain just fully occupies the\nnanochannel, the ejection for ring polymers is faster compared with linear\nchains of identical length due to a larger entropic pulling force; while for\nshort chains ($N<N_c$), it takes longer time for ring polymers to eject out of\nthe channel due to a longer distance to be diffused to reach the exit of the\nchannel before experiencing the entropic pulling force.

Namely, the neuron learns to be more prone to generate spikes given\nthose combinations of firing input neurons for which a previous spiking of the\nneuron had been followed by a positive global reward signal. The reward signal\nmay be mediated by certain modulatory hormones or neurotransmitters, e.g., the\ndopamine. More generally, a trial-and-error learning paradigm is suggested in\nwhich a global reward signal triggers long-term enhancement or weakening of a\nneuron's spiking response to the preceding neuronal input firing pattern. Thus,\nrewards provide a feedback pathway that informs neurons whether their spiking\nwas beneficial or detrimental for a particular input combination. The neuron's\nability to discern specific combinations of firing input neurons is achieved\nthrough a random or predetermined spatial distribution of input synapses on\ndendrites that creates synaptic clusters that represent various permutations of\ninput neurons. The corresponding dendritic segments, or the enclosed individual\nspines, are capable of being particularly excited, due to local sigmoidal\nthresholding involving voltage-gated channel conductances, if the segment's\nexcitatory and absence of inhibitory inputs are temporally coincident. Such\nnonlinear excitation corresponds to a particular firing combination of input\nneurons, and it is posited that the excitation strength encodes the\ncombinatorial memory and is regulated by long-term plasticity mechanisms. It is\nalso suggested that the spine calcium influx that may result from the\nspatiotemporal synaptic input coincidence may cause the spine head actin\nfilaments to undergo mechanical (muscle-like) contraction, with the ensuing\ncytoskeletal deformation transmitted to the axon initial segment where it\nmay...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2011 03:19:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2011 21:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 02:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2013 21:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 7 May 2017 22:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}
