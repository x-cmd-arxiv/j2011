Their\nstructure and existence conditions, as well as transitions between them are not\nunderstood even in the case of the 'model' polymer polyethylene (PE). For\nanalysis of polymorphism in polymer crystals, we consider the simplest possible\nmodel of polymer chain: an extended flat zigzag made of 'united' atoms\n(replacing CH2-groups in PE chain); the united atoms belonging to different\nzigzags interact via Lennard-Jones potential. Analysis of potential of\ninteraction between such zigzags allowed to predict the structure of five\npossible equilibrium lattices in polymer crystal built out of such zigzags.\nMolecular dynamics simulation of the crystal built out of flexible zigzags\nshowed that, depending on model parameters (dimensions of the zigzag and\nequilibrium distance of Lennard-Jones potential), one to three of these\nlattices are stable in bulk at low temperatures. We have determined the model\nparameters at which the existing stable lattices are analogous to the ones\nobserved in real PE and linear alkanes. The triclinic lattice has the lowest\npotential energy, then follows the monoclinic lattice, and the orthorhombic\nlattice has the highest energy, exactly as in full atomic (with hydrogens)\nmolecular dynamics models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 16:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-06"}

Light curves of all\ntransient events were reconstructed in the g_M, r_M, i_M and z_M filters and\nsubmitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possible\nsupernovae. Pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by light\ncurve shape criteria. Type Ia supernova identification relied on event\ncharacteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normal\nSNe Ia. The light curve fitter SALT2 was used for this purpose, assigning host\ngalaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events.

Our VLT/FORS2 spectra of 89 member galaxies yield a cluster\nredshift, z=0.870, and velocity dispersion, s=1321+/-106 km/s.

Existing social\nnetwork-based solutions to mitigate the Sybil attacks in DHT routing have a\nhigh state requirement and do not provide an adequate level of privacy. For\ninstance, such techniques require a user to reveal their social network\ncontacts. We design X-Vine, a protection mechanism for distributed hash tables\nthat operates entirely by communicating over social network links. As with\ntraditional peer-to-peer systems, X-Vine provides robustness, scalability, and\na platform for innovation. The use of social network links for communication\nhelps protect participant privacy and adds a new dimension of trust absent from\nprevious designs. X-Vine is resilient to denial of service via Sybil attacks,\nand in fact is the first Sybil defense that requires only a logarithmic amount\nof state per node, making it suitable for large-scale and dynamic settings.\nX-Vine also helps protect the privacy of users social network contacts and\nkeeps their IP addresses hidden from those outside of their social circle,\nproviding a basis for pseudonymous communication. We first evaluate our design\nwith analysis and simulations, using several real world large-scale social\nnetworking topologies. We show that the constraints of X-Vine allow the\ninsertion of only a logarithmic number of Sybil identities per attack edge; we\nshow this mitigates the impact of malicious attacks while not affecting the\nperformance of honest nodes.

Several candidates have been proposed: massive main-sequence stars\n(fast rotating or binaries), intermediate-mass AGB stars, or SNeII. We studied\nred giant branch (RGB) stars in the GC M4 (NGC 6121) to measure their chemical\nsignature. We confirm the presence of a bimodal population, first discovered by\nMarino et al. (2008).

The 8 CLs studied, of Si, S, Fe, Al and Ca elements and\ncorresponding to ionization potentials (IP) in the range 125-450 eV, are\ndetected in 67% (36 AGNs) of the sample. The four most frequent CLs - [SiVI]\n19630\\AA, [SVIII] 9913\\AA, [SIX] 12520\\AA\\ and [SiX] 14320\\AA, - display a\nnarrow range in luminosity, with most lines located in the interval logL 39-40\nerg/s. We found that the non-detection is largely associated with either a lost\nof spatial resolution or increasing object distance. Yet, there are AGNs where\nthe lack of CLs may be genuine and reflect an AGN ionising continuum lacking\nphotons below a few keV. The FWHM of the lines profiles increases with\nincreasing IP up to energies around 300 eV, where a maximum in the FWHM is\nreached. For higher IP lines, the FWHM remains nearly constant or decreases\nwith increasing IP. We ascribe this effect to an increasing density environment\nas we approach to the innermost regions of the AGN, where densities above the\ncritical density of the CLs with IP larger than 300 eV are reached. This sets a\nstrict range limit for the density in the boundary region between the narrow\nand the broad region of 10^8 - 10^9 cm^{-3}. A relationship between the\nluminosity of the coronal lines and that of the soft and hard X-ray emission\nand the soft X-ray photon index is observed: the coronal emission becomes\nstronger with both increasing x-ray emission (soft and hard) and steeper X-ray\nphoton index. Thus, photoionization appears as the dominant excitation\nmechanism. These trends hold when considering Type 1 sources only; they get\nweaker or vanish when including Type 2 sources, very likely because the X-ray\nemission measured in the later is not the intrinsic ionising continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 19:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This virial state is a consequence of the low gas fractions within\nthe subclusters, caused by the accretion of gas onto the stars and the\naccretion-induced shrinkage of the subclusters. Because the subclusters are\ngas-poor, up to a length scale of 0.1-0.2 pc at the end of the simulation, they\nare only weakly affected by gas expulsion. The fraction of subclusters that\nreaches the high density required to evolve to a gas-poor state increases with\nthe density of the star-forming region.

As the most distant GRBs and\nstar-forming galaxies probe the reionization epoch, the potential rewards of\nunderstanding the redshift-dependent ratio Psi(z) of the GRB rate to star\nformation rate are significant and include addressing fundamental questions\nsuch as incompleteness in rest-frame UV surveys for determining the star\nformation rate at high redshift and time variations in the stellar initial mass\nfunction. Using an extensive sample of 112 GRBs above a fixed luminosity limit\ndrawn from the Second Swift Burst Alert Telescope catalog, we compare the\ncumulative redshift distribution N(< z) of GRBs with the star formation density\nrho_sfr(z) measured from UV-selected galaxies over 0 < z < 4.

These may either connect freely falling \"satellites,\" or wrap\nnon-trivial cycles of geometries like the torus, and are also used in\ndiffeomorphism- invariant constructions of two-point functions of field\noperators.

We obtain a\nsingle homogeneous spectroscopic redshift sample, totalizing about 11000\ngalaxies.

We find a constant and\nflat faint-end slope alpha in the FUV LF at z<1.7. At z>1.7, we set alpha\nsteepening with (1+z). The absolute magnitude M*_FUV brightens in the entire\nrange 0<z<4.5, and at z>2 it is on average brighter than in the literature,\nwhile phi* is smaller. Our total LD shows a peak at z=2, present also when\nconsidering all sources of uncertainty. The SFRD history peaks as well at z=2.\nIt rises by a factor of 6 during 2 Gyr (from z=4.5 to z=2), and then decreases\nby a factor of 12 during 10 Gyr down to z=0.05. This peak is mainly produced by\na similar peak within the population of galaxies with -21.5<=M_FUV<=-19.5 mag.\nAs times goes by, the total SFRD is dominated by fainter and fainter galaxies.\nThe presence of a clear peak at z=2 and a fast rise at z>2 of the SFRD is\ncompelling for models of galaxy formation. The mean dust attenuation A_FUV of\nthe global galaxy population rises by 1 mag during 2 Gyr from z=4.5 to z=2,\nreaches its maximum at z=1 (A_FUV=2.2 mag), and then decreases by 1.1 mag\nduring 7 Gyr down to z=0.

The model was developed to account for data\non external galaxies with sensitive HI data. For appropriate parameter values,\nthe model reproduces well the HI emission observed at Intermediate Velocities.\nThe optimal parameters imply that cool gas is ionised as it is blasted out of\nthe disc, but becomes neutral when its vertical velocity has been reduced by\n~30 per cent. The parameters also imply that cooling of coronal gas in the\nwakes of fountain clouds transfers gas from the virial-temperature corona to\nthe disc at ~2 Mo/yr. This rate agrees, to within the uncertainties with the\naccretion rate required to sustain the Galaxy's star formation without\ndepleting the supply of interstellar gas.

Moreover, attackers may not\nfollow the fusion center's decision regarding their spectrum access. This paper\nconsiders a challenging attack scenario where multiple rational attackers\noverhear all honest SUs' sensing reports and cooperatively maximize attackers'\naggregate spectrum utilization. We show that, without attack-prevention\nmechanisms, honest SUs are unable to transmit over the licensed spectrum, and\nthey may further be penalized by the primary user for collisions due to\nattackers' aggressive transmissions. To prevent such attacks, we propose two\nnovel attack-prevention mechanisms with direct and indirect punishments. The\nkey idea is to identify collisions to the primary user that should not happen\nif all SUs follow the fusion center's decision. Unlike prior work, the proposed\nsimple mechanisms do not require the fusion center to identify and exclude\nattackers. The direct punishment can effectively prevent all attackers from\nbehaving maliciously.

This approximation ratio is the best possible even\nfor non-truthful algorithms, assuming $P \\neq NP$. Given the recent sequence of\nnegative results for combinatorial auctions under more restrictive notions of\nincentive compatibility, this development raises a natural question: Are\ntruthful-in-expectation mechanisms compatible with polynomial-time\napproximation in a way that deterministic or universally truthful mechanisms\nare not? In particular, can polynomial-time truthful-in-expectation mechanisms\nguarantee a near-optimal approximation ratio for more general variants of\ncombinatorial auctions?\n  We prove that this is not the case.

One of\nthe most popular retrieval services is to find a set of papers similar to the\npaper under consideration, which requires a measure that computes similarities\nbetween papers. Scientific literature databases exhibit two interesting\ncharacteristics that are different from general databases. First, the papers\ncited by old papers are often not included in the database due to technical and\neconomic reasons. Second, since a paper references the papers published before\nit, few papers cite recently-published papers. These two characteristics cause\nall existing similarity measures to fail in at least one of the following\ncases: (1) measuring the similarity between old, but similar papers, (2)\nmeasuring the similarity between recent, but similar papers, and (3) measuring\nthe similarity between two similar papers: one old, the other recent.

The LSFE is estimated from the main-sequence turn\noff point in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of a region. Extinction\ncorrected turn off magnitude is converted to age, which represents the LSFE in\na region. The spatial map of the LSFE age shows that the star formation has\nshrunk to the central regions in the last 100Myr in both the galaxies. The\nlocation and age of LSFE is found to correlate well with those of the star\ncluster in both the Clouds. The SMC map shows two separate concentrations of\nyoung star formation.

Obtained\nresults show that despite magnetic clouds have lower occurrence rate and lower\nefficiency than CIR and Sheath they play an essential role in generation of\nmagnetic storms due to higher geoeffectiveness of storm generation (i.e higher\nprobability to contain large and long-term southward IMF Bz component).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 06:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-18"}

The Cas A observation shows that the\ncentral source is a compact star that has high effective temperature, and it is\nconsistent with the cooling without exotic phases. The observation also gives\nthe mass range of $M \\geqslant 1.5 M_\\odot$, which may conflict with the\ncurrent plausible cooling scenario of compact stars. There are some cooled\ncompact stars such as Vela or 3C58, which can be barely explained by the\nminimal cooling scenario, which includes the neutrino emission by nucleon\nsuperfluidity (PBF). Therefore, we invoke the exotic cooling processes, where a\nheavier star cools faster than lighter one. However, the scenario seems to be\ninconsistent with the observation of Cas A. Therefore, we present a new cooling\nscenario to explain the observation of Cas A by constructing models that\ninclude a quark color superconducting (CSC) phase with a large energy gap; this\nphase appears at ultrahigh density region and reduces neutrino emissivity. In\nour model, a compact star has CSC quark core with a low neutrino emissivity\nsurrounded by high emissivity region made by normal quarks. We present cooling\ncurves obtained from the evolutionary calculations of compact stars: while\nheavier stars cool slowly, and lighter ones indicate the opposite tendency\nwithout considering nucleon superfluidity.

These phenomena (such as the Struve--Sahade effect,\ndifficulties to determine properly the spectral type,...) have been reported\nand documented in the literature. Aims: We simulate the spectra of circular\nmassive binaries at different phases of the orbital cycle and accounting for\nthe gravitational influence of the companion star on the shape and physical\nproperties of the stellar surface. Methods: We use the Roche potential to\ncompute the stellar surface, von Zeipel theorem and reflection effects to\ncompute the surface temperature. We then interpolate in a grid of NLTE\nplan-parallel atmosphere model spectra to obtain the local spectrum at each\nsurface point. We finally sum all the contributions (accounting for the Doppler\nshift, limb-darkening, ...) to obtain the total spectrum. The computation is\ndone for different orbital phases and for different sets of physical and\norbital parameters. Results: Our first models reproduce the Struve--Sahade\neffect for several lines. Another effect, surface temperature distribution is\nvisible but the distribution predicted by our current model is not yet\nconsistent with observations. Conclusions: In some cases, the Struve--Sahade\neffect as well as more complex line intensity variations could be linked to\nblends of intrinsically asymmetric line profiles that are not appropriatly\ntreated by the deblending routine. Systematic variations of lines for (nearly)\ncontact systems are also predicted by the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 07:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Its eccentricity distribution\nevolves mostly due to the Yarkovsky/YORP effect and assuming that: (i) impact\ndisruption was isotropic, and (ii) albedo distribution of small asteroids is\nthe same as for large ones, we can estimate the age of the Hilda family to be\n$4_{-1}^{+0}\\,{\\rm Gyr}$. We also calculate collisional activity in the J3/2\nregion. Our results indicate that current collisional rates are very low for a\n200\\,km parent body such that the number of expected events over Gyrs is much\nsmaller than one.\n  The large age and the low probability of the collisional disruption lead us\nto the conclusion that the Hilda family might have been created during the Late\nHeavy Bombardment when the collisions were much more frequent. The Hilda family\nmay thus serve as a test of orbital behavior of planets during the LHB. We\ntested the influence of the giant-planet migration on the distribution of the\nfamily members. The scenarios that are consistent with the observed Hilda\nfamily are those with fast migration time scales $\\simeq 0.3\\,{\\rm Myr}$ to\n$3\\,{\\rm Myr}$, because longer time scales produce a family that is depleted\nand too much spread in eccentricity. Moreover, there is an indication that\nJupiter and Saturn were no longer in a compact configuration (with period ratio\n$P_{\\rm S}/P_{\\rm J} > 2.09$) at the time when the Hilda family was created.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 08:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-07"}

A model\natmosphere analysis of the metal absorption lines detected in the blue part of\nthe optical spectrum, along with the GALEX near-ultraviolet flux, yields a\nwhite dwarf temperature of 6000 +/- 200 K and a metallicity value of log(Z/H)=\n-2.0 +/- 0.3. The sodium absorption doublet is used to measure the radial\nvelocity of the secondary star, K2 ~ 252 km/s and iron absorption lines in the\nblue part of the spectrum provide the radial velocity of the white dwarf, K1 ~\n95 km/s, yielding a mass ratio of q ~ 0.38. Light curve model fitting, using\nthe Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, gives the inclination angle as i =\n(79.05 - 79.36) +/- 0.15 degrees, and the stellar masses as M1 = 0.415 +/-\n0.010 solar-masses and M2 = 0.158 +/- 0.006 solar-masses. Systematic\nuncertainties in the absolute calibration of the photometric data influence the\ndetermination of the stellar radii. The radius of the white dwarf is found to\nbe R1 = (0.0157 - 0.0161) +/- 0.0003 solar-radii and the volume-averaged radius\nof the tidally distorted secondary is R2 = (0.197 - 0.203) +/- 0.003\nsolar-radii. The white dwarf in J1210+3347 is a very strong He-core candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 13:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

An interactive web-based interface allows users to freely download\nthe full (from H to Bi) isotopic composition, as it changes after each third\ndredge-up episode and the stellar yields the models produce. A first set of AGB\nmodels, having masses in the range 1.5 < M/Msun < 3.0 and metallicities 1e-3 <\nZ < 2e-2, is discussed here. For each model, a detailed description of the\nphysical and the chemical evolution is provided.

The resulting\nnucleosynthesis scenario is checked by comparing the theoretical [hs/ls] and\n[Pb/hs] ratios to those obtained from the available abundance analysis of\ns-enhanced stars. On the average, the variation with the metallicity of these\nspectroscopic indexes is well reproduced by theoretical models, although the\npredicted spread at a given metallicity is substantially smaller than the\nobserved one. Possible explanations for such a difference are briefly\ndiscussed. An independent check of the third dredge-up efficiency is provided\nby the C-stars luminosity function.

In terms of\nthese variables, the field equations and basic physical and geometric\nquantities are formally identical to their corresponding expressions in the\nspherically symmetric LTB dust models. Since we can map every Szekeres model to\na unique LTB model, rigorous results valid for the latter models can be readily\ngeneralized to a non-spherical Szekeres geometry. The new variables lead\nnaturally to an initial value formulation in which all scalars are expressed as\nscaling laws in terms of their values at an arbitrary initial space slice.\nThese variables also yield a significant simplification of numerical work,\nsince the fluid flow evolution equations become a system of autonomous ordinary\ndifferential equations subjected to algebraic constraints containing the\ninformation on the deviations from spherical symmetry.

The analysis of its oscillation spectrum yielded precise estimates of\nthe mode frequencies over nine radial orders and pointed out some unusual\ncharacteristics: there exist some modes outside the identified ridges in the\nechelle diagram and the curvature of the l=1 ridge significantly differs from\nthat of the l=0 ridge. We here propose a toy-model to describe avoided\ncrossings with a strong coupling between the p-mode and g-mode cavities and we\nshow that the peculiar features of the oscillation spectrum of HD49385 can be\naccounted for only by a low-frequency l=1 avoided crossing. This leads us to\nestablish the post-main-sequence status of HD49385. We then investigate the\ninformation which is brought by the mixed modes about the structure of the\ncore. Having shown that traditional optimization techniques are ill-suited for\nstars with mixed modes in avoided crossing, we propose a new approach to the\ncomputation of grids of models, which we apply to HD49385. As a result, we show\nthat the amount of core overshooting in HD49385 is either very low\n(0<alpha_ov<0.05) or moderate (0.18<alpha_ov<0.20). The mixing length parameter\nis found to be significantly lower than the solar one (alpha_CGM=0.55\\pm0.04\ncompared to the solar calibrated value alpha_sun=0.64). We also find that the\nrevised solar abundances of Asplund give a better agreement than the classical\nones of Grevesse & Noels. Finally, we show that the strength of the coupling\nbetween the cavities, which can be estimated through the properties of the\nobserved avoided crossing, plays a dominant role in constraining the parameters\nof the models. At each step, we investigate the origin and meaning of our\nseismic diagnostics in terms of the physical structure of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 14:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This is the visible\nmanifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solar\nconvection zone. Because red giants have deeper convection zones and more\nextended atmospheres than the Sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulation\nin red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. Until now, neither\nobservations nor 1D analytical convection models could put constraints on\ngranulation in red giants. However, thanks to asteroseismology, this study can\nnow be performed. The resulting parameters yield physical information about the\ngranulation. We analyze \\sim1000 red giants that have been observed by Kepler\nduring 13 months. We fit the power spectra with Harvey-like profiles to\nretrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and power\nP_gran). We also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into account\nthat different slopes are used in the Harvey functions. We search for a\ncorrelation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter\n(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters\n(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (T_eff)). We\nshow that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and P_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistent\nwith the theoretical predictions. We find that the granulation time scales of\nstars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales of\nstars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. Finally, we show\nthat realistic 3D simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the\n(T_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the Kepler observations\nwell in terms of trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 14:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

From I,\nI-Z color-magnitude diagrams we have selected 153 candidates that fit the\npreviously known sequence of the cluster. Using J-band photometry, we find that\n124 of the 151 candidates follow the previously known infrared photometric\nsequence of the cluster and are probably members. We have studied the spatial\ndistribution of these candidates and found that there are objects located at\ndistances greater than 30 arcmin to the north and west of Sigma Orionis that\nprobably belong to different populations of the Orion's Belt. For the 102 bona\nfide Sigma Orionis cluster member candidates, we find that the radial surface\ndensity can be represented by a decreasing exponential function (sigma =\nsigma_0 e^{-r/r_0}) with a central density of sigma_0=0.23+/-0.03\nobject/arcmin^{2} and a characteristic radius of r_0=9.5+/-0.7 arcmin. From a\nstatistical comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that the\nspatial distribution of the cluster member candidates is compatible with a\nPoissonian distribution and, hence, they are not mainly forming aggregations or\nsub-clustering. Using near-infrared JHK-band data from 2MASS and UKIDSS and\nmid-infrared data from IRAC/Spitzer, we find that 5-9 % of the brown dwarf\ncandidates in the Sigma Orionis cluster have K-band excesses and 31+/-7 % of\nthem show mid-infrared excesses at wavelengths longer than 5.8 microns, which\nare probably related to the presence of disks. We have also calculated the\ninitial mass spectrum (dN/dm) of Sigma Orionis from very low mass stars (0.10\nMsol) to the deuterium-burning mass limit (0.012-0.013 Msol). This is a rising\nfunction toward lower masses and can be represented by a power-law distribution\n(dN/dm = m^{-alpha}) with an exponent alpha of 0.7+/-0.3 for an age of 3 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 15:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Its precise conceptual-mathematical formulation as \"modular localization\"\nwithin the setting of local operator algebras also suggests novel ways of\nlooking at general (non-integrable) QFTs which are not based on quantizing\nclassical field theories. Conformal QFT, which is known to admit no particle\ninterpretation, suggest the presence of a \"partial\" integrability, referred to\nas \"conformal integrability\".

For chiral conformal models this reduces to the braid\ngroup as it is represented in Hecke- or Birman-Wenzl- algebras associated to\nchiral models.

Networks with heterogeneous degree distributions are shown\nto be more resilient to contagion triggered by the failure of a random bank,\nbut more fragile with respect to contagion triggered by the failure of highly\nconnected nodes. A power law distribution of balance sheet size is shown to\ninduce an inefficient diversification that makes the system more prone to\ncontagion events. A targeted policy aimed at reinforcing the stability of the\nbiggest banks is shown to improve the stability of the system in the regime of\nhigh average degree.

We put a number of\nobservational and physical constraints on AGN obscuring torii resulting from\nsuch fragmentation cascades. We find that torii fed by fragmenting asteroids\ndisappear at both low and high AGN luminosities. At high luminosities, $L \\sim\nL_{\\rm Edd}$, where $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington limit, the AGN radiation\npressure blows out the microscopic dust too rapidly. At low luminosities, on\nthe other hand, the AGN discs may avoid gravitational fragmentation into stars\nand solids.
