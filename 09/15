Conventional Shannon's information measure evaluates a\nsequence of the process' static events for each information state and do not\nreveal hidden dynamic connections between these events. The paper formulates\nthe mathematical forms of the information regularities, based on a minimax\nvariation principle (VP) for IPF, applied to the evolution's both random\nmicroprocesses and dynamic macroprocesses. The paper shows that the VP single\nform of the mathematical law leads to the following evolutionary regularities:\n-creation of the order from stochastics through the evolutionary macrodynamics,\ndescribed by a gradient of dynamic potential, evolutionary speed and the\nevolutionary conditions of a fitness and diversity; -the evolutionary hierarchy\nwith growing information values and potential adaptation; -the adaptive\nself-controls and a self-organization with a mechanism of copying to a genetic\ncode. This law and the regularities determine unified functional informational\nmechanisms of evolution dynamics. By introducing both objective and subjective\ninformation observers, we consider the observers' information acquisition,\ninteractive cognitive evolution dynamics, and neurodynamics, based on the\nEF-IPF approach.

Such diagnoses are of great interest in\natmospheric and ocean circulation sciences, as well in surface and subsurface\nhydrology. The temporal evolution of groundwater age and its frequency\ndistributions can display important changes as flow regimes vary due to natural\nchange in climate and hydrologic conditions and/or human induced pressures on\nthe resource to satisfy the water demand. Steady-state age frequency\ndistributions can be modelled using standard numerical techniques, since the\ngeneral balance equation describing age transport under steady-state flow\nconditions is exactly equivalent to a standard advection-dispersion equation.\nThe time-dependent problem is however described by an extended transport\noperator that incorporates an additional coordinate for water age.

We\nbegin our simulation at z=100 and trace the evolution of gas and dark matter\nuntil the formation of the first minihalo. We then follow the collapse of the\ngas within the minihalo up to densities of n = 10^12 cm^-3, at which point we\nreplace the high-density particles with a sink particle to represent the\ngrowing protostar. We model the effect of Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation emitted\nby the protostar, and employ a ray-tracing scheme to follow the growth of the\nsurrounding H II region over the next 5000 yr. We find that a disk assembles\naround the first protostar, and that radiative feedback will not prevent\nfurther fragmentation of the disk to form multiple Pop III stars. Ionization of\nneutral hydrogen and photodissociation of H_2 by LW radiation leads to heating\nof the dense gas to several thousand Kelvin, and this warm region expands\noutward at the gas sound speed. Once the extent of this warm region becomes\nequivalent to the size of the disk, the disk mass declines while the accretion\nrate onto the protostars is reduced by an order of magnitude. This occurs when\nthe largest sink has grown to ~ 20 M_sol while the second sink has grown to 7\nM_sol, and we estimate the main sink will approach an asymptotic value of ~ 30\nM_sol by the time it reaches the main sequence. Our simulation thus indicates\nthat the most likely outcome is a massive Pop III binary. However, we simulate\nonly one minihalo, and the statistical variation between minihaloes may be\nsubstantial.

Computation\nof various magnetic parameters such as magnetic energy, gradient of twist of\nsunspot fields and any kind of extrapolations, heavily hinge on the force-free\napproximation of the photospheric sunspot magnetic fields. Thus it is important\nto inspect the force-freeness of sunspot fields. The force-freeness of sunspot\nmagnetic fields has been examined earlier by some researchers ending with\nincoherent results. Accurate photospheric vector field measurements with high\nspatial resolution are required to inspect the force-free nature of sunspots.\nWe use several such vector magnetograms obtained from the Solar Optical\nTelescope/Spectro-Polarimeter aboard the Hinode. Both necessary and sufficient\nconditions for force-freeness are examined by checking global and local nature\nof magnetic forces over sunspots. We find that the sunspot magnetic fields are\nnot much away from force-free configuration, although they are not completely\nforce-free on the photosphere. The umbral and inner penumbral fields are more\nforce-free than the middle and the outer penumbral fields. During their\nevolution, sunspot magnetic fields are found to maintain their proximity to\nforce-free behaviour. Although a dependence of net Lorentz force components is\nseen on the evolutionary stages of the sunspots, we don't find a systematic\nrelationship between the nature of sunspot fields and associated flare\nactivity. Further, we examine whether the fields at photosphere follow linear\nor non-linear force free conditions. After examining this in various complex\nand simple sunspots we conclude that,in either case,the photospheric sunspot\nfields are closer to satisfy non linear force-free field approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 18:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Although the shape of the simulated\nhalo varies with radius, frequency maps of local samples of halo orbits\nconfined to the inner halo contain most of the information about the global\nshape of the halo and its major orbit families. Quiescent or adiabatic disk\nformation results in significant trapping of halo orbits in resonant orbit\nfamilies (i.e. orbits with commensurable frequencies). If a good estimate of\nthe Galactic potential in the inner halo (within ~50kpc) is available, the\nappearance of strong, stable resonances in frequency maps of halo orbits will\nallow us to determine the degree of resonant trapping induced by the disk\npotential.

To reproduce the size of the Tevatron\nasymmetry, the couplings of the $Z^\\prime$ to standard model quarks must be\nlarge, inevitably leading to production of same-sign top quark pairs at the\nTevatron and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We discuss the constraints on\nthis model from (a) the Tevatron $t \\bar{t}$ cross section, (b) the Tevatron $t\n\\bar{t}$ invariant mass distribution, and the limits at the Tevatron on the\nsame sign top quark pair cross section. We explore the discovery potential for\n$tt$ and $ttj$ production in early LHC experiments at 7 TeV and conclude that\nif a $tt$ signal is not observed with 1 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity,\nthen a non-universal $Z^\\prime$ alone cannot explain the Tevatron\nforward-backward asymmetry. Limits on the same sign cross section at the LHC\nfrom the CMS collaboration already disfavor this interpretation of the reported\nasymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 20:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-16"}

Evolution models for the planet suggest a mass of\nheavy elements of the order of 800 ME if embedded in a central core, requiring\na revision either of the planet formation models or of planet evolution and\nstructure models. We note however that smaller amounts of heavy elements are\nexpected from more realistic models in which they are mixed throughout the\nenvelope. The planet orbits a G-type star with an orbital period of 9.24 days\nand an eccentricity of 0.56. The star's projected rotational velocity is vsini\n= 4.5 +/- 1.0 km/s, corresponding to a spin period of 11.5 +/- 3.1 days if its\naxis of rotation is perpendicular to the orbital plane. In the framework of\nDarwinian theories and neglecting stellar magnetic breaking, we calculate the\ntidal evolution of the system and show that CoRoT-20b is presently one of the\nvery few Darwin-stable planets that is evolving towards a triple synchronous\nstate with equality of the orbital, planetary and stellar spin periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 20:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-04"}

Following a first account of the experiment [Kandula et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 105, 063001 (2010)], an extensive review is given of the\ndemonstration that the resulting spectrum at 51 nm is fully phase coherent and\ncan be applied to precision metrology. The pulses are used in a scheme of\ndirect-frequency-comb excitation of helium atoms from the ground state to the\n1s4p and 1s5p 1P_1 states. Laser ionization by auxiliary 1064 nm pulses is used\nto detect the excited state population, resulting in a cosine-like signal as a\nfunction of the repetition rate of the frequency comb with a modulation\ncontrast of up to 55%. Analysis of the visibility of this comb structure yields\nan estimated timing jitter between the two upconverted comb laser pulses of 50\nattoseconds, whch indicates that extension to even shorter wavelengths should\nbe feasible. The helium metrology investigation results in transition\nfrequencies of 5740806993(10) MHz and 5814248672(6) MHz for excitation of the\n1s4p and 1s5p 1P_1 states, respectively.

The relic with a circular morphology at the\noutskirts of the cluster A1664 has an integrated spectral index of -1.10+/-0.06\nand is best fit by the model of radio lobes lurking for ~ 4x10^7 yr. The relic\nnear A786 has a curved spectrum and is best fit by a model of radio lobes\nlurking for ~ 3x10^7 yr. At 4.7 GHz, a compact radio source, possibly the\nprogenitor of the A786 relic, is detected near the center of the radio relic.\nThe A786 radio relic is thus likely a lurking radio galaxy rather than a site\nof cosmological shock as has been considered in earlier studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 04:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The\nmodel fails to reproduce the large Balmer excesses shown by the four hottest\nstars (T* > 12000 K). We derive Macc propto M*^5 and Lacc propto L*^1.2 for our\nsample, with scatter. Empirical calibrations relating the accretion and the\nHalpha, [OI]6300, and Brgamma luminosities are provided. The slopes in our\nexpressions are slightly shallower than those for lower mass stars, but the\ndifference is within the uncertainties, except for the [OI]6300 line. The\nHalpha 10% width is uncorrelated with Macc, unlike for the lower mass regime.\nThe mean Halpha width shows higher values as the projected rotational\nvelocities of HAe stars increase, which agrees with MA. The accretion rate\nvariations in the sample are typically lower than 0.5 dex on timescales of days\nto months, Our data suggest that the changes in the Balmer excess are\nuncorrelated to the simultaneous changes of the line luminosities.\n  The Balmer excesses and Halpha line widths of HAe stars can be interpreted\nwithin the context of MA, which is not the case for several HBes. The steep\ntrend relating Macc and M* can be explained from the mass-age distribution\ncharacterizing HAeBe stars. The line luminosities used for low-mass objects are\nalso valid to estimate typical accretion rates for the intermediate-mass regime\nunder similar empirical expressions.

In this paper we\npresent IFS data of the low-redshift QSO HE 2158-0107 for which we find strong\nevidence for sub-solar NLR metallicities associated with a massive BH\n(M_BH~3x10^8Msun). The QSO is surrounded by a large extended emission-line\nregion reaching out to 30kpc from the QSO in a tail-like geometry. We present\noptical and near-IR images and investigate the properties of the host galaxy.\nThe SED of the host is rather blue, indicative of a significant young age\nstellar population formed within the last 1Gyr. A 3sigma upper limit of\nL_bulge<4.5x10^10Lsun for the H band luminosity and a corresponding stellar\nmass upper limit of M_bulge<3.4x10^10Msun show that the host is offset from the\nlocal BH-bulge relations. This is independently supported by the kinematics of\nthe gas. Although the stellar mass of the host galaxy is lower than expected,\nit cannot explain the exceptionally low metallicity of the gas. We suggest that\nthe extended emission-line region and the galaxy growth are caused by the\ninfall of nearly pristine gas from the environment of the QSO host. Minor\nmergers of dwarf galaxies or the theoretically predicted smooth accretion of\ncold gas are both potential drivers behind that process. Since the metallicity\nof the gas in the NLR is much lower than expected, we suspect that the external\ngas has already reached the galaxy centre and may even contribute to the\ncurrent feeding of the BH. HE 2158-0107 appears to represent a particular phase\nof substantial BH and galaxy growth that can be observationally linked with the\naccretion of external material from its environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 10:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Flow maps show the movement of objects\nbetween places. They reduce visual clutter by bundling lines smoothly and\navoiding self-intersections. To capture these properties, our angle-restricted\nSteiner arborescences, or flux trees, connect several targets to a source with\na tree of minimal length whose arcs obey a certain restriction on the angle\nthey form with the source.\n  We study the properties of optimal flux trees and show that they are planar\nand consist of logarithmic spirals and straight lines. Flux trees have the\nshallow-light property. We show that computing optimal flux trees is NP-hard.\nHence we consider a variant of flux trees which uses only logarithmic spirals.\nSpiral trees approximate flux trees within a factor depending on the angle\nrestriction. Computing optimal spiral trees remains NP-hard, but we present an\nefficient 2-approximation, which can be extended to avoid \"positive monotone\"\nobstacles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 11:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-16"}

Our two main contributions follow: i) We consider a low-rank\nprobabilistic model of user taste. More specifically, we consider that users\nand items are partitioned in a constant number of classes, such that users and\nitems within the same class are statistically identical. We prove that without\nprior knowledge of the compositions of the classes, based solely on few random\nobserved ratings (namely $O(N\\log N)$ such ratings for $N$ users), we can\npredict user preference with high probability for unrated items by running a\nlocal vote among users with similar profile vectors. In addition, we provide\nempirical evaluations characterising the way in which spectral profiling\nperformance depends on the dimension of the profile space. Such evaluations are\nperformed on a data set of real user ratings provided by Netflix. ii) We\ndevelop distributed algorithms which provably achieve an embedding of users\ninto a low-dimensional space, based on spectral transformation.

(2010) showed that the rings could have been initially\nmassive, and so was the ring's progenitor itself. One may wonder if the\nmid-sized moons may have formed also from the debris of a massive ring\nprogenitor, as also suggested in Canup (2010). However, the process driving\nmid-sized moons accretion from the icy debris disks has not been investigated\nin details. In particular, this process does not seem able to explain the\nvarying silicate contents of the mid-sized moons (from 6% to 57% in mass).\nHere, we explore the formation of large objects from a massive ice-rich ring (a\nfew times Rhea's mass) and describe the fundamental properties and implications\nof this new process. Using a hybrid computer model, we show that accretion\nwithin massive icy rings can form all mid-sized moons from Mimas to Rhea.\nHowever in order to explain their current locations, intense dissipation within\nSaturn (with Qp<2000) would be required. Our results are consistent with a\nsatellite origin tied to the rings formation at least 2.5 Gy ago, both\ncompatible with either a formation concurrent to Saturn or during the Late\nHeavy Bombardment. Tidal heating related to high-eccentricity post-accretional\nepisodes may induce early geological activity. If some massive irregular chunks\nof silicates were initially present within the rings, they would be present\ntoday inside the satellites' cores which would have accreted icy shells while\nbeing tidally expelled from the rings (via a heterogeneous accretion\nprocess)while those still present in the rings are interpreted as today\nSaturn's rings' propellers and ring-moons (like Pan or Daphnis).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 14:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The new ingredient,\ncompared to scalars, involves a `generalized' basis of coherent states which\nlabels a particular half of the fermion components as coordinates or momenta,\ndepending on the choice of quantization (standard or alternative).

In the case of the extremal black hole,\nthe RG flows connect two fixed points at the UV AdS boundary to two fixed\npoints at the IR AdS_2 region. The double trace flow is shown, both numerically\nand analytically, to develop a pole singularity in the AdS_2 region at low\nfrequency and near the Fermi momentum, which can be traced to the appearance of\nmassless fermion modes on the low energy cut-off surface.

Structural analysis by\nhigh resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals the presence of a\nlateral AlGaN shell due to a composition dependent lateral growth rate of the\nbarrier material. The structural properties are used as input parameters for\nthree dimensional numerical simulations of the confinement which show that the\npresence of the AlGaN shell has to be considered to explain the observed\ndependence of the emission energy on the Al concentration in the barrier. The\nsimulations reveal that the maximum in the emission energy for x ~ 30% is\nassigned to the smallest lateral strain gradient and consequently the lowest\nradial internal electric fields in the nanodiscs. Higher Al-concentrations in\nthe barrier cause high radial electric fields that can overcome the exciton\nbinding energy and result in substantially reduced emission intensities.\nEffects of polarization-induced axial internal electric fields on the\nphotoluminescence characteristics have been investigated using nanowire samples\nwith nanodisc heights ranging between 1.2 nm and 3.5 nm at different Al\nconcentrations. The influence of the quantum confined Stark effect is\nsignificantly reduced compared to GaN/AlGaN quantum well structures which is\nattributed to the formation of misfit dislocations at the heterointerfaces\nwhich weakens the internal electric polarization fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 15:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-16"}

We\nanalytically calculate the current response function and surface impedance for\na sample with spatially uniform distribution of impurities, treating magnetic\nimpurities in the framework of the Shiba theory. The obtained general\nexpressions hold in a wide range of parameter values, such as temperature,\nfrequency, mean free path, and exchange coupling strength. This generality, on\nthe one hand, allows for direct numerical implementation of our results to\ndescribe experimental systems (SRF cavities, superconducting qubits) under\nvarious practically relevant conditions. On the other hand, explicit analytical\nexpressions can be obtained in a number of limiting cases, which makes possible\nfurther theoretical investigation of certain regimes. As a feature of key\nrelevance to SRF cavities, we show that in the regime of \"gapless\nsuperconductivity\" the surface resistance exhibits saturation at zero\ntemperature. Our theory thus explicitly demonstrates that magnetic impurities,\npresumably contained in the oxide surface layer of the SRF cavities, provide a\nmicroscopic mechanism for the residual resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 15:57:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 19:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-16"}
