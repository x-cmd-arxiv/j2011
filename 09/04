In order to effectively remove low redshift interlopers,\ndeep optical imaging is needed, at least 1 mag deeper than the bands in which\nthe objects are detected. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that strong\nnebular lines can lead to an overestimation of the mass and the age of galaxies\nderived from fitting of their SED. Without removing emission lines, the age and\nthe stellar mass estimates are overestimated by a factor of 2 on average and up\nto a factor of 10 for the high-EW galaxies.

Our analysis,\nwhich builds on Kirkwood's solution using spherical harmonics, clarifies\nimportant aspects of the approximation and its relationship to Generalized Born\nmodels. First, our results suggest a new perspective for analyzing fast\nelectrostatic models: the separation of variables between material properties\n(the dielectric constants) and geometry (the solute dielectric boundary and\ncharge distribution). Second, we find that the eigenfunctions of the\nreaction-potential operator are exactly preserved in the BIBEE model for the\nsphere, which supports the use of this approximation for analyzing\ncharge-charge interactions in molecular binding. Third, a comparison of BIBEE\nto the recent GB$\\epsilon$ theory suggests a modified BIBEE model capable of\npredicting electrostatic solvation free energies to within 4% of a full\nnumerical Poisson calculation. This modified model leads to a\nprojection-framework understanding of BIBEE and suggests opportunities for\nfuture improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2011 20:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In previous studies, only\nthe magnetic field generation from the initially-adiabatic fluctuations has\nbeen considered. Here we investigate the generation of cosmological magnetic\nfields sourced by the primordial non-adiabatic fluctuations based on the\ncosmological perturbation theory, using the tight-coupling approximations\nbetween photon and baryon fluids. It is found that the magnetic fields from the\nnon-adiabatic fluctuations can arise at the first-order expansion of the tight\ncoupling approximation. This result is in contrast to the case of adiabatic\ninitial fluctuations, where the magnetic fields can be generated only at the\nsecond-order. In a general case where the primordial density perturbations\ncontain small non-adiabatic fluctuations on the top of the dominant adiabatic\nones, we show that the leading source of magnetic fields is given by the\nsecond-order coupling of the adiabatic and non-adiabatic fluctuations. We\ncalculate the power spectrum of the generated magnetic fields when the\nnon-adiabatic fluctuations have a blue power spectrum, which has been suggested\nby recent cosmological observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2011 10:26:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 11:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Fixing the self-force problem amounts to the construction of a\n\\emph{new} theory, which is free of the above pathologies and yet \"sufficiently\nclose\" to the immensely successful original. In a recent paper by the present\nauthor such a proposal, dubbed extended charge dynamics (ECD), was presented.\nThe essential ingredients of classical electrodynamics preserved by ECD (and,\namong the plethora of solutions to the problem, only by ECD) are:\n  - Ontology. The electromagnetic field is the same unquantized classical\nfield, while charges are sufficiently localized conserved currents, accounting\nfor the manifest corpuscular nature of elementary charges.\n  - Symmetries. ECD enjoys the full symmetry group of classical\nelectrodynamics, most importantly the hidden symmetry of scale covariance.\n  - Conservation laws. All ECD conservation laws formally coincide with their\nclassical counterparts, and yet lead to finite conserved quantities.\n  Despite this seemingly classical setting, and the reduction of ECD to\nclassical electrodynamics in the latter's domain of validity, it is shown in\nthe present paper that ensembles of ECD solutions could, in principle,\nreproduce the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics.
