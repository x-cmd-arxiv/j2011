This thesis looks at ways of combating such\ninterference.\n  In Chapters 1 and 2, we outline the necessary information and communication\ntheory background, including the concept of capacity. We also include an\noverview of a new set of schemes for dealing with interference known as\ninterference alignment, paying special attention to a channel-state-based\nstrategy called ergodic interference alignment.\n  In Chapter 3, we consider the operation of large regular and random networks\nby treating interference as background noise. We consider the local performance\nof a single node, and the global performance of a very large network.\n  In Chapter 4, we use ergodic interference alignment to derive the asymptotic\nsum-capacity of large random dense networks. These networks are derived from a\nphysical model of node placement where signal strength decays over the distance\nbetween transmitters and receivers. (See also arXiv:1002.0235 and\narXiv:0907.5165.)\n  In Chapter 5, we look at methods of reducing the long time delays incurred by\nergodic interference alignment. We analyse the tradeoff between reducing delay\nand lowering the communication rate.

The photospheric spectrum is often veiled by an excess continuous\nemission. This veiling is usually attributed to radiation from a heated region\nbeneath the accretion shock. The aim of this research is to clarify the nature\nof the veiling, and whether the narrow chromospheric lines of Fe I and other\nmetals represent a standard chromosphere of a late-type star, or are induced by\nmass accretion. From high-resolution spectroscopy of DR Tauri we found that the\namount of veiling in this star varies from practically nothing to factors more\nthan 10 times the stellar continuum intensity, and that the veiling is caused\nby both a non-photospheric continuum and chromospheric line emission filling in\nthe photospheric absorption lines. This effect can be shown to exist in several\nother T Tauri stars. We conclude that enhanced chromospheric emission in cTTS\nis linked not only to solar-like magnetic activity, but is powered to a greater\nextent by the accreting gas. We suggest that the area of enhanced chromospheric\nemission is induced by mass accretion, which modifies the local structure of\nstellar atmosphere in an area that is more extended than the hot accretion\nspot. The narrow emission lines from this extended area are responsible for the\nextra component in the veiling through line-filling of photospheric absorption\nlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 18:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

One of the major goals of the first generation of low\nfrequency radio telescopes is to measure the 3D 21-cm power spectrum. However,\nthe 21-cm signal could evolve substantially along the line of sight (LOS)\ndirection of an observed 3D volume, since the received signal from different\nplanes transverse to the LOS originated from different look-back times and\ncould therefore be statistically different. Using numerical simulations we\ninvestigate this so-called light cone effect on the spherically averaged 3D\n21-cm power spectrum. For this version of the power spectrum, we find that the\neffect mostly `averages out' and observe a smaller change in the power spectrum\ncompared to the amount of evolution in the mean 21-cm signal and its rms\nvariations along the LOS direction. Nevertheless, changes up to 50% at large\nscales are possible. In general the power is enhanced/suppressed at large/small\nscales when the effect is included. The cross-over mode below/above which the\npower is enhanced/suppressed moves toward larger scales as reionization\nproceeds.

We estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity AGN\nactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interaction\nthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible for\nfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 20:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Our studies\nsuggest this notoriously difficult task may be frustrated by the intuitively\nrealist perspectives of introductory students, and a lack of ontological\nflexibility in their conceptions of light and matter. We have developed a\nframework for understanding and characterizing student perspectives on the\nphysical interpretation of quantum mechanics, and demonstrate the differential\nimpact on student thinking of the myriad ways instructors approach interpretive\nthemes in their introductory courses. Like expert physicists, students\ninterpret quantum phenomena differently, and these interpretations are\nsignificantly influenced by their overall stances on questions central to the\nso-called measurement problem: Is the wave function physically real, or simply\na mathematical tool? Is the collapse of the wave function an ad hoc rule, or a\nphysical transition not described by any equation? Does an electron, being a\nform of matter, exist as a localized particle at all times? These questions,\nwhich are of personal and academic interest to our students, are largely only\nsuperficially addressed in our introductory courses, often for fear of opening\na Pandora's Box of student questions, none of which have easy answers. We show\nhow a transformed modern physics curriculum (recently implemented at the\nUniversity of Colorado) may positively impact student perspectives on\nindeterminacy and wave-particle duality, by making questions of classical and\nquantum reality a central theme of our course, but also by making the beliefs\nof our students, and not just those of scientists, an explicit topic of\ndiscussion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 20:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-08"}

Such lesions are associated with\narticular cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis. The typical injury\nresponse often causes collateral damage, primarily an effect of inflammation,\nwhich results in the spread of lesions beyond the region where the initial\ninjury occurs. We present a minimal mathematical model based on known\nmechanisms to investigate the spread and abatement of such lesions. In\nparticular we represent the \"balancing act\" between pro-inflammatory and\nanti-inflammatory cytokines that is hypothesized to be a principal mechanism in\nthe expansion properties of cartilage damage during the typical injury\nresponse. We present preliminary results of in vitro studies that confirm the\nanti-inflammatory activities of the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO). We assume\nthat the diffusion of cytokines determine the spatial behaviour of injury\nresponse and lesion expansion so that a reaction-diffusion system involving\nchemical species and chondrocyte cell state population densities is a natural\nway to represent cartilage injury response. We present computational results\nusing the mathematical model showing that our representation is successful in\ncapturing much of the interesting spatial behaviour of injury associated lesion\ndevelopment and abatement in articular cartilage. Further, we discuss the use\nof this model to study the possibility of using EPO as a therapy for reducing\nthe amount of inflammation induced collateral damage to cartilage during the\ntypical injury response. The mathematical model presented herein suggests that\nnot only are anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as EPO necessary to prevent\nchondrocytes signaled by pro-inflammatory cytokines from entering apoptosis,\nthey may also influence how chondrocytes respond to signaling by\npro-inflammatory cytokines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 20:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-08"}

Recent discoveries of intensity correlated downflows in the interior\nof a sunspot penumbra provide direct evidence for overturning convection,\nadding to earlier strong indications of convection from filament dynamics\nobserved far from solar disk center, and supporting recent simulations of\nsunspots.\n  Aims. Using spectropolarimetric observations obtained at a spatial resolution\napproaching 0'.'1 with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and its\nspectropolarimeter CRISP, we investigate whether the convective downflows\nrecently discovered in the C i line at 538.03 nm can also be detected in the\nwings of the Fe i line at 630.15 nm\n  Methods. We make azimuthal fits of the measured LOS velocities in the core\nand wings of the 538 nm and 630 nm lines to disentangle the vertical and\nhorizontal flows. To investigate how these depend on the continuum intensity,\nthe azimuthal fits are made separately for each intensity bin. By using\nspatially high-pass filtered measurements of the LOS component of the magnetic\nfield, the flow properties are determined separately for magnetic spines\n(relatively strong and vertical field) and inter-spines (weaker and more\nhorizontal field).\n  Results. The dark convective downflows discovered recently in the 538.03 nm\nline are evident also in the 630.15 nm line, and have similar strength. This\nconvective signature is the same in spines and inter-spines. However, the\nstrong radial (Evershed) outflows are found only in the inter-spines.\n  Conclusions. At the spatial resolution of the present SST/CRISP data, the\nsmall-scale intensity pattern seen in continuum images is strongly related to a\nconvective up/down flow pattern that exists everywhere in the penumbra. Earlier\nfailures to detect the dark convective downflows in the interior penumbra can\nbe explained by inadequate spatial resolution in the observed data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 21:08:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 13:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Detections are based on the\npresence of relatively strong C II 6580 absorption \"notches\" in multiple\nspectra of each SN, aided by automated fitting with the SYNAPPS code. Four of\nthe 5 SNe in question are otherwise spectroscopically unremarkable, with ions\nand ejection velocities typical of SNe Ia, but spectra of the fifth exhibits\nhigh-velocity (v > 20,000 km/s) Si II and Ca II features.

The continuum red-ward of the Lyman alpha line\nis clearly detected in both objects, thus facilitating a relatively accurate\nmeasurement (10--20% uncertainties) of the observed rest-frame equivalent\nwidths, which are around 160 Angstroms for both objects. Through detailed\nmodelling of the profile of the Lyman alpha line with a 3-D Monte-Carlo\nradiative transfer code, we estimate the intrinsic rest-frame equivalent width\nof Lyman alpha and find values that are around 300 Angstroms, which is at the\nupper end of the range allowed for very young, moderately metal-poor\nstar-forming galaxies. However, the uncertainties are large and values as high\nas 700 Angstroms are permitted by the data. Both Lyman alpha emitters are\ndetected at 3.6 micron in deep images taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nWe use these measurements, the measurement of the continuum red-ward of Lyman\nalpha and other photometry to constrain the spectral energy distributions of\nthese very luminous Lyman alpha emitters and to compare them to three similar\nLyman alpha emitters from the literature. The contribution from nebular\nemission is included in our models: excluding it results in significantly\nhigher masses. Evidence for dust is found in all objects, and emission from\nnebular lines often make a dominant contribution to the rest frame 3.6 micron\nflux.

While the former describes the\nsurprising damping of linear plasma waves in a collisionless plasma, the latter\ndescribes exact undamped nonlinear solutions of the Vlasov equation. There does\nexist a relationship between the two: Landau damping can be described as the\nphase-mixing of undamped eigenmodes, the so-called Case-Van Kampen modes, which\ncan be viewed as BGK modes in the linear limit. While these concepts have been\naround for a long time, unexpected new results are still being discovered. For\nLandau damping, we show that the textbook picture of phase-mixing is altered\nprofoundly in the presence of collision. In particular, the continuous spectrum\nof Case-Van Kampen modes is eliminated and replaced by a discrete spectrum,\neven in the limit of zero collision. Furthermore, we show that these discrete\neigenmodes form a complete set of solutions. Landau-damped solutions are then\nrecovered as true eigenmodes (which they are not in the collisionless theory).\nFor BGK modes, our interest is motivated by recent discoveries of electrostatic\nsolitary waves in magnetospheric plasmas. While one-dimensional BGK theory is\nquite mature, there appear to be no exact three-dimensional solutions in the\nliterature (except for the limiting case when the magnetic field is\nsufficiently strong so that one can apply the guiding-center approximation). We\nshow, in fact, that two- and three-dimensional solutions that depend only on\nenergy do not exist. However, if solutions depend on both energy and angular\nmomentum, we can construct exact three-dimensional solutions for the\nunmagnetized case, and two-dimensional solutions for the case with a finite\nmagnetic field. The latter are shown to be exact, fully electromagnetic\nsolutions of the steady-state Vlasov-Poisson-Amp\\`ere system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 05:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-08"}

For example, the largest eigenvectors of adjacency matrices of large\ncomplex networks often have most of their mass localized on high-degree nodes;\nand the smallest eigenvectors of the Laplacians of such networks are often\nlocalized on small but meaningful community-like sets of nodes.

The implementation of a new model of bone remodeling in PRISM has\nled to an interesting characterization of osteoporosis as a defective bone\nremodeling dynamics with respect to other bone pathologies. Our approach allows\nto derive three types of model checking-based diagnostic estimators. The first\ndiagnostic measure focuses on the level of bone mineral density, which is\ncurrently used in medical practice. In addition, we have introduced a novel\ndiagnostic estimator which uses the full patient clinical record, here\nsimulated using the modeling framework. This estimator detects rapid (months)\nnegative changes in bone mineral density. Independently of the actual bone\nmineral density, when the decrease occurs rapidly it is important to alarm the\npatient and monitor him/her more closely to detect insurgence of other bone\nco-morbidities. A third estimator takes into account the variance of the bone\ndensity, which could address the investigation of metabolic syndromes, diabetes\nand cancer. Our implementation could make use of different logical combinations\nof these statistical estimators and could incorporate other biomarkers for\nother systemic co-morbidities (for example diabetes and thalassemia). We are\ndelighted to report that the combination of stochastic modeling with formal\nmethods motivate new diagnostic framework for complex pathologies.

Hall\ndiffusion is known to be important to the magnetic field behaviour at many of\nthe intermediate densities and field strengths encountered during the\ngravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores into protostars, and yet its\nrole in the star formation process is not well-studied. We present a\nsemianalytic self-similar model of the collapse of rotating isothermal\nmolecular cloud cores with both Hall and ambipolar diffusion, and similarity\nsolutions that demonstrate the profound influence of the Hall effect on the\ndynamics of collapse.\n  The solutions show that the size and sign of the Hall parameter can change\nthe size of the protostellar disc by up to an order of magnitude and the\nprotostellar accretion rate by fifty per cent when the ratio of the Hall to\nambipolar diffusivities is varied between -0.5 <= eta_H / eta_A <= 0.2. These\nchanges depend upon the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the\naxis of rotation and create a preferred handedness to the solutions that could\nbe observed in protostellar cores using next-generation instruments such as\nALMA.\n  Hall diffusion also determines the strength and position of the shocks that\nbound the pseudo and rotationally-supported discs, and can introduce subshocks\nthat further slow accretion onto the protostar. In cores that are not initially\nrotating Hall diffusion can even induce rotation, which could give rise to disc\nformation and resolve the magnetic braking catastrophe. The Hall effect clearly\ninfluences the dynamics of gravitational collapse and its role in controlling\nthe magnetic braking and radial diffusion of the field merits further\nexploration in numerical simulations of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 06:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 22:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We find that 50%\n(25/50) of local LIRGs have an AGN component detected with this method. There\nis good agreement between these AGN detections through mid-IR spectral\ndecomposition and other AGN indicators, such as the optical spectral class,\nmid-IR spectral features and X-ray properties. Taking all the AGN indicators\ntogether, the AGN detection rate in the individual nuclei of LIRGs is ~62%. The\nderived AGN bolometric luminosities are in the range L_bol(AGN)=0.4 -50x10^{43}\nerg/s. The AGN bolometric contribution to the IR luminosities of the galaxies\nis generally small, with 70% of LIRGs having L_bol(AGN)/L_IR<0.05. Only ~8% of\nlocal LIRGs have a significant AGN bolometric contribution L_bol(AGN)/L_IR >\n0.25. From the comparison of our results with literature results of\nultraluminous infrared galaxies, we confirm that in the local universe the AGN\nbolometric contribution to the IR luminosity increases with the IR luminosity\nof the galaxy/system. If we add up the AGN bolometric luminosities we find that\nAGNs only account for 5%^{+8%}_{-3%} of the total IR luminosity produced by\nlocal LIRGs (with and without AGN detections). This proves that the bulk of the\nIR luminosity of local LIRGs is due to star formation activity.

As already reported by Nakahira et al. (2010) MAXI monitored\nthe source continuously throughout the entire outburst for about eight months.\nAll the MAXI/GSC energy spectra in the high/soft state lasting for 2 months are\nwell represented by a multi-color disk plus power-law model. The innermost disk\ntemperature changed from $\\sim$0.7 keV to $\\sim$0.4 keV and the disk flux\ndecreased by an order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the innermost radius is\nconstant at $\\sim$41 $D_{3.5}(\\cos{\\it i})^{-1/2}$ km, where $D_{3.5}$ is the\nsource distance in units of 3.5 kpc and $i$ the inclination. The multi-color\ndisk parameters obtained with the MAXI/GSC are consistent with those with the\nSwift/XRT and Suzaku. The Suzaku data also suggests a possibility that the disk\nemission is slightly Comptonized, which could account for broad iron-K features\nreported previously.

However, this is\nnot enough to yield good results, because data dependencies may \\emph{also}\nlimit the usefulness of running computations in parallel. If one computation\nblocks almost immediately and can resume only after another has completed its\nwork, then the cost of parallelization again exceeds the benefit.\n  We present a set of algorithms for recognizing places in a program where it\nis worthwhile to execute two or more computations in parallel that pay\nattention to the second of these issues as well as the first. Our system uses\nprofiling information to compute the times at which a procedure call consumes\nthe values of its input arguments and the times at which it produces the values\nof its output arguments.

Our approach is based on the use of linear syzygies by means of\napproximation complexes, following [Bus\\'e Jouanolou 03], where they develop\nthe theory for a rational map $f:P^{n-1}\\dashrightarrow P^n$. Approximation\ncomplexes were first introduced by Herzog, Simis and Vasconcelos in [Herzog\nSimis Vasconcelos 82] almost 30 years ago. The main obstruction for this\napproximation complex-based method comes from the bad behavior of the base\nlocus of $f$. Thus, it is natural to try different compatifications of\n$A^{n-1}$, that are better suited to the map $f$, in order to avoid unwanted\nbase points. With this purpose, in this thesis we study toric compactifications\n$T$ for $A^{n-1}$. We provide resolutions $Z.$ for $Sym_I(A)$, such that\n$\\det((Z.)_\\nu)$ gives a multiple of the implicit equation, for a graded strand\n$\\nu\\gg 0$.

Species-area relationships and species-abundance\ndistributions are examples of emerging patterns irrespective of the details of\nthe underlying ecosystem functions. Here we present empirical and theoretical\nevidence for a new macroecological pattern related to the distributions of\nlocal species persistence times, defined as the timespans between local\ncolonizations and extinctions in a given geographic region. Empirical\ndistributions pertaining to two different taxa, breeding birds and herbaceous\nplants, analyzed in a new framework that accounts for the finiteness of the\nobservational period, exhibit power-law scaling limited by a cut-off determined\nby the rate of emergence of new species. In spite of the differences between\ntaxa and spatial scales of analysis, the scaling exponents are statistically\nindistinguishable from each other and significantly different from those\npredicted by existing models. We theoretically investigate how the scaling\nfeatures depend on the structure of the spatial interaction network and show\nthat the empirical scaling exponents are reproduced once a two-dimensional\nisotropic texture is used, regardless of the details of the ecological\ninteractions. The framework developed here also allows to link the cut-off\ntimescale with the spatial scale of analysis, and the persistence-time\ndistribution to the species-area relationship. We conclude that the inherent\ncoherence obtained between spatial and temporal macroecological patterns points\nat a seemingly general feature of the dynamical evolution of ecosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 11:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-08"}

This\nlength gives the size of a volume such that from outside it the inside\nelectrical charges, positive and negative, electrically screen each other.\nGiven the enormous electrical potential that would develop with no screening,\nwe conjecture that the size of the Universe R, as given by the speed of light c\nand its age t, R \\approx ct, cannot be very much lower than the Debye length.\nIt turns out that it is about 1/3 \\lambdaD. Hence inside the volume of size ct\nthere is an otward electrical pressure due to the lack of complete electrical\nscreening of the charges. The Universe does not collapse under its own\ngravitational attraction, and we present the possibility that this is due to\nthe effect of the repulsive forces of these electrical charges.

It is thought that this is mainly due to the conflicting\ninformation on the mass media and to the individual attitude (formed by\ncultural, educational and environmental factors), that is, one external factor\nand another personal factor. In this paper we will investigate the dynamical\ndevelopment of opinion in a small population of agents by means of a\ncomputational model of opinion formation in a co-evolving network of socially\nlinked agents. The personal and external factors are taken into account by\nassigning an individual attitude parameter to each agent, and by subjecting all\nto an external but homogeneous field to simulate the effect of the media. We\nthen adjust the field strength in the model by using actual data on scientific\nperception surveys carried out in two different populations, which allow us to\ncompare two different societies. We interpret the model findings with the aid\nof simple mean field calculations. Our results suggest that scientifically\nsound concepts are more difficult to acquire than concepts not validated by\nscience, since opposing individuals organize themselves in close communities\nthat prevent opinion consensus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 15:29:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 08:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-04"}

The field is\nprepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state and is constrained to satisfy Robin\nboundary conditions on the sphere. Both the interior and exterior regions are\nconsidered. For the calculation in the interior region, a mode-summation method\nis employed, supplemented with a variant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula.\nThis allows us to explicitly extract the contributions to the expectation\nvalues which come from de Sitter spacetime without boundaries. We show that the\nvacuum energy-momentum tensor is non-diagonal with the off-diagonal component\ncorresponding to the energy flux along the radial direction. With dependence on\nthe boundary condition and the mass of the field, this flux can be either\npositive or negative. Several limiting cases of interest are then studied. In\nterms of the curvature coupling parameter and the mass of the field, two very\ndifferent regimes are realized, which exhibit monotonic and oscillatory\nbehavior of the vacuum expectation values, respectively, far from the sphere.\nThe decay of the boundary induced expectation values at large distances from\nthe sphere is shown to be power-law (monotonic or oscillating), independent of\nthe value of the field mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 15:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 15:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

The latter type is characterized by spectra of no\nindication of strong winds as well as a long-lasted flat optical peak in its\nlight curve. We propose a transition from no-optically-thick-wind evolution to\nusual evolution with optically thick winds as a new outburst model for slow\nnovae that show a relatively long-lasted multipeak phase followed by a wind\nphase like in the slow novae V723 Cas, HR Del, and V5558 Sgr.
