The metric is defined using a maximum likelihood detection\nstatistic applied to a binary orbit phase model including eccentricity.

In particular, the results\nare predicted to be dependent both on the geometry of the emitting plasma and\nthe orientation of the observer. Hence in principle the detection of intensity\nenhancement may provide a way of determining the geometry of an unresolved\nastronomical source. To investigate such enhancements we have analyzed a sample\nof active late-type stars observed in the far ultraviolet spectral region.\nEmission lines of O VI in the FUSE satellite spectra of epsilon Eri, II Peg and\nProx Cen were searched for intensity enhancements due to opacity. We have found\nstrong evidence for line intensity enhancements due to opacity during active or\nflare-like activity for all three stars. The O VI 1032/1038 line intensity\nratios, predicted to have a value of 2.0 in the optically thin case, are found\nto be up to ~30% larger during several orbital phases. Our measurements,\ncombined with radiative transfer models, allow us to constrain both the\ngeometry of the O VI emitting regions in our stellar sources and the\norientation of the observer. A spherical emitting plasma can be ruled out, as\nthis would lead to no intensity enhancement. In addition, the theory tells us\nthat the line-of-sight to the plasma must be close to perpendicular to its\nsurface, as observations at small angles to the surface lead to either no\nintensity enhancement or the usual line intensity decrease over the optically\nthin value. For the future, we outline a laboratory experiment, that could be\nundertaken with current facilities, which would provide an unequivocal test of\npredictions of line intensity enhancement due to opacity, in particular the\ndependence on plasma geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 18:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In this paper\nwe explore the behavior of these coordinates for Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse,\ni.e., the collapse of a uniform density, pressureless sphere of dust initially\nat rest to a black hole. Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse provides a stringent test\nof the singularity-avoiding properties of moving-puncture coordinates, since\nthe singularity can form more quickly than it would for matter with pressure.\nOur results include analytical expressions for the matter density, lapse\nfunction, and mean curvature at early times, as well as interesting limits for\nlater times.

By construction, our method accounts for all relevant\ndensity and velocity modes and so is unaffected by the limited box size of our\nsimulations. We find that radiative cooling and star-formation can reduce the\namplitude of the kSZ power spectrum by up to 33%, or 1 uK^2 at ell = 3000. This\nis driven by a decrease in the mean gas density in groups and clusters due to\nthe conversion of gas into stars.

We demonstrate how the\nmodels presented in this work can be constrained -- reducing the astrophysical\nuncertainty on the kSZ signal -- by measuring the redshift dependence of the\nsignal via kSZ tomography.

This scheme combines\ntools from different techniques in General Relativity: It uses a multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian (MPM) expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (which\nprovides the gravitational waveforms, here taken up to mass hexadecapole and\ncurrent octopole order) and for the local prescription of the self-force (since\nwe are lacking a general prescription for it); a post-Newtonian expansion for\nthe computation of the multipole moments in terms of the trajectories; and a BH\nperturbation theory expansion when treating the trajectories as a sequence of\nself-adjusting Kerr geodesics. The orbital evolution is thus equivalent to\nsolving the geodesic equations with time-dependent orbital elements, as\ndictated by the MPM radiation-reaction prescription. To complete the scheme,\nboth the orbital evolution and wave generation require to map the\nBoyer-Lindquist coordinates of the orbits to the harmonic coordinates in which\nthe different MPM quantities have been derived, a mapping that we provide\nexplicitly in this paper. This new kludge scheme is thus a combination of\napproximations that can be used to model generic inspirals of systems with\nextreme mass ratios to systems with more moderate mass ratios, and hence can\nprovide valuable information for future space-based gravitational-wave\nobservatories like LISA and even for advanced ground detectors. Finally, due to\nthe local character in time of our MPM self-force, this scheme can be used to\nperform studies of the possible appearance of transient resonances in generic\ninspirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 22:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2011 11:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The present study aims to identify conditions under\nwhich magnetic field dependence can be observed in electronic conduction\nthrough such molecules. We consider molecular ring structures modeled both\nwithin the tight-binding (H\\\"uckel) model and as continuous rings. In fact,\nmuch of the observed qualitative behavior can be rationalized in terms of a\nmuch simpler two-state model. Dephasing in these models is affected by two\ncommon tools: the B\\\"uttiker probe method and coherence damping within a\ndensity matrix formulation. We show that current through a benzene ring can be\ncontrolled by moderate fields provided that (a) conduction must be dominated by\ndegenerate (in the free molecule) molecular electronic resonances, associated\nwith multiple pathways as is often the case with ring molecules; (b)\nmolecular-leads electronic coupling must is weak so as to affect relatively\ndistinct conduction resonances; (c) molecular binding to the leads must be\nasymmetric (e.g., for benzene, connection in the meta or ortho, but not para,\nconfigurations) and, (d) dephasing has to be small. Under these conditions,\nconsiderable sensitivity to an imposed magnetic field normal to the molecular\nring plane is found in benzene and other aromatic molecules. Interestingly, in\nsymmetric junctions (e.g. para connected benzene) a large sensitivity of the\ntransmission coefficient to magnetic field is not reflected in the\ncurrent-voltage characteristic. Although sensitivity to magnetic field is\nsuppressed by dephasing, quantitative estimates indicate that magnetic field\ncontrol can be observed under realistic condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2011 13:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}

Optical images\nhave been used to model the host galaxy morphology confirming it to be\ndominated by a strong (and warped) disk component that is observed close to\nedge-on. At radio wavelengths, PKS1814-637 is about 480 pc in diameter and it\nis classified as a compact steep spectrum source; such sources are usually\nconsidered to be radio sources observed in the early stages of their evolution.\nHowever, the optical and mid-IR spectroscopic properties of PKS1814-637 show\nmore in common with Seyfert galaxies than they do with radio galaxies, with the\ndetection of H_2, and PAH emission features, along with HI and silicate\nabsorption features, providing evidence for a rich ISM, likely related to the\ndisk morphology of the host galaxy. The interaction between the radio plasma\nand the rich ISM in this and similar objects may have boosted their radio\nemission, allowing them to more easily enter flux limited samples of radio\nsources. In this case, PKS1814-637 represents a type of \"imposter\": an\nintrinsically low power object that is selected in a radio flux limited sample\nbecause of the unusually efficient conversion of jet power into radio emission.\nThis would make PKS1814-637 an extreme example of the effects of jet-cloud\ninteractions in galaxies containing a rich ISM, and perhaps a missing link\nbetween radio galaxies and radio-loud Seyfert galaxies. However, it is probable\nthat the jet in PKS1814-637 is also intrinsically more powerful than in typical\nSeyfert galaxies. The estimated BH mass is indeed higher than the majority of\nSeyfert galaxies in the local Universe. We speculate that sources similar to\nPKS1814-637 are likely to be more common at high redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2011 15:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
