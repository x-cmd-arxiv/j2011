The optical light\ncurve can be described by an exponential decay followed by a plateau, then a\nmore rapid fade towards quiescence. The plateau appears to be due to an extra\ncomponent of optical emission that brightens and then fades over ~ 40 days. We\nshow evidence for the origin of this optical 'flare' to be the synchrotron jet\nduring the decaying hard state, and we identify and isolate both disc and jet\ncomponents in the spectral energy distributions. The optical flare has the same\nmorphology and amplitude as a contemporaneous X-ray rebrightening. This\nsuggests a common origin, but no firm conclusions can be made favouring or\ndisfavouring the jet producing the X-ray flare. The quiescent optical\nmagnitudes are B >= 20.6, V >= 21.1, R >= 19.5, i' >= 19.2. From the optical\noutburst amplitude we estimate a likely orbital period of < 22 h. We also\npresent near-infrared (NIR) photometry and polarimetry and rare mid-infrared\nimaging (8 - 12 microns) when the source is nearing quiescence. The fading jet\ncomponent, and possibly the companion star may contribute to the NIR flux. We\nderive deep mid-IR flux upper limits and NIR linear polarization upper limits.\nWith the inclusion of radio data, we measure an almost flat jet spectral index\nbetween radio and optical; F_nu ~ nu^(~ +0.05). The data favour the jet break\nto optically thin emission to reside in the infrared, but may shift to\nfrequencies as high as the optical or UV during the peak of the flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 16:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

With investigation of the\nvariations in the quasar inner structure we explore how much this effect can\naffect the position determination and whether it can be (or not) detected with\nGaia mission.

We\nestimated the value of the photocenter offset due to these two effects. We\nfound that perturbations in the inner structure can significantly offset the\nphotocenter. It depends on the characteristics of perturbation and accretion\ndisk and structure of the torus. In the case of two considered QSOs the\nobserved photocenter offsets cannot be explained by variations in the accretion\ndisk and other effects should be considered.

Over recent years enormous progress has been\nmade in controlling the interface between light and single emitters including\nions, atoms, molecules, quantum dots and ensembles. For many systems,\ninter-particle interactions are typically negligible. However, if the emitters\nare separated by less than the emission wavelength, resonant dipole--dipole\ninteractions modify the radiative decay rate and induce a splitting or shift of\nthe resonance. Here we map out the transition between individual dipoles and a\nstrongly interacting ensemble by increasing the density of atoms confined in a\nlayer with thickness much less than the emission wavelength. We find two\nsurprising results: whereas for a non-interacting ensemble the opacity\nincreases linearly with atomic density, for an interacting ensemble the opacity\nsaturates, i.e., a thin dipolar layer never becomes opaque regardless of how\nmany scatterers are added. Secondly, the relative phase of the dipoles produces\nan abrupt change in the optical transmission around the thickness \\lambda/4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 17:26:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 13:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}

Aims: We produce a stellar bow-shock catalogue by applying uniform\nsearch criteria and a systematic search process. This catalogue is a starting\npoint for statistical studies, to help us address fundamental questions such\nas, for instance, the conditions under wich a stellar bow shock is detectable.\nMethods: By using the newest infrared data releases, we carried out a search\nfor bow shocks produced by early-type runaway stars. We first explored whether\na set of known IRAS bow shock candidates are visible in the most recently\navailable IR data, which has much higher resolution and sensitivity. We then\ncarried out a selection of runaway stars from the latest, large runaway\ncatalogue available. In this first release, we focused on OB stars and searched\nfor bow-shaped features in the vicinity of these stars. Results: We provide a\nbow-shock candidate survey that gathers a total of 28 members which we call the\nExtensive stellar BOw Shock Survey (E-BOSS). We derive the main bow-shock\nparameters, and present some preliminary statistical results on the detected\nobjects. Conclusions: Our analysis of the initial sample and the newly detected\nobjects yields a bow-shock detectability around OB stars of $\\sim$ 10 per cent.\nThe detections do not seem to depend particularly on either stellar mass, age\nor position. The extension of the E-BOSS sample, with upcoming IR data, and by\nconsidering, for example, other spectral types as well, will allow us to\nperform a more detailed study of the findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 18:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 20:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

After a contraction timescale which is equal to a few\ntimes their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and populate the\nIMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account in the form\nof stellar winds. When the ratio of the effective energy of the winds to the\ngravitational energy of the system reaches unity, gas is removed from the clump\nand core and star formation are quenched. The power of the radiation driven\nwinds has a strong dependence on metallicity and it increases with increasing\nmetallicity.

Under ideal MHD conditions, the removal of angular momentum\nfrom the disk progenitor by the typically embedded magnetic field may prevent\nthe formation of a rotationally supported disk during the main protostellar\naccretion phase of low mass stars. This has been known as the magnetic braking\nproblem and the most investigated mechanism to alleviate this problem and help\nremoving the excess of magnetic flux during the star formation process, the so\ncalled ambipolar diffusion (AD), has been shown to be not sufficient to weaken\nthe magnetic braking at least at this stage of the disk formation. In this\nwork, motivated by recent progress in the understanding of magnetic\nreconnection in turbulent environments, we appeal to the diffusion of magnetic\nfield mediated by magnetic reconnection as an alternative mechanism for\nremoving magnetic flux. We investigate numerically this mechanism during the\nlater phases of the protostellar disk formation and show its high efficiency.\nBy means 3D MHD simulations, we show that this mechanism is able to transport\nmagnetic flux to the outskirts of the disk progenitor at time scales compatible\nwith the collapse, allowing the formation of a rotationally supported disk\naround the protostar of dimensions ~100 AU. Since MHD turbulence is expected to\nbe present in protostellar disks, this is a natural mechanism for removing\nmagnetic flux excess and allowing the formation of these disks. This mechanism\ndismiss the necessity of postulating a hypothetical increase of the Ohmic\nresistivity as discussed in the literature. Together with our earlier work\nwhich showed that magnetic flux removal from molecular cloud cores is very\nefficient, this work calls for reconsidering the relative role of AD for the\nprocesses of star and planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 20:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The Cen A was in the active phase in\n2009, and the flux became higher by a factor of 1.5--2.0 and the spectrum\nbecame harder than that in 2005. The Fe-K line intensity increased by 20--30%\nfrom 2005 to 2009. The correlation of the count rate between the XIS 3--8 keV\nand PIN 15--40 keV band showed a complex behavior with a deviation from a\nlinear relation. The wide-band X-ray continuum in 2--200 keV can be fitted with\nan absorbed powerlaw model plus a reflection component, or a powerlaw with a\npartial covering Compton-thick absorption. The difference spectra between high\nand low flux periods in each observation were reproduced by a powerlaw with a\npartial covering Compton-thick absorption.

It is\nassumed that the agents have identical nominal dynamics while subject to\ndifferent norm-bounded parameter uncertainties, leading to weakly heterogeneous\nmulti-agent systems. Distributed controllers are designed for both continuous-\nand discrete-time multi-agent systems, based on the relative states of\nneighboring agents and a subset of absolute states of the agents. It is shown\nfor both the continuous- and discrete-time cases that the distributed robust\ncontrol problems under such controllers in the sense of quadratic stability are\nequivalent to the $H_\\infty$ control problems of a set of decoupled linear\nsystems having the same dimensions as a single agent. A two-step algorithm is\npresented to construct the distributed controller for the continuous-time case,\nwhich does not involve any conservatism and meanwhile decouples the feedback\ngain design from the communication topology.

MCs transport magnetic flux and helicity away from the Sun. These\nstructures are not stationary but feature temporal evolution as they propagate\nin the solar wind. Simplified analytical models are frequently used for the\ndescription of MCs, and fit certain observational data well. The goal of the\npresent study is to investigate numerically the validity of an analytical model\nwhich is widely used for the description of MCs, and to determine under which\nconditions this model's implied assumptions cease to be valid. A numerical\napproach is applied. Analytical solutions that have been derived in previous\nstudies are implemented in a \\textbf{3-D magnetohydrodynamic} simulation code\nas initial conditions. Initially, the analytical model represents the main\nobservational features of the MCs. However, these characteristics prevail only\nif the structure moves with a velocity close to the velocity of the background\nflow. In this case an MC's evolution can quite accurately be described using an\nanalytic, self-similar approach. The dynamics of the magnetic structures which\nmove with a velocity significantly above or below that of the velocity of the\nsolar wind is investigated in detail. Besides the standard case in which MCs\nonly expand and propagate in the solar wind, the case of an MC rotating around\nits axis of symmetry is also considered, and the resulting influence on the\nMC's dynamics is studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2011 15:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Almost all previous studies on the orbital and accretional\nevolution of protoplanets in this stage have been based on the assumption of\nperfect accretion, where two colliding protoplanets always merge. However,\nrecent impact simulations have shown that collisions among protoplanets are not\nalways merging events, that is, two colliding protoplanets sometimes move apart\nafter the collision (hit-and-run collision). As a first step towards studying\nthe effects of such imperfect accretion of protoplanets on terrestrial planet\nformation, we investigated the merging criteria for collisions of rocky\nprotoplanets. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) method, we\nperformed more than 1000 simulations of giant impacts with various parameter\nsets, such as the mass ratio of protoplanets, $\\gamma$, the total mass of two\nprotoplanets, $M_{\\rm T}$, the impact angle, $\\theta$, and the impact velocity,\n$v_{\\rm imp}$. We investigated the critical impact velocity, $v_{\\rm cr}$, at\nthe transition between merging and hit-and-run collisions. We found that the\nnormalized critical impact velocity, $v_{\\rm cr}/v_{\\rm esc}$, depends on\n$\\gamma$ and $\\theta$, but does not depend on $M_{\\rm T}$, where $v_{\\rm esc}$\nis the two-body escape velocity. We derived a simple formula for $v_{\\rm\ncr}/v_{\\rm esc}$ as a function of $\\gamma$ and $\\theta$, and applied it to the\ngiant impact events obtained by \\textit{N}-body calculations in the previous\nstudies. We found that 40% of these events should not be merging events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 23:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

For $\\Gamma_h$, we select the edges that have both\nvertices on one side of $\\Gamma$ and belong to a triangle that has a vertex on\nthe other side. By imposing restrictions on the size of triangles near the\ncurve and by requesting that certain angles in the mesh be strictly acute, we\nprove that $\\pi:\\Gamma_h\\rightarrow\\Gamma$ is a homeomorphism, that it is $C^1$\non each edge in $\\Gamma_h$ and provide bounds for the Jacobian of the\nparameterization. The assumptions on the background mesh are both easy to\nsatisfy in practice and conveniently verified in computer implementations. The\nparameterization analyzed here was previously proposed by the authors and\napplied to the construction of high-order curved finite elements on a class of\nplanar piecewise $C^2$-curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 19:27:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2013 03:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}
