The X-ray data, when combined with\noptical luminosities, show that in fact none of the 10 galaxies have a\nsignificant AGN component; if there is any nuclear activity at all, it is weak\nrather than obscured. This reduces the number of UHECRs in the original Auger\ndataset possibly correlating with AGNs from 20 of 27 down to 14 of 27. We also\nused Chandra to measure the X-ray luminosity of ESO 139-G12, an AGN which\ncorrelates with 2 of the Auger UHECRs, to obtain the first estimate of its\nbolometric luminosity; this completes the determination of the bolometric\nluminosities of all correlating AGNs.

Intriguingly, approximately 60% of the\nUHECRs with $|b|>10^\\circ$ do correlate with genuine AGNs, but these are too\nweak to meet the acceleration criterion for protons; this may be an indication\nthat AGNs experience transient high-luminosity states which can accelerate\nUHECRs.

Being highly non-linear and stochastic, the outcome\nof collapse can only be explored theoretically by performing large ensembles of\nnumerical simulations. Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk). In this paper, we present a numerical study of the influence of the details\nof the turbulent velocity field on the collapse of an isolated, weakly\nturbulent, low-mass prestellar core. We show that, as long as n > 3 (as is\nusually assumed), a more critical parameter than n is the maximum wavelength in\nthe turbulent velocity field, {\\lambda}_MAX. This is because {\\lambda}_MAX\ncarries most of the turbulent energy, and thereby influences both the amount\nand the spatial coherence of the angular momentum in the core. We show that the\nformation of dense filaments during collapse depends critically on\n{\\lambda}_MAX, and we explain this finding using a force balance analysis. We\nalso show that the core only has a high probability of fragmenting if\n{\\lambda}_MAX > 0.5 R_CORE (where R_CORE is the core radius); that the dominant\nmode of fragmentation involves the formation and break-up of filaments; and\nthat, although small protostellar disks (with radius R_DISK <= 20 AU) form\nroutinely, more extended disks are rare. In turbulent, low-mass cores of the\ntype we simulate here, the formation of large, fragmenting protostellar disks\nis suppressed by early fragmentation in the filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

UV fields around\nlow-mass pre-main sequence stars, around shocks and in many other astrophysical\nenvironments are however often dominated by discrete atomic and molecular\nemission lines. It is therefore crucial to consider the wavelength dependence\nof photodesorption yields and mechanisms. In this work, for the first time, the\nwavelength-dependent photodesorption of pure CO ice is explored between 90 and\n170 nm.

This has direct applications in the field of space\nweather as we discuss specifically for the case of the solar power influx into\nthe magnetosphere.

We use a set of large (~10^6 Mpc^3) cosmological SPH\nsimulations that include a detailed treatment of star formation, feedback,\nmetal enrichment and supernova dust production; these same simulations have\nalready been shown to successfully reproduce a large number of observed\nproperties of LAEs (Dayal et al. 2010). We identify LBGs as galaxies with an\nabsolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitude M_{UV} <= -17, consistent with current\nobservational criteria. With no further parameter tuning, the model reproduces\nthe redshift evolution of the LBG UV luminosity function, stellar mass\nfunction, and star formation rate (SFR) density extremely well, compared to the\ndata at z~6-8. It predicts a z-independent average beta value of about -2.2,\nconsistent with the most recent observational results. The mean LBG specific\nSFR increases from 6.7 Gyr^-1 at z ~ 6 to 13.9 Gyr^-1 at z ~ 8, and is largest\nfor the smallest LBGs. From a comparison of the simulated LAE and LBG\npopulations, we find no appreciable differences between them in terms of the\nstellar masses, ages, SFR, and dust content; only the faintest LBGs with M_{UV}\n>= -18 (-19) at z ~ 6 (8) do not show an observable Lyman Alpha line. LAEs\nhence represent a luminous LBG subset, whose relative extent depends only on\nthe adopted equivalent width (EW) selection criteria. Further, in line with\ncurrent observations, we find that the fraction of LBGs showing a Lyman Alpha\nline decreases with increasing redshift due to the combined effects of dust and\nreionization. We conclude with a brief critical model discussion, which\nemphasizes the uncertainties inherent to theoretical EW determinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 20:27:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 16:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

These\napproximations are correct not only in the regime of strong scattering, where\nthe evolution is indeed controlled by the 'virtual' terms, but also in the\nregime of weak scattering, where they reduce to the corresponding BFKL\nsolutions. This last feature follows from the fact that the JIMWLK Hamiltonian\nis a linear combination of the pieces responsible for the 'real' and 'virtual'\nterms, respectively. We apply this scheme to two examples: the 'color\nquadrupole' (the 4-point function of the Wilson lines which enters the\ncross-section for the production of a pair of jets at forward rapidities) and\nthe 'color sextupole' (the 6-point function). For particular configurations of\nthe quadrupole, our general formula reduces to relatively simple expressions\nthat have been previously proposed on the basis of the McLerran-Venugopalan\nmodel and which were recently shown to agree quite well with exact, numerical,\nsolutions to the JIMWLK equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 20:55:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 14:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 22:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-27"}

We used a\nsample of 30 M0-M5.5 stars from the HARPS M-dwarf planet search program with a\nmedian timespan of observations of 5.2 years. We computed chromospheric\nactivity indicators based on the Ca II H and K, H{\\alpha}, He I D3, and Na I D1\nand D2 lines. All data were binned in to average out undesired effects such as\nrotationally modulated atmospheric inhomogeneities.

While the S_CaII, H{\\alpha}, and Na I indices showed significant\nvariability for a fraction of our stellar sample (39%, 33%, and 37%,\nrespectively), only 10% of our stars presented significant variability in the\nHe i index. We therefore conclude that this index is a poor activity indicator\nat least for this type of stars. Although the H{\\alpha} shows good correlation\nwith S_Ca II for the most active stars, the correlation is lost when the\nactivity level decreases. This result appears to indicate that the Ca\nII-H{\\alpha} correlation is dependent on the activity level of the star. The Na\nI lines correlate very well with the S_Ca II index for the stars with low\nactivity levels we used, and are thus a good chromospheric activity proxy for\nearly-M dwarfs. We therefore strongly recommend the use of the Na I activity\nindex because the signal-to-noise ratio in the sodium lines spectral region is\nalways higher than for the calcium lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 22:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-05"}

The interaction of the micro-cantilever tip with the\nspecimen causes cantilever deflections that are measured by an optical sensing\nmechanism and subsequently utilized to construct the sample topography. Recent\nyears have seen increased interest in using the AFM to characterize soft\nspecimens like gels and live cells. This remains challenging due to the complex\nand competing nature of tip-sample interaction forces - large tip-sample\ninteraction force is necessary to achieve good signal-to-noise ratios; However,\nlarge force tends to deform and destroy soft samples. In situ estimation of the\nlocal tip-sample interaction force is needed to control the AFM cantilever\nmotion and prevent destruction of soft samples while maintaining a good\nsignal-to-noise ratio. This necessitates the ability to rapidly estimate the\ntip-sample forces from the cantilever deflection during operation. This paper\nproposes a first approach to a near real-time framework for tip-sample force\ninversion.

We find that correlations disappear very\nquickly with rapidity even inside the saturation radius. This is in accordance\nwith our physical picture of JIMWLK evolution. The actual correlations inside\nthe saturation radius in the target QCD wave function, on the other hand should\nremain sizable at any rapidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 03:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The\nexisting LRR solver is based on the alternating direction method (ADM). It\nsuffers from $O(n^3)$ computation complexity due to the matrix-matrix\nmultiplications and matrix inversions, even if partial SVD is used. Moreover,\nintroducing auxiliary variables also slows down the convergence. Such a heavy\ncomputation load prevents LRR from large scale applications. In this paper, we\ngeneralize ADM by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and allowing the\npenalty to change adaptively. We also propose a novel rule to update the\npenalty such that the convergence is fast. With our linearized ADM with\nadaptive penalty (LADMAP) method, it is unnecessary to introduce auxiliary\nvariables and invert matrices. The matrix-matrix multiplications are further\nalleviated by using the skinny SVD representation technique. As a result, we\narrive at an algorithm for LRR with complexity $O(rn^2)$, where $r$ is the rank\nof the representation matrix. Numerical experiments verify that for LRR our\nLADMAP method is much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. Although we only\npresent the results on LRR, LADMAP actually can be applied to solving more\ngeneral convex programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 06:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-05"}

When $n=1$ the ground state eigenvector of the transfer matrix of\nthis model can be interpreted as a probability distribution of the possible\nstates of the system. Because of special properties the transfer matrix has at\n$n=1$, we can show that the eigenvector is a solution of the q-deformed\nKnizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation, and we use this fact to explicitly calculate\nsome of the components of the eigenvector. In addition, recursive properties of\nthe transfer matrix allow us to compute the normalisation of the eigenvector,\nand show that it is the product of four Weyl characters of the symplectic\ngroup. The boundary condition of this model lends itself to calculations\nrelating to horizontal percolation. One of these calculations is a type of\ncorrelation function that can be interpreted as the density of percolation\ncluster crossings between the two boundaries of the lattice.

The difficulty arises from the fact that information about all\npossible low-energy spin excitations of the electrons, and their coupling to\nthe nuclear moments, is folded into a single number, 1/T1. Here we develop a\nquantitative theory of the NMR 1/T1 relaxation rate in a collinear\nantiferromagnet, focusing on the specific example of BaFe2As2. One of the most\nstriking features of magnetism in BaFe2As2 is a strong dependence of 1/T1 on\nthe orientation of the applied magnetic field. By careful analysis of the\ncoupling between the nuclear and electronic moments, we show how this\nanisotropy arises from the \"filtering\" of spin fluctuations by the form-factor\nfor transferred hyperfine interactions. This allows us to make convincing,\nquantitative, fits to experimental 1/T1 data for BaFe2As2, for different field\norientations.

This is explained on the basis of the H-T path\ndependent size of the critical radii of the nuclei and the subsequent growth of\nthe equilibrium phase through the motion of the interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 10:32:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 09:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

First, we find that\na genuinely charged matter source may appear neutral to an external observer -\na phenomenon opposite to the famous Misner-Wheeler \"charge without charge\"\neffect. This phenomenon takes place when coupling a bulk\ngravity/nonlinear-gauge-field system to a charged lightlike brane as a matter\nsource. The \"charge-hiding\" effect occurs in a wormhole solution which connects\na non-compact \"universe\", comprising the exterior region of\nSchwarzschild-(anti-)de-Sitter (SdS) or purely Schwarzschild black hole beyond\nthe Schwarzschild horizon, to a Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson-type (LCBR)\n\"tube-like\" \"universe\" via a wormhole \"throat\" occupied by the brane. In this\nsolution the whole electric flux produced by the brane is expelled into the\n\"tube-like\" \"universe\" and the brane is detected as neutral by an observer in\nthe non-compact \"universe\". Next, we find a truly charge-confining wormhole\nsolution when we couple the bulk gravity/nonlinear-gauge-field system to two\noppositely charged lightlike branes. The latter system possesses a \"two-throat\"\nwormhole solution, where the \"left-most\" and the \"right-most\" \"universes\" are\ntwo identical copies of the exterior region of SdS black hole beyond the\nSchwarzschild horizon, whereas the \"middle\" \"universe\" is of LCBR \"tube-like\"\nform with geometry dS_2 x S^2. It comprises the finite-extent intermediate\nregion of dS_2 between its two horizons. Both \"throats\" are occupied by the two\noppositely charged lightlike branes and the whole electric flux produced by the\nlatter is confined entirely within the middle \"tube-like\" \"universe\". A crucial\ningredient is the special form of the nonlinear gauge field action, which\ncontains both the standard Maxwell term as well as a square root of the latter.\nThis theory was previously shown to produce a QCD-like confining dynamics in\nflat space-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 14:25:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 17:20:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 07:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This most likely generic anomalous behaviour of the OBSM has been\nshown to be due to a strong nonlocal electron-phonon interaction (EPI) mediated\nby charge fluctuations on the ions. The modeling of the competing electronic\nstates of the cuprates is achieved in terms of consecutive orbital selective\nincompressibility-compressibility transitions for the charge response.

Financial firms bailed-out as a consequence of the 2007-2010 credit\ncrisis show a neat increase with time of the generalized Hurst exponent in the\nperiod preceding the unfolding of the crisis. Conversely, firms belonging to\nother market sectors, which suffered the least throughout the crisis, show\nopposite behaviors. These findings suggest the possibility of using the scaling\nbehavior as a tool to track the level of stability of a firm. In this paper, we\nintroduce a method to compute the generalized Hurst exponent which assigns\nlarger weights to more recent events with respect to older ones. In this way\nlarge fluctuations in the remote past are less likely to influence the recent\npast. We also investigate the scaling associated with the tails of the\nlog-returns distributions and compare this scaling with the scaling associated\nwith the Hurst exponent, observing that the processes underlying the price\ndynamics of these firms are truly multi-scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 14:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-24"}

[...] The standard SK relation between surface\ndensities of cold (neutral+molecular) gas and star formation rate of simulated\ngalaxies shows a steepening at low gas surface densities, starting from a knee\nwhose position depends on disc gas fraction: for more gas-rich discs the\nsteepening takes place at higher surface densities. Because gas fraction and\nmetallicity are typically related, this environmental dependence mimics the\npredictions of models where the formation of H2 is modulated by metallicity.\nThe cold gas surface density at which HI and molecular gas surface densities\nequate can range from ~10 up to 34 Msun/pc^2. As expected, the SK relation\nobtained using molecular gas shows much smaller variations among simulations.\nWe find that disc pressure is not well represented by the classical external\npressure of a disc in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Instead is well fit by\nthe expression P_fit = Sigma_cold sigma_cold kappa / 6, where the three\nquantities on the right-hand side are cold gas surface density, vertical\nvelocity dispersion and epicyclic frequency. When the \"dynamical\" SK relation,\ni.e. the relation that uses gas surface density divided by orbital time, is\nconsidered, we find that all of our simulations stay on the same relation. We\ninterpret this as a manifestation of the equilibrium between energy injection\nand dissipation in stationary galaxy discs, when energetic feedback is\neffective and pressure is represented by the expression given above. These\nfindings further support the idea that a realistic model of the structure of\ngalaxy discs should take into account energy injection by SNe.

The variational parameters appear in the\napproximate model in a way that is similar to Breiman's Garrote model. We refer\nto this method as the variational Garrote (VG). We show that the combination of\nthe variational approximation and $L_0$ regularization has the effect of making\nthe problem effectively of maximal rank even when the number of samples is\nsmall compared to the number of variables. The VG is compared numerically with\nthe Lasso method, ridge regression and the recently introduced paired mean\nfield method (PMF) (M. Titsias & M. L\\'azaro-Gredilla., NIPS 2012). Numerical\nresults show that the VG and PMF yield more accurate predictions and more\naccurately reconstruct the true model than the other methods. It is shown that\nthe VG finds correct solutions when the Lasso solution is inconsistent due to\nlarge input correlations. Globally, VG is significantly faster than PMF and\ntends to perform better as the problems become denser and in problems with\nstrongly correlated inputs. The naive implementation of the VG scales cubic\nwith the number of features. By introducing Lagrange multipliers we obtain a\ndual formulation of the problem that scales cubic in the number of samples, but\nclose to linear in the number of features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 15:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2011 15:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 16:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

To illustrate applications of this to cosmology, we explicitly\ngive a dimensionless version of the parameters of the standard cosmological\nmodel, and describe the physics of Big Bang Neucleosynthesis and recombination\nin a dimensionless manner. The issue that appears to have been missed in many\nstudies is that in cosmology the strength of gravity is bound up in the\ncosmological equations, and the epoch at which we live is a crucial part of the\nmodel. We argue that it is useful to consider the hypothetical situation of\ncommunicating with another civilization (with entirely different units),\ncomparing only dimensionless constants, in order to decide if we live in a\nUniverse governed by precisely the same physical laws. In this thought\nexperiment, we would also have to compare epochs, which can be defined by\ngiving the value of any {\\it one} of the evolving cosmological parameters. By\nsetting things up carefully in this way one can avoid inconsistent results when\nconsidering variable constants, caused by effectively fixing more than one\nparameter today. We show examples of this effect by considering microwave\nbackground anisotropies, being careful to maintain dimensionlessness\nthroughout. We present Fisher matrix calculations to estimate how well the fine\nstructure constants for electromagnetism and gravity can be determined with\nfuture microwave background experiments. We highlight how one can be misled by\nsimply adding $G$ to the usual cosmological parameter set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2011 15:59:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2011 22:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 00:42:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 23:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-28"}
