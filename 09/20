Due to the\ntime-of-use electricity pricing, electricity can also be purchased from the\ngrid when the price is low, and be sold back to the grid when the price is\nhigh. The objective is to minimize the cost associated with purchasing from (or\nselling back to) the electric grid and the battery capacity loss while at the\nsame time satisfying the load and reducing the peak electricity purchase from\nthe grid. Essentially, the objective function depends on the chosen battery\nsize. We want to find a unique critical value (denoted as $C_{ref}^c$) of the\nbattery size such that the total cost remains the same if the battery size is\nlarger than or equal to $C_{ref}^c$, and the cost is strictly larger if the\nbattery size is smaller than $C_{ref}^c$.

We construct networks consisting of three stages of nodes.\nThe nodes in the first stage are the entry points that act as sources for the\nlive streams. Each source forwards each of its streams to one or more nodes in\nthe second stage that are called reflectors. A reflector can split an incoming\nstream into multiple identical outgoing streams, which are then sent on to\nnodes in the third and final stage that act as sinks and are located in edge\nnetworks near end-users. As the packets in a stream travel from one stage to\nthe next, some of them may be lost. A sink combines the packets from multiple\ninstances of the same stream (by reordering packets and discarding duplicates)\nto form a single instance of the stream with minimal loss. Our primary\ncontribution is an algorithm that constructs an overlay network that provably\nsatisfies capacity and reliability constraints to within a constant factor of\noptimal, and minimizes cost to within a logarithmic factor of optimal. Further\nin the common case where only the transmission costs are minimized, we show\nthat our algorithm produces a solution that has cost within a factor of 2 of\noptimal.

Each core accretes at a constant rate onto its protostar,\nwhile the surrounding clump gas accretes as a power of protostar mass. Short\naccretion flows resemble Shu accretion, and make low-mass stars. Long flows\nresemble reduced Bondi accretion and make massive stars. Accretion stops due to\nenvironmental processes of dynamical ejection, gravitational competition, and\ngas dispersal by stellar feedback, independent of initial core structure. The\nmodel matches the field star IMF from 0.01 to more than 10 solar masses. The\ncore accretion rate and the mean accretion duration set the peak of the IMF,\nindependent of the local Jeans mass. Massive protostars require the longest\naccretion durations, up to 0.5 Myr. The maximum protostar luminosity in a\ncluster indicates the mass and age of its oldest protostar. The distribution of\nprotostar luminosities matches those in active star-forming regions if\nprotostars have a constant birthrate but not if their births are coeval.

Our results imply\nthat the tidal influence of a close (<40 AU) binary companion significantly\nhastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as ~2/3 of all close\nbinaries promptly disperse their disks within <1 Myr after formation. However,\nprompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries and\nsingle stars, with ~80%-90% retaining their disks for at least ~2--3 Myr (but\nrarely for more than ~5 Myr).

If core\naccretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants in\nclose binaries should be rare. Conversely, since almost all single stars have a\nsimilar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity\nin RV surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is\nvery well-matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the\ndisk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Our models suggest\nthe two long tails may be formed simultaneously from a single encounter between\nNGC 7319 and 7320c, resulting in a thinner and denser inner tail than the outer\none.

The model\nresults support the ideas that the group-wide shock detected in\nmulti-wavelength observations between NGC 7319 and 7318b and the starburst\nregion north of NGC 7318b are triggered by the high-speed collision between NGC\n7318b and the intergalactic gas.

Our approach is based on data augmentation, and appeals heavily to a\nnovel class of Polya-Gamma distributions. Our main contributions are to build\nup the relevant distributional theory and to demonstrate three useful features\nof this data-augmentation scheme. First, it leads to simple EM and\nGibbs-sampling algorithms for posterior inference, circumventing the need for\nanalytic approximations, numerical integration, Metropolis--Hastings, or\nvariational methods. Second, it allows modelers much more flexibility when\nchoosing priors, which have traditionally come from the Dirichlet or\nlogistic-normal family. For example, our approach allows users to incorporate\nBayesian analogues of classical penalized-likelihood techniques (e.g. the lasso\nor bridge) in computing regularized estimates for log-odds ratios. Finally, our\ndata-augmentation scheme naturally suggests a default strategy for prior\nselection based on the logistic-Z model, which is strongly related to Jeffreys'\nprior for a binomial proportion.

All six are in binary systems with\napproximately circular orbits and are likely to have white dwarf companions.\nPSR J1017-7156 has a high flux density and a narrow pulse width, making it\nideal for precision timing experiments. PSRs J1446-4701 and J1125-5825 are\ncoincident with gamma-ray sources, and folding the high-energy photons with the\nradio timing ephemeris shows evidence of pulsed gamma-ray emission. PSR\nJ1502-6752 has a spin period of 26.7 ms, and its low period derivative implies\nthat it is a recycled pulsar. The orbital parameters indicate it has a very low\nmass function, and therefore a companion mass much lower than usually expected\nfor such a mildly recycled pulsar. In addition we present polarisation profiles\nfor all 12 MSPs discovered in the HTRU survey to date. Similar to previous\nobservations of MSPs, we find that many have large widths and a wide range of\nlinear and circular polarisation fractions. Their polarisation profiles can be\nhighly complex, and although the observed position angles often do not obey the\nrotating vector model, we present several examples of those that do. We\nspeculate that the emission heights of MSPs are a substantial fraction of the\nlight cylinder radius in order to explain broad emission profiles, which then\nnaturally leads to a large number of cases where emission from both poles is\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 00:21:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2011 05:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

This\npaper addresses the intrinsic incentive problems residing in social networks\nusing a game-theoretic model where individual users selfishly trade off the\ncosts of forming links (i.e. whom they interact with) and producing contents\npersonally against the potential rewards from doing so. Departing from the\nassumption that contents produced by difference users is perfectly\nsubstitutable, we explicitly consider heterogeneity in user-generated contents\nand study how it influences users' behavior and the structure of social\nnetworks. Given content heterogeneity, we rigorously prove that when the\npopulation of a social network is sufficiently large, every (strict)\nnon-cooperative equilibrium should consist of either a symmetric network\ntopology where each user produces the same amount of content and has the same\ndegree, or a two-level hierarchical topology with all users belonging to either\nof the two types: influencers who produce large amounts of contents and\nsubscribers who produce small amounts of contents and get most of their\ncontents from influencers. Meanwhile, the law of the few disappears in such\nnetworks. Moreover, we prove that the social optimum is always achieved by\nnetworks with symmetric topologies, where the sum of users' utilities is\nmaximized. To provide users with incentives for producing and mutually sharing\nthe socially optimal amount of contents, a pricing scheme is proposed, with\nwhich we show that the social optimum can be achieved as a non-cooperative\nequilibrium with the pricing of content acquisition and link formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 03:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}

Composite spectra were constructed for the full sample\nand several subsamples, chosen on the basis of absorber and QSO properties.\nAverage extinction curves were obtained for the samples by comparing their\ngeometric mean composite spectra with those of two samples of QSOs, matching in\nz$_{em}$ and i magnitude with the DLA sample, one sample without any absorbers\nalong their lines of sight and the other without any DLAs along their lines of\nsight irrespective of the presence of other absorption systems.

We have modeled the RCs\nof galaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) with the Einasto halo\nmodel, which has emerged as the best-fitting model of the halos arising in\ndissipationless cosmological N-body simulations. We find that the RCs are\nsignificantly better fit with the Einasto halo than with either a\npseudo-isothermal sphere (Iso) or Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo models. In our\nbest-fit models, the radius of density slope -2 and the density at this radius\nare highly correlated. The Einasto index, which controls the overall shape of\nthe density profile, is near unity on average for intermediate and low mass\nhalos. This is not in agreement with the predictions from LCDM simulations. The\nindices of the most massive halos are in rough agreement with those of\ncosmological simulations and appear correlated with the halo virial mass. We\nfind that a typical Einasto density profile declines more strongly in its\noutermost parts than any of the Iso or NFW models whereas it is relatively\nshallow in its innermost regions. The core nature of those regions of halos\nthus extends the cusp-core controversy found for the NFW model with low surface\ndensity galaxies to the Einasto halo with more massive galaxies like those of\nTHINGS.

We investigate this question here,\ndefining a complicated game as one with many possible moves, and therefore many\npossible payoffs conditional on those moves. We investigate two-person games in\nwhich the players learn based on experience. By generating games at random we\nshow that under some circumstances the strategies of the two players converge\nto fixed points, but under others they follow limit cycles or chaotic\nattractors. The dimension of the chaotic attractors can be very high, implying\nthat the dynamics of the strategies are effectively random. In the chaotic\nregime the payoffs fluctuate intermittently, showing bursts of rapid change\npunctuated by periods of quiescence, similar to what is observed in fluid\nturbulence and financial markets. Our results suggest that such intermittency\nis a highly generic phenomenon, and that there is a large parameter regime for\nwhich complicated strategic interactions generate inherently unpredictable\nbehavior that is best described in the language of dynamical systems theory\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 09:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-22"}

To explain the anomalies, others had proposed the\nrandom Rouse model (RRM) in which each monomer has different mobility taken\nfrom a broad log-normal distribution. Despite the success of the RRM, Diddens,\nBrodeck and Heuer [EPL, 95, 56003 (2011)] extracted the distribution of\nfriction coefficients from the MD simulations of a PEO/PMMA blend and found the\ndistribution is much narrower than expected from the RRM. We propose a simpler\nalternative explanation of the data by utilizing alone the observed crossover\nof PEO chain dynamics at tc. The present problem is just a special case of a\ngeneral property of relaxation in interacting systems, which is the crossover\nfrom independent relaxation to coupled many-body relaxation at some tc\ndetermined by the interaction potential. The generality is brought out vividly\nby pointing out that the crossover also had been observed by neutron scattering\nfrom entangled chains relaxation in monodisperse homo-polymers, and from the\nsegmental \\alpha-relaxation of PEO in blends with PMMA. The properties of all\nthe relaxation processes in connection with the crossover are similar, despite\nthe length-scales of the relaxation in these systems are widely different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 11:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}

The plasma structure function is extracted from the\nretarded flavor current-current correlator. Our main aim here is to explore the\neffect of non-conformality on these physical quantities. As usual, our study is\nunder the supergravity approximation and the limit of large color number.\nAlthough the Sakai-Sugimoto model is non-conformal, which makes the\ncalculations more involved than the well-studied $\\mathcal {N}$=4 SYM case, the\nresult seems to indicate that the non-conformality has little essential effect\non the physical picture of the internal structure of holographic plasma, which\nis consistent with the intuition from the asymptotic freedom of QCD at high\nenergy. While the physical picture underlying our investigation is same as the\nDIS off the $\\mathcal {N}$=4 SYM plasma with(out) flavor, the plasma structure\nfunctions are quantitatively different, especially their scaling dependence on\nthe temperature, which can be recognized as model-dependent. As a comparison,\nwe also do the same analysis for the non-critical version of the Sakai-Sugimoto\nmodel which is conformal in the sense that it has a constant dilaton vacuum.\nThe result for this non-critical model is much similar to the conformal\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma.

Employing channel state information (CSI) at the\ntransmitter can improve the throughput of routing and medium access control\n(MAC) protocols for mobile ad hoc networks. Several routing algorithms in the\nliterature explicitly incorporate the fading signal strength into the routing\nmetric, thus selecting the routes with strong channel conditions. While these\nstudies show that adaptation to the time-variant channel gain is beneficial in\nMANETs, they do not address the effect of the outdated fading CSI at the\ntransmitter. For realistic mobile node speeds, the channel gain is rapidly\nvarying, and becomes quickly outdated due the feedback delay.

We analysed radio, NIR, optical, UV, X-ray and soft gamma-ray\nobservations. We studied the source evolution in detail by producing light\ncurves, hardness-intensity diagrams and spectra. We fitted the broadband data\nwith phenomenological, then physical, models to study the emission coming from\nthe distinct components. Based on the energy spectra, the source evolved from\nthe canonical hard state to the canonical soft state. The source showed X-ray\nspectral variations that were correlated with changes in radio, NIR and optical\nemission.

In this study, we extend our investigation to varying\ndomain sizes, increasing stratification and place the box at different\nlatitudes. The effect of the increasing box size is to increase the sizes of\nthe generated structures, so that the principal vortex always fills roughly\nhalf of the computational domain. The instability becomes stronger in the sense\nthat the temperature anomaly and change in the radial velocity are observed to\nbe enhanced. The model with the smallest box size is found to be stable against\nthe instability, suggesting that a sufficient scale separation between the\nconvective eddies and the scale of the domain is required for the instability\nto work. The instability can be seen upto the co-latitude of 30 degrees, above\nwhich value the flow becomes dominated by other types of mean flows.

The strands had various designs, specifically; (i)\nseveral chemical barriers were introduced, viz: Fe and Nb, (ii) the strands\nwere encased in various outer-sheath materials, viz.: monel, Cu+monel,\nmonel+glidcop, Nb+monel, (iii) the filament counts were varied (1, 18, and 36),\nand (iv) the final strand diameter was varied. In addition, for a subset of the\nstrand designs several B powder and C-dopant types were investigated.\nSpecifically, two types of amorphous B powder were used: (i) Moissan based\n\"Tangshan boron\" (ii) \"SMI-boron\" which is produced in a plasma torch by the\nreduction-by-hydrogen of BCl3. Two approaches to C doping were taken: (i)\n\"malic-acid treatment\" in which C is introduced into the B powder precursor by\nthe moderate temperature drying out a slurry of B mixed in with a\nmalic-acid-toluene solution (during which the malic acid decomposes leaving C\nas the only solid residue) before the Mg powder is mixed in; (ii) direct C\ndoping of the SMI-produced B by introducing a known percentage of CH4 into the\nplasma flame. Critical current densities, Jc, were measured on 1.5 m long\nsamples at 4.2 K in fields of up to 14 T; of all the strands measured, that\ndoped with SMI-C at a nominal 4 mol% C (in relation B) yielded the highest Jc\nvalues e.g 1.1x105 A/cm2 at 7 T, 4.5x104 at 10 T, and 2.2x104 A/cm2 at 12 T.\nThe n-values are given for all strands at 5 and 10 T, and for a certain set of\nstrands the magnetic field dependencies of the n-values and the influence of\nC-doping is presented. Finally we demonstrate that, over a wide range of B,\nlog(Jc) decreases linearly with B with a slope -{\\alpha} such that the Jc(B) of\nany strand can be parameterized in terms of {\\alpha} and its zero-field\nintercept Jc(B=0).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 15:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We find the constraints\non these parameters from the latest $H(z)$ and SNe Ia data. At 1$\\sigma$ level\nthe constraints from $H(z)$ data are obtained as $q=-0.18_{-0.12}^{+0.12}$ and\n$H_{0}=68.43_{-2.80}^{+2.84}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ while the constraints from\nthe SNe Ia data read as $q=-0.38_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ and\n$H_{0}=69.18_{-0.54}^{+0.55}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

The analysis reveals that the\nobservational data successfully describe the cosmic acceleration within the\nframework of power-law cosmology.
