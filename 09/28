The\naccretion flow thus depends on the geometry of the magnetic field. This paper\nextends previous work by constructing a collection of orthogonal coordinate\nsystems, including the corresponding differential operators, where one\ncoordinate traces the magnetic field lines. This formalism allows for an\n(essentially) analytic description of the geometry and the conditions required\nfor the flow to pass through sonic points. Using this approach, we revisit the\nproblem of magnetically controlled accretion flow in a dipole geometry, and\nthen generalize the treatment to consider magnetic fields with multiple\ncomponents, including dipole, octupole, and split monopole contributions. This\napproach can be generalized further to consider more complex magnetic field\nconfigurations. Observations indicate that accreting young stars have\nsubstantial dipole and octupole components, and that accretion flow is\ntransonic. If the effective equation of state for the fluid is too stiff, the\nflow cannot pass smoothly through the sonic points in steady state. For a\nmultipole field of order \\ell, we derive a constraint on the polytropic index,\nn>\\ell+3/2, required for steady transonic flow to reach free-fall velocities.\nFor octupole fields, inferred on surfaces of T Tauri stars, n>9/2, so that the\nflow must be close to isothermal. The inclusion of octupole field components\nproduces higher densities at the stellar surface and smaller hot spots, which\noccur at higher latitudes; the magnetic truncation radius is also modified.\nThis contribution thus increases our understanding of magnetically controlled\naccretion for young stellar objects and can be applied to a variety of\nadditional astrophysical problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 16:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

One\napproach to examining the interplay between these deterministic and stochastic\nforces is the construction and analysis of stochastic difference equations\n$X_{t+1}=F(X_t,\\xi_{t+1})$ where $X_t \\in \\R^k$ represents the state of the\npopulations and $\\xi_1,\\xi_2,...$ is a sequence of random variables\nrepresenting environmental stochasticity. In the analysis of these stochastic\nmodels, many theoretical population biologists are interested in whether the\nmodels are bounded and persistent. Here, boundedness asserts that\nasymptotically $X_t$ tends to remain in compact sets. In contrast, persistence\nrequires that $X_t$ tends to be \"repelled\" by some \"extinction set\" $S_0\\subset\n\\R^k$. Here, results on both of these proprieties are reviewed for single\nspecies, multiple species, and structured population models. The results are\nillustrated with applications to stochastic versions of the Hassell and Ricker\nsingle species models, Ricker, Beverton-Holt, lottery models of competition,\nand lottery models of rock-paper-scissor games. A variety of conjectures and\nsuggestions for future research are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 16:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

Vega is a special object in this context as\nspectroscopic and interferometric studies have shown that it is a rapid rotator\nseen nearly pole one, a rare orientation particularly interesting for seismic\nstudies. In this paper we present a first systematic search for pulsations in\nVega. The goal of the present work is to detect for the first time pulsations\nin a rapidly rotating star seen nearly pole-on. Vega was monitored in\nquasi-continuous high-resolution echelle spectroscopy. A total of 4478 spectra\nwere obtained within 3 individual runs in 2008, 2009 and 2010 at high\nresolution. This data set should represent the most extensive high S/N, high\nresolution quasi-continuous survey obtained on Vega as of today. Equivalent\nphotospheric absorption profiles were calculated for the stellar spectrum, but\nalso for the telluric lines acting as a radial velocity reference. Residual\nvelocities were analysed and periodic low amplitude variations, potentially\nindicative of stellar pulsations, detected. All three data sets revealed the\npresence of residual periodic variations: 5.32 and 9.19 c/d, (A approx 6 m/s)\nin 2008, 12.71 and 13.25 c/d, (A approx 8 m/s) in 2009 and 5.42 and 10.82 c/d,\n(A approx 3-4 m/s) in 2010. A Lomb-Scargle periodogram of each velocity bin of\nthe equivalent profile was performed for the 2010 run, not showing the presence\nof any higher order nrp mode. It is too early to conclude that the variations\nare due to stellar pulsations, and a confirmation of the detection with a\nhighly stable spectrograph is a necessary next step. If pulsations are\nconfirmed, their very small amplitudes show that the star would belong to a\ncategory of very \"quiet\" pulsators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 19:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We model clusters initially\nin cool collapse, in virial equilibrium and expanding, and place a 1\nJupiter-mass planet at either 5au or 30au from their host stars, with zero\neccentricity. We find that after 10Myr 10% of planets initially orbiting at\n30au have been liberated from their parent star and form a population of\nfree-floating planets. A small number of these planets are captured by other\nstars. A further 10% have their orbital eccentricity significantly altered. The\nchange in eccentricity is often accompanied by a change in orbital inclination\nwhich may lead to additional dynamical perturbations in planetary systems. The\nfraction of liberated and disrupted planetary systems is highest for subvirial\nclusters, but virial and supervirial clusters also dynamically process\nplanetary systems, due to interactions in the substructure. Of the planets that\nbecome free-floating, those that remain observationally associated with the\ncluster (within two half-mass radii of the cluster centre) have a similar\nvelocity distribution to the entire star cluster, irrespective of whether they\nwere on a 5au or a 30au orbit, with median velocities typically 1km/s.\nConversely, those planets that are no longer associated with the cluster have\nsimilar velocities to the non-associated stars if they were originally at 5au\n(9km/s), whereas planets originally at 30au have much lower velocities\n(3.8km/s) than the stars (10.8km/s). These findings highlight potential\npitfalls of concluding that (a) planets with similar velocities to the cluster\nstars represent the very low-mass end of the IMF, and (b) planets on the\nperiphery of a cluster with very different observed velocities form through\ndifferent mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Although it is NP-hard to find an optimal solution for an arbitrary\nnumber of sequences, due to the importance of this problem researchers are\ntrying to push the limits of exact algorithms further. Since MSA can be cast as\na classical path finding problem, it is attracting a growing number of AI\nresearchers interested in heuristic search algorithms as a challenge with\nactual practical relevance. In this paper, we first review two previous,\ncomplementary lines of research. Based on Hirschbergs algorithm, Dynamic\nProgramming needs O(kN^(k-1)) space to store both the search frontier and the\nnodes needed to reconstruct the solution path, for k sequences of length N.\nBest first search, on the other hand, has the advantage of bounding the search\nspace that has to be explored using a heuristic. However, it is necessary to\nmaintain all explored nodes up to the final solution in order to prevent the\nsearch from re-expanding them at higher cost. Earlier approaches to reduce the\nClosed list are either incompatible with pruning methods for the Open list, or\nmust retain at least the boundary of the Closed list. In this article, we\npresent an algorithm that attempts at combining the respective advantages; like\nA* it uses a heuristic for pruning the search space, but reduces both the\nmaximum Open and Closed size to O(kN^(k-1)), as in Dynamic Programming. The\nunderlying idea is to conduct a series of searches with successively increasing\nupper bounds, but using the DP ordering as the key for the Open priority queue.\nWith a suitable choice of thresholds, in practice, a running time below four\ntimes that of A* can be expected. In our experiments we show that our algorithm\noutperforms one of the currently most successful algorithms for optimal\nmultiple sequence alignments, Partial Expansion A*, both in time and memory.\nMoreover, we apply a refined heuristic based on optimal alignments not only of\npairs of sequences, but of larger subsets. This idea is not new; however, to\nmake it practically relevant we show that it is equally important to bound the\nheuristic computation appropriately, or the overhead can obliterate any\npossible gain. Furthermore, we discuss a number of improvements in time and\nspace efficiency with regard to practical implementations. Our algorithm, used\nin conjunction with higher-dimensional heuristics, is able to calculate for the\nfirst time the optimal alignment for almost all of the problems in Reference 1\nof the benchmark database BAliBASE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 20:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-29"}

The first part of the paper adopts the terminology of motion\ndescription languages and deconstructs an elementary form of the well-known\npopular dance, Salsa, in terms of four motion primitives (dance steps). Several\nnotions of dance complexity are introduced. We describe an experiment in which\nten performances by an actual pair of dancers are evaluated by judges and then\ncompared in terms of proposed complexity metrics. An energy metric is also\ndefined. Values of this metric are obtained by summing the lengths of motion\nsegments executed by wheeled robots replicating the movements of the human\ndancers in each of the ten dance performances. Of all the metrics that are\nconsidered in this experiment, energy is the most closely correlated with the\nhuman judges' assessments of performance quality.\n  The second part of the paper poses a general class of dual objective motion\ncontrol problems in which a primary objective (artistic execution of a dance\nstep or efficient movement toward a specified terminal state) is combined with\na communication objective. Solutions of varying degrees of explicitness can be\ngiven in several classes of problems of communicating through the dynamics of\nfinite dimensional linear control systems. In this setting it is shown that the\ncost of adding a communication component to motions that steer a system between\nprescribed pairs of states is independent of those states.

As most candidate\nprocesses ultimately depend on host halo mass, accurate characterizations of\nthe local environment, ideally tied to halo mass estimates and spanning a range\nin halo mass and redshift are needed. In this work, we present and test a\nrigorous, probabalistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based on\nprecise photometric redshifts and X-ray selected groups drawn from the COSMOS\nfield. The groups have masses in the range 10^13 < M_200c/M_sun < 10^14 and\nspan redshifts 0<z<1. We characterize our selection algorithm via tests on\nspectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the VLT, and by\napplying our method to detailed mock catalogs. We find that our group member\ngalaxy sample has a purity of 84% and completeness of 92% within 0.5 R200c. We\nmeasure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on the\nquality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as well\nas future imaging and spectroscopic surveys. As a first application of our new\ngroup member catalog which will be made publicly available, we show that member\ngalaxies exhibit a higher quenched fraction compared to the field at fixed\nstellar mass out to z~1, indicating a significant relationship between star\nformation and environment at group scales. We also address the suggestion that\ndusty star forming galaxies in such groups may impact the high-l power spectrum\nof the cosmic microwave background and find that such a population cannot\nexplain the low power seen in recent SZ measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 21:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We employ the scattering matrix approach to quantum\ntransport to develop a unified theory of nanoelectromechanical systems out of\nequilibrium.

It\ncan deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the\npropositional fragment of PDDL2.2, including advanced features like ADL\nconditions and effects and derived predicates (axioms). Like other well-known\nplanners such as HSP and FF, Fast Downward is a progression planner, searching\nthe space of world states of a planning task in the forward direction. However,\nunlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast Downward does not use the\npropositional PDDL representation of a planning task directly. Instead, the\ninput is first translated into an alternative representation called\nmulti-valued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints of a\npropositional planning task explicit. Exploiting this alternative\nrepresentation, Fast Downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning\ntasks for computing its heuristic function, called the causal graph heuristic,\nwhich is very different from traditional HSP-like heuristics based on ignoring\nnegative interactions of operators.\n  In this article, we give a full account of Fast Downwards approach to solving\nmulti-valued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal\ngraph heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present\nsome novel techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downwards\nbest-first search algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful\nactions from local search to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of\nheuristic functions mitigates the negative effect of large branching factors on\nsearch performance, and multi-heuristic best-first search combines several\nheuristic evaluation functions within a single search algorithm in an\northogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures for fast state\nexpansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present a new\nnon-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search,\nwhich utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way.\n  Fast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the \"classical (i.e.,\npropositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning\nCompetition at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF\nand LPG. Our experiments show that it also performs very well on the benchmarks\nof the earlier planning competitions and provide some insights about the\nusefulness of the new search enhancements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 22:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-29"}

Simulated CMB maps with\nassigned type and amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity are important tools\nto determine the strength, sensitivity and limitations of non-Gaussian\nestimators. Here we investigate whether and to what extent our non-Gaussian\nindicators have sensitivity to detect non-Gaussianity of local type,\nparticularly with amplitude within the seven-year WMAP bounds. We make a\nsystematic study by employing our statistical tools to generate maps of\nskewness and kurtosis from several thousands of simulated maps equipped with\nnon-Gaussianity of local type of various amplitudes. We show that our\nindicators can be used to detect large-angle local-type non-Gaussianity only\nfor relatively large values of the non-linear parameter $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm\nlocal}$. Thus, our indicators have not enough sensitivity to detect deviation\nfrom Gaussianity with the non-linear parameter within the seven-year WMAP\nbounds. This result along with the outcomes of frequency bands and\nforeground-reduced analyses suggest that non-Gaussianity captured in the\nprevious works by our indicators is not of primordial origin, although it might\nhave a primordial component. We have also made a comparative study of\nnon-Gaussianity of simulated maps and of the full-sky WMAP foreground-reduced\nseven-year ILC-7yr map.

The second \"Local\" refers\nto the cyclic homology localised to a certain separable subring of the ground\nalgebra, while the last one refers to Alexander-Spanier type cyclic homology.\nThe Connes-Moscovici work is based on the operator $R(A) = \\mathbf{P} -\n\\mathbf{e}$ associated to the elliptic pseudo-differential operator $A$ on the\nsmooth manifold $M$, where $\\mathbf{P}$, $\\mathbf{e}$ are idempotents, see\n\\cite{Connes-Moscovici1}, Pg. 353. The operator $R(A)$ has two main merits: it\nis a smoothing operator and its distributional kernel is situated in an\narbitrarily small neighbourhood of the diagonal in $M \\times M$. The operator\n$R(A)$ has also two setbacks: -i) it is not an idempotent (and therefore it\ndoes not have a genuine Connes-Chern character); -ii) even if it were an\nidempotent, its Connes-Chern character would belong to the cyclic homology of\nthe algebra of smoothing operators (with \\emph{arbitrary} supports, which is\n\\emph{trivial}. This paper presents a new solution to the difficulties raised\nby the two setbacks. For which concerns -i), we show that although $R(A)$ is\nnot an idempotent, it satisfies the identity $ (\\mathbf{R}(A))^{2} \\;=\\;\n\\mathbf{R}(A) - [\\mathbf{R}(A) . e + e .\\mathbf{R}(A) ]. $ We show that the\noperator $R(A)$ has a genuine Chern character provided the cyclic homology\ncomplex of the algebra of smoothing operators is \\emph{localised} to the\nseparable sub-algebra $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{C} + \\mathbb{C} . e$, see Sect. 8.1.\nFor which concerns -ii), we introduce the notion of \\emph{local} cyclic\nhomology; this is constructed on the foot-steps of the Alexander-Spanier\nhomology, i.e. by filtering the chains of the cyclic homology complex of the\nalgebra of smoothing operators by their distributional support, see Sect. 7.\nUsing these new instruments, we give a reformulation of the Connes-Moscovici\nlocal Index Theorem, see Theorem 23, Sect. 9. As a corollary of this theorem,\nwe show that the \\emph{local} cyclic homology of the algebra of smoothing\noperators is at least as big as the Alexander-Spanier homology of the base\nmanifold. The present reformulation of Connes-Moscovici local index theorem\nopens the way to new investigations, see Sect. 10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 04:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-29"}

The present work exploits the\n6.7 GHz maser data collected so far to investigate the milliarcsecond structure\nof this maser emission at high-velocity resolution. Most of the detected 6.7\nGHz maser features present an ordered (linear, or arc-like) distribution of\nmaser spots on the plane of the sky, together with a regular variation in the\nspot LSR velocity (V_LSR) with position. Typical values for the amplitude of\nthe V_LSR gradients (defined in terms of the derivative of the spot V_LSR with\nposition) are found to be 0.1-0.2 km s^(-1) mas^(-1). In each of the four\ntarget sources, the orientation and the amplitude of most of the feature V_LSR\ngradients remain remarkably stable in time, on timescales of (at least) several\nyears. We also find that the data are consistent with having the V_LSR\ngradients and proper motion vectors in the same direction on the sky,\nconsidered the measurement uncertainties. The time persistency, the ordered\nangular and spatial distribution, and the orientation generally similar to the\nproper motions, altogether suggest a kinematical interpretation for the origin\nof the 6.7 GHz maser V_LSR gradients.

This limit is vastly different from the planar limit,\nand hence from the gauge theory point of view the duality is more difficult to\nexplain compared to the previously known analogous equivalence between planar\ngauge theories, where one can explicitly prove the equivalence diagrammatically\nusing the dominance of the planar diagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 08:54:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2012 08:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We\nbriefly discuss the mass loss by stellar winds, which are influenced by the\nanisotropic temperature distribution. These anisotropies in the interior are\nalso driving circulation currents, which transports the chemical elements and\nthe angular momentum in stars. Internal differential rotation, if present,\ncreates instabilities and mixing, in particular the shear mixing, the\nhorizontal turbulence and their interactions. A major check of the model\npredictions concerns the changes of the surface abundances, which are modified\nby mass loss in the very massive stars and by rotational mixing in O- and\nB-type stars. We show that the observations confirm the existence of rotational\nmixing, with much larger effects at lower metallicities.

Former observation of three transition\ndiscs LkHa330, SR21N, and HD1353444B at submillimetre wavelengths revealed\nimages which cannot be modelled by a simple axisymmetric disc. We show that a\nlarge-scale anticyclonic vortex that develops where the viscosity has a large\ngradient (e.g., at the edge of the disc dead zone), might be accountable for\nthese large-scale asymmetries. We modelled the long-term evolution of vortices\nbeing triggered by the Rossby wave instability. We found that a\nhorseshoe-shaped (azimuthal wavenumber m=1) large-scale vortex forms by\ncoalescing of smaller vortices within 5x10^4 yr, and can survive on the disc\nlife-time (~5x10^6 yr), depending on the magnitude of global viscosity and the\nthickness of the viscosity gradient. The two-dimensional grid-based global disc\nsimulations with local isothermal approximation and compressible-gas model have\nbeen done by the GPU version of hydrodynamic code FARGO (GFARGO). To calculate\nthe dust continuum image at submillimetre wavelengths, we combined our\nhydrodynamical results with a 3D radiative transfer code. By the striking\nsimilarities of the calculated and observed submillimetre images, we suggest\nthat the three transition discs can be modelled by a disc possessing a\nlarge-scale vortex formed near the disc dead zone edge. Since the larger dust\ngrains (larger than mm in size) are collected in these vortices, the\nnon-axisymmetric submillimetre images of the above transition discs might be\ninterpreted as active planet and planetesimal forming regions situated far (>\n50 AU) from the central stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 11:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 08:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We considered the spectra of nearby (z<0.1)\ngalaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The equivalent width (EW)\ndistribution of the [O III]5007 emission line is strongly clustered around ~0.6\nA, extending the validity of the results we obtained for red giant ellipticals.\nThe close connection between emission lines and stellar continuum points to\nstellar processes as the most likely source of the bulk of the ionizing photons\nin these galaxies although their emission line ratios are similar to those of\nactive nuclei. Genuine AGN might be sought mainly among the minority (~5-10%)\nof outliers, i.e., galaxies with EW>~2 A. The galaxies located in the AGN\nregion of the spectroscopic diagnostic diagrams outnumber outliers by a factor\n5-10 which casts doubts on the accuracy of the current identification of active\ngalaxies, particularly those of LINERs of low line luminosity, <~ 10^39-10^40\nerg/s. This conclusion can be tested by using spectra that covers smaller\nphysical regions such as those that are already available in the literature of\nthe ~500 nearest bright galaxies, with a stellar continuum reduced by a factor\nof 20-100 with respect to SDSS galaxies. If the emission lines were mainly of\nAGN origin, their contrast against the continuum should be enhanced. Instead,\ntheir EW distribution is similar to that of the SDSS sample, with just an\nincrease of the outlier fraction. We conclude that the number low-luminosity\nAGN is currently largely overestimated with a sample purity as low as ~10%. As\na consequence the properties of low-luminosity AGN should be fundamentally\nrevised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 13:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Here, we identify the type\nof such synchronisation and explore systematically its uniqueness and\nrobustness using a simple paleoclimate model akin to the van der Pol relaxation\noscillator and dynamical system theory. As the insolation is quite a complex\nquasiperiodic signal involving different frequencies, the traditional concepts\nused to define synchronisation to periodic forcing are no longer applicable.\nInstead, we explore a different concept of generalised synchronisation in terms\nof (coexisting) synchronised solutions for the forced system, their basins of\nattraction and instabilities. We propose a clustering technique to compute the\nnumber of synchronised solutions, each of which corresponds to a different\npaleoclimate history. In this way, we uncover multistable synchronisation\n(reminiscent of phase- or frequency-locking to individual periodic components\nof astronomical forcing) at low forcing strength, and monostable or unique\nsynchronisation at stronger forcing. In the multistable regime, different\ninitial conditions may lead to different paleoclimate histories. To study their\nrobustness, we analyse Lyapunov exponents that quantify the rate of convergence\ntowards each synchronised solution (local stability), and basins of attraction\nthat indicate critical levels of external perturbations (global stability).

Most of previous works in\nthe literature have mainly focused on the sparse synthesis prior where the\nsparsity is measured as the L1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the\nsignal from a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis\nregularization minimizes the L1 norm of the correlations between the signal and\nthe atoms in the dictionary, where these correlations define the analysis\nsupport. The corresponding variational problem encompasses several well-known\nregularizations such as the discrete total variation and the Fused Lasso. Our\nmain contributions consist in deriving sufficient conditions that guarantee\nexact or partial analysis support recovery of the true signal in presence of\nnoise. More precisely, we give a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal\nis the unique solution of the L1-analysis regularization in the noiseless case.\nThe same condition also guarantees exact analysis support recovery and\nL2-robustness of the L1-analysis minimizer vis-a-vis an enough small noise in\nthe measurements. This condition turns to be sharp for the robustness of the\nanalysis support. To show partial support recovery and L2-robustness to an\narbitrary bounded noise, we introduce a stronger sufficient condition. When\nspecialized to the L1-synthesis regularization, our results recover some\ncorresponding recovery and robustness guarantees previously known in the\nliterature. From this perspective, our work is a generalization of these\nresults. We finally illustrate these theoretical findings on several examples\nto study the robustness of the 1-D total variation and Fused Lasso\nregularizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 14:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 07:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 12:48:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 20:31:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 13:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-03"}

There are many factors that can influence each step of\nthe calculation, such as the dust and host galaxy contribution to the observed\nluminosity, the black hole mass and more importantly, the uncertainties on the\nbolometric luminosity measurement. Ideally, we would measure the AGN emission\nat every wavelength, remove the host galaxy and dust, reconstruct the AGN\nspectral energy distribution and integrate to determine the intrinsic emission\nand the accretion rate. In reality, this is not possible due to observational\nlimitations and our own galaxy line of sight obscuration. We have then to infer\nthe bolometric luminosity from spectral measurements made in discontinuous\nwavebands and at different epochs. In this paper we tackle this issue by\nexploring different methods to determine the bolometric luminosity. We first\nexplore the trend of accretion efficiency with black hole mass (efficiency\nproportional to M^{\\sim 0.5}) found in recent work by Davis & Laor and discuss\nwhy this is most likely an artefact of the parameter space covered by their PG\nquasar sample. We then target small samples of AGN at different redshifts,\nluminosities and black hole masses to investigate the possible methods to\ncalculate the accretion efficiency. For these sources we are able to determine\nthe mass accretion rate and, with some assumptions, the accretion efficiency\ndistributions. Even though we select the sources for which we are able to\ndetermine the parameters more accurately, there are still factors affecting the\nmeasurements that are hard to constrain. We suggest methods to overcome these\nproblems based on contemporaneous multi-wavelength data measurements and\nspecifically targeted observations for AGN in different black hole mass ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 14:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Its characteristic length lambda should not be\nsmaller than one Earth's radius R_e, while its upper bound is expected to be\nslightly smaller than the Earth-Moon distance (60 R_e).

For a suitable choice\nof sets of parameters, the behavior of the singularity, horizon, mass function,\nblack hole mass, temperature, entropy and its differential, area and energy\ndistribution of the Bardeen solution have been discussed graphically for both\nnoncommutative and commutative spaces. Graphs show that the commutative\ncoordinates extrapolate all such quantities (except temperature) for a given\nset of parameters. It is interesting to mention here that these sets of\nparameters provide the singularity (essential for $r_h>0$) and horizon\n($f(r_h)=0$ for $r_h>0$) for the black hole solution in noncommutative space,\nwhile for commutative space no such quantity exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 07:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}
