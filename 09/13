The analysis relies on a semi-analytic model, which permits the\nconstruction of a MW progenitor sample by backtracking the cosmic history of\nall simulated present-day galaxies similar to the real MW. Results: (i) ALMA\ncan best observe a MW at z=3 by looking at CO(3-2) emission. The probability of\ndetecting a random model MW at 3-sigma in 24 h using 75 km/s channels is\nroughly 50%, and these odds can be increased by co-adding the CO(3-2) and\nCO(4-3) lines.

(ii) Higher CO transitions\ncontained in the ALMA bands geq6 will be invisible, unless the considered MW\nprogenitor coincidentally hosts a major starburst or an active black hole.\n(iii) The high-frequency array of SKA, fitted with 28.8 GHz receivers, would be\na powerful instrument for observing CO(1-0) at z=3, able to detect nearly all\nsimulated MWs in 24 h. (iv) HI detections in MWs at z=3 using the low-frequency\narray of SKA will be impossible in any reasonable observing time.

Our analysis was motivated by long-studied volume phase transitions\nvia ion exchange in ionic gels, but our findings agree with existing theory for\nvolume-temperature phase transitions in charged hard-sphere models and other\nsystems by Fisher and Levin, and McGahay and Tomozawa.

Recently, the\nfinite element method was shown to be a powerful numerical method for ab initio\nelectronic structure calculations with a variable real-space resolution. In\nthis work, we demonstrate how to obtain quantum critical parameters by\ncombining the finite element method (FEM) with finite size scaling (FSS) using\ndifferent ab initio approximations and exact formulations. The critical\nparameters could be atomic nuclear charges, internuclear distances, electron\ndensity, disorder, lattice structure, and external fields for stability of\natomic, molecular systems and quantum phase transitions of extended systems. To\nillustrate the effectiveness of this approach we provide detailed calculations\nof applying FEM to approximate solutions for the two-electron atom with varying\nnuclear charge; these include Hartree-Fock, density functional theory under the\nlocal density approximation, and an \"exact\"' formulation using FEM. We then use\nthe FSS approach to determine its critical nuclear charge for stability; here,\nthe size of the system is related to the number of elements used in the\ncalculations. Results prove to be in good agreement with previous Slater-basis\nset calculations and demonstrate that it is possible to combine finite size\nscaling with the finite-element method by using ab initio calculations to\nobtain quantum critical parameters.

Additional observations are required to confirm or exclude\ntransits of HD 97658b.\n  We present evidence for photometric transits of the low-mass planet HD 97658b\nacross the disk of its host star, an early K dwarf. This planet was previously\ndiscovered in radial velocities (RVs) from Keck/HIRES as part of the Eta-Earth\nSurvey. Using photometry from the Automated Photometric Telescopes at Fairborn\nObservatory, we detected four separate planetary egress events at times\npredicted from the RV orbit. We measured a transit depth of 1470 +/- 260 ppm, a\nresult that should be confirmed and refined with space-based photometry. We\nalso collected additional Keck-HIRES RV measurements that refined the transit\nephemeris and planet mass. With an orbital period of 9.4957 +/- 0.0022 days, HD\n97658b is a close-in planet that had been classified as a `super-Earth' based\non its mass of 6.4 +/- 0.7 Mearth. However, the planet radius of 2.93 +/- 0.28\nRearth implies a density of 1.40 g/cc and suggests `sub-Neptune' status. The\nlow density can be explained by an extended atmosphere of volatiles such as\nhydrogen, helium, and water. HD 97658b is similar to GJ 1214b in mass, radius,\nand density, although HD 97658b has a higher equilibrium temperature of 510 -\n720 K. The star HD 97658 (V = 7.8, K = 5.7) is among the brightest known to\nhost a transiting planet, which will facilitate detailed follow-up\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 17:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 19:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-12"}

One example of the latter is the\nsubcortical network of the basal ganglia, formed by excitatory and inhibitory\nbursters of the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, involved in motor\ncontrol and affected in Parkinson's disease. Recent experiments have\ndemonstrated the intermittent nature of the phase-locking of neural activity in\nthis network. Here we explore one potential mechanism to explain the\nintermittent phase-locking in a network. We simplify the network to obtain a\nmodel of two inhibitory coupled elements and explore its dynamics. We used\ngeometric analysis and singular perturbation methods for dynamical systems to\nreduce the full model to a simpler set of equations. Mathematical analysis was\ncompleted using three slow variables with two different time scales.\nIntermittently synchronous oscillations are generated by overlapped spiking\nwhich crucially depends on the geometry of the slow phase plane and the\ninterplay between slow variables as well as the strength of synapses. Two slow\nvariables are responsible for the generation of activity patterns with\noverlapped spiking and the other slower variable enhances the robustness of an\nirregular and intermittent activity pattern. While the analyzed network and the\nexplored mechanism of intermittent synchrony appear to be quite generic, the\nresults of this analysis can be used to trace particular values of biophysical\nparameters (synaptic strength and parameters of calcium dynamics), which are\nknown to be impacted in Parkinson's disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 18:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}

In this discussion often concepts are used that originate in\nphilosophy and ask for a philosophical analysis. In the present work the\nclassic philosophical tradition based on Aristotle and Aquinas is employed\nwhich surprisingly is able to shed light on important aspects. Especially one\ncould mention the high degree of unity in living objects and the occurrence of\nthorough qualitative changes. The latter are outside the scope of classical\nphysics where changes are restricted to geometrical rearrangement of\nmicroscopic particles. A challenging approach is used in the philosophical\nanalysis as the empirical evidence is not taken from everyday life but from\n20th century science (quantum mechanics) and recent results in the field of\nquantum biology.

The aim of the present\npaper is to fill this gap by constructing near-explicit \"polar\" codes that are\ncapacity-achieving. The codes exploit the channel polarization phenomenon\nobserved by Arikan for the case of classical channels. Channel polarization is\nan effect in which one can synthesize a set of channels, by \"channel combining\"\nand \"channel splitting,\" in which a fraction of the synthesized channels are\nperfect for data transmission while the other fraction are completely useless\nfor data transmission, with the good fraction equal to the capacity of the\nchannel.

First, we leverage several known results from the\nquantum information literature to demonstrate that the channel polarization\neffect occurs for channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs.

Thus, dusty shells around hot stars trace the\nhistory of \"great\" eruptions, and the statistics of such shells in the Galaxy\nindicate that these eruptions are likely the dominant mass loss mechanism for\nevolved, M>40Msun stars.

The population of cluster ellipticals exhibit a marked bimodal\ndistribution as a function of galaxy stellar mass, with a dip at masses $\\sim\n10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. In the framework of our models, this bimodality\noriginates from the combination of a strongly decreasing number of galaxies\nwith increasing stellar mass, and a correspondingly increasing probability of\nexperiencing major mergers. We show that the correlation between the measured\nelliptical fraction and the assembly history of the parent cluster is weak, and\nthat it becomes stronger in models that adopt longer galaxy merger times. We\nargue that this results from the combined effect of a decreasing bulge\nproduction due to a reduced number of mergers, and an increasing survival\nprobability of pre-existing ellipticals, with the latter process being more\nimportant than the former.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 20:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The above has served as a valuable guide in aiding the understanding of\nboth simulated and observed galaxies, in spite of a number of caveats being\npresent. The observed spiral or bar patterns in real galaxies are frequently\nonly marginally consistent with the tight-winding assumption, often in fact,\noutright inconsistent. Here we derive a complementary formulation to the\nproblem, by treating quasi-radial density waves under simplified assumptions in\nthe linear regime. We assume that the potential due to the density wave is\napproximately tangential, and derive the corresponding dispersion relation of\nthe problem. We obtain an instability criterion for the onset of quasi-radial\ndensity waves, which allows a clear understanding of the increased stability of\nthe higher order modes, which appear at progressively larger radii, as often\nseen in real galaxies.

The\nexponential disc as traced by RGB stars dominates the SB profile out to >8 disc\nscale-lengths, or R_dp~18 kpc, and reaches a V-band SB of 29 mag per sq.\narcsec.

The primitives are\noptimized for small memory footprint while maintaining efficient performance in\nlow contention scenarios. A read-write lwlock occupies 4 bytes, a mutex\noccupies 4 bytes (2 if deadlock detection is not required), and a condition\nvariable occupies 4 bytes. The corresponding primitives of the popular pthread\nlibrary occupy 56 bytes, 40 bytes and 48 bytes respectively on the x86-64\nplatform. The API for lwlocks is similar to that of the pthread library but\ncovering only the most common use cases. Lwlocks allow explicit control of\nqueuing and scheduling decisions in contention situations and support\n\"asynchronous\" or \"deferred blocking\" acquisition of locks. Asynchronous\nlocking helps in working around the constraints of lock-ordering which\notherwise limits concurrency. The small footprint of lwlocks enables the\nconstruction of data structures with very fine-grained locking, which in turn\nis crucial for lowering contention and supporting highly concurrent access to a\ndata structure. Currently, the Data Domain File System uses lwlocks for its\nin-memory inode cache as well as in a generic doubly-linked concurrent list\nwhich forms the building block for more sophisticated structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 21:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-14"}

Earth-like habitable-zone (HZ) planets maintain stable surface\nliquid water over geological time. This requires equilibrium between the\ntemperature-dependent rate of greenhouse-gas consumption by weathering,and\ngreenhouse-gas resupply by other processes. Detected small-radius exoplanets,\nand anticipated M-dwarf HZ rocky planets, are expected to be tidally locked. We\ninvestigate two feedbacks that can destabilize climate on tidally-locked\nplanets. (1) If small changes in pressure alter the temperature distribution\nacross a planet's surface such that the weathering rate increases when the\npressure decreases, a positive feedback occurs involving increasing weathering\nrate near the substellar point, decreasing pressure, and increasing substellar\nsurface temperature. (2) When decreases in pressure increase the surface area\nabove the melting point (through reduced advective cooling of the substellar\npoint), and the corresponding increase in volume of liquid causes net\ndissolution of the atmosphere, a further decrease in pressure occurs. We use an\nidealized energy balance model to map out the conditions under which these\ninstabilities may occur. The weathering runaway can shrink the habitable zone,\nand cause geologically rapid 10^3-fold pressure shifts within the HZ. Mars may\nhave undergone a weathering runaway in the past. Substellar dissolution is\nusually a negative feedback or weak positive feedback on changes in pressure.\nBoth instabilities are suppressed if the atmosphere has a high radiative\nefficiency. Our results are most relevant for atmospheres that are thin and\nhave low greenhouse-gas radiative efficiency. These results identify a new\npathway by which HZ planets can undergo rapid climate shifts and become\nuninhabitable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 02:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Quantifying this relationship is important\nbecause the degree to which a halo is dynamically equilibrated will influence\nthe reliability with which we can measure characteristic equilibrium properties\nof the structure and kinematics of a population of haloes. We begin by\nverifying that a halo's formation redshift zform correlates with its virial\nmass Mvir and we show that the fraction of its recently accreted mass and the\nlikelihood of it having experienced a recent major merger increases with\nincreasing Mvir and decreasing zform. We then show that both eta and Delta r\nincrease with increasing Mvir and decreasing zform, which implies that massive\nrecently formed haloes are more likely to be dynamically unrelaxed than their\nless massive and older counterparts. Our analysis shows that both eta and Delta\nr are good indicators of a halo's dynamical state, showing strong positive\ncorrelations with recent mass accretion and merging activity, but we argue that\nDelta r provides a more robust and better defined measure of dynamical state\nfor use in cosmological N-body simulations at z~0.

The paramagnetic phase has also been investigated using\nLDA+Gutzwiller method with electron density self-consistency. The\nrenormalization factors for the correlated Mn 3d orbitals in the paramagnetic\nphase of BaMn_{2}As_{2} are shown to be generally smaller than those of\nBaFe_{2}As_{2}, which indicates that BaMn_{2}As_{2} has stronger electron\ncorrelation effect than BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The screening effect of the main As 4p\nelectrons to the correlated Fe/Mn 3d electrons is evident by the systematic\nshift of the results to larger Hund's rule coupling J side from the ddp-model\ncompared with those from the d-model. A gradual transition from paramagnetic\nstate to the antiferromagnetic ground state with increasing J is obtained for\nthe models of BaFe_{2}As_{2} which has a small experimental magnetic moment;\nwhile a rather sharp jump occurs for the models of BaMn_{2}As_{2}, which has a\nlarge experimental magnetic moment.

We find that the chemical composition of the\ninterstellar grain mantle is highly dependent on the physical parameters\nassociated with a molecular cloud. Interstellar photons are seen to play an\nimportant role towards the growth and the structure of the interstellar grain\nmantle. We consider the effects of interstellar photons (photo-dissociation and\nphoto-evaporation) in our simulation under various interstellar conditions. We\nnotice that the effects of interstellar photons dominate around the region of\nlower visual extinction. These photons contribute significantly in the\nformation of the grain mantle. Energy of the incoming photon is attenuated by\nthe absorption and scattering by the interstellar dust. Top most layers are\nmainly assumed to be affected by the incoming radiation.

Its high observed frequencies, i.e., between 59.9c/d\n(693.9 microHz) and 71.1c/d (822.8microHz), suggest higher radial orders.

The results from the MOST observing runs in 2009\nand 2010 were compared to each other. The resulting frequencies were submitted\nto asteroseismic analysis. HD 144277 was discovered to be a delta Scuti star\nusing the time-series photometry observed by the MOST satellite. Twelve\nindependent pulsation frequencies lying in four distinct groups were\nidentified. Two additional frequencies were found to be combination\nfrequencies. The typical spacing of 3.6c/d corresponds to the spacing between\nsubsequent radial and dipole modes, therefore the spacing between radial modes\nis twice this value, 7.2c/d. Based on the assumption of slow rotation, we find\nevidence that the two radial modes are the sixth and seventh overtones, and the\nfrequency with the highest amplitude can be identified as a dipole mode.

Contrary to\nother colours in the optical and near-infrared, we find that the colours become\nbluer for larger galaxies. The relations are tighter when using the colour\ninside r_e, rather than the much smaller r_e/8 aperture, due to the presence of\nyoung populations in the central regions.

Comparing our data with the models of Marigo et al., which show that\nmore metal rich galaxies are bluer, we can explain our results in a way\nconsistent with results from the optical, by stating that larger galaxies are\nmore metal rich. The blueing is caused by a strong CO absorption band, whose\nline strength increases strongly with decreasing temperature and which covers a\nconsiderable fraction of the 4.5 micron filter. In galaxies that contain a\ncompact radio source, the [3.6]-[4.5] colour is generally slightly redder than\nin the other galaxies, indicating small amounts of either hot dust, non-thermal\nemission, or young stars near the center.\n  We find that the large majority of the galaxies show redder colours with\nincreasing radius. abbreviated...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In this article, we simulate\nand discuss the AC loss due to an applied magnetic field making an arbitrary\nangle with the cable and taking into account a realistic anisotropic field\ndependence of the critical current density. We study the AC loss in the\nsuperconductor parts for the limits of very high coupling currents and\ncompletely uncoupled strands. The simulations for the uncoupled case also\ndescribe a double pancake coil with no transport current. For the simulations,\nwe use two different numerical methods with complementary strengths.

Opposite than expected, we found that the AC loss does not\nonly depend on the perpendicular component of the applied magnetic field. We\nalso found that the AC loss for applied fields with an orientation below 7\ndegrees with the strands surface is reduced more than one order of magnitude\ncomparing to an untransposed cable.

However, numerous data from space and balloon-born missions and\nrecently from Herschel and Planck show that dust emission is not well\nunderstood, as revealed by the observed anti-correlation of beta with the grain\ntemperature. In order to give astronomers the necessary data to interpret\nFIR/submm observations, we synthesised analogues of interstellar amorphous and\ncrystalline silicate grains, rich in Mg and Ca, and having stiochiometry of\nolivine and pyroxene and measured their MAC, in the 100-1000/1500 \\mum range\nfor grain temperatures varying from 300 to 10 K. We find that the grain MAC\ndecreases when the grain temperature decreases and that the local spectral\nindex, beta, defined as the slope of the MAC curve, is anti-correlated with the\ngrain temperature. These variations, which are not observed in the crystallised\nsamples, are related to the amorphous nature of the samples. In addition, the\nspectral shape of the MAC is complex: at short wavelengths (lambda < 500/700\n\\mum), beta is in the range 1.6 - 2.1 for all grain temperature and grain\ncomposition whereas at longer wavelengths (lambda > 500/700 \\mum), beta < 2 for\nsamples with a pyroxene stoichiometry and beta > 2 for samples with an olivine\nstoichiometry. Hence, the simplifying asymptotic expression based on a single\ntemperature- and wavelength-independent spectral index used by astronomers is\nnot appropriate to describe the dust MAC and thus the dust emission, and may\ninduce significant errors on the derived parameters such as the dust mass and\nthe dust physical and chemical properties. Instead, dust emission models should\nuse the dust MAC as a function of wavelength and temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 12:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In photothermal\nsingle (nano-)particle microscopy, however, a complicated, though\nprediction-wise limited, electrodynamic (EM) scattering treatment was\nestablished [3] during the emergence of this new technique. Our recent study\nextended [4] this EM-approach into a full ab-initio model describing the\nreality of the situation encountered and showed for the first time that the\nmechanism behind the signal, despite its nanoscopic origin, is also the\nlens-like action of the induced refractive index profile only hidden in the\ncomplicated guise of the theoretical Mie-like framework. The diffraction model\nproposed here yields succinct analytical expressions for the axial PT signal\nshape and magnitude and its angular distribution, all showing the clear\nlens-signature. It is further demonstrated, that the Gouy-phase of a Gaussian\nbeam does not contribute to the relative photothermal signal in forward\ndirection, a fact which is not easily evident from the more rigorous EM\ntreatment. The model may thus be used to estimate the signal shape and\nmagnitude in photothermal single particle microscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 13:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-14"}

A constraint that each message must be kept confidential from the\nunintended receiver constitutes the second class. For both classes, the\nconditional distribution characterizing the channel depends on a state process\nand the encoder has side-information provided to it in a noncausal manner. For\nthe first class of channels, an outer bound is derived employing techniques\nused to prove the converse theorem for the Gel'fand-Pinsker's channel with\nrandom parameters; the bounds are tight for individual rate constraints, but\ncan be improved upon for the sum rate. The technique for deriving outer bounds\nfor the second class of channels hinges on the confidentiality requirements; we\nalso derive a genie-aided outer bound, where a hypothetical genie gives the\nunintended message to a receiver which treats it as side-information during\nequivocation computation. For both classes of channels, Csisz\\'{a}r's sum\nidentity plays a central role in establishing the capacity outer bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 13:27:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 20:38:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2011 13:53:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2011 12:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}

We\nprovide a common framework in which all kinds of selection effects on the\nBH-bulge relations can be investigated, but our main emphasis is on the\nconsequences of using broad-line AGN and their host galaxies to search for\nevolution in the BH-bulge relation. We identified relevant sources of bias that\nwere not discussed in the literature so far. A particularly important effect is\ncaused by the fact that the active fraction among SMBHs varies considerably\nwith BH mass, in the sense that high-mass BHs are less likely to be active than\nlower mass ones. In the connection with intrinsic scatter of the BH-bulge\nrelation this effect implies a bias towards a low BH mass at given bulge\nproperty. This effect adds to the bias caused by working with luminosity or\nflux limited samples that were already discussed by others. A quantitative\nprediction of these biases requires (i) a realistic model of the sample\nselection function, and (ii) knowledge of relevant underlying distribution\nfunctions. For low-redshift AGN samples we can naturally reproduce the\nflattening of the relation observed in some studies. When extending our\nanalysis to higher redshift samples we are clearly hampered by limited\nempirical constraints on the various relevant distribution functions. Using a\nbest-guess approach for these distributions we estimate the expected magnitude\nof sample selection biases for a number of recent observational attempts to\nstudy the BH-bulge evolution. In no case do we find statistically significant\nevidence for an evolving BH-bulge relation. We suggest a possible practical\napproach to circumvent several of the most problematic issues connected with\nAGN selection; this could become a powerful diagnostic in future investigations\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 13:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

However, observational\nsupport for binary-induced shaping has been sadly lacking. Here, we highlight\nthe results of a continuing programme to spatio-kinematically model the\nmorphologies of all PNe known to contain a close binary central star.\nSpatio-kinematical modelling is imperative for these objects, as it circumvents\nthe degeneracy between morphology and orientation which can adversely affect\ndeterminations of morphology based on imaging alone. Furthermore,\nspatio-kinematical modelling accurately determines the orientation of the\nnebular shell, allowing the theoretically predicted perpendicular alignment,\nbetween nebular symmetry axis and binary orbital plane, to be tested. To date,\nevery PN subjected to this investigation has displayed the predicted alignment,\nindicating that binarity has played an important role in the formation and\nevolution of these nebulae. The further results from this programme will be\nkey, not only in determining whether binary interaction is responsible for\nshaping the studied PNe, but also in assessing the importance of binarity in\nthe formation and evolution of all PNe in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 14:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 17:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We used multi-wavelength\nfollow-up observations obtained with GROND and the XRT onboard the Swift\nsatellite. The resulting afterglow light curve is of excellent accuracy, and\nthe spectral energy distribution is well-sampled over 5 decades in energy.\nThese data present one of the most comprehensive observing campaigns for a\nsingle GRB afterglow and allow us to test several proposed emission models and\noutflow characteristics in unprecedented detail. Both the multi-color light\ncurve and the broad-band SED of the afterglow of GRB 091127 show evidence of a\ncooling break moving from high to lower energies. The early light curve is well\ndescribed by a broken power-law, where the initial decay in the optical/NIR\nwavelength range is considerably flatter than at X-rays. Detailed fitting of\nthe time-resolved SED shows that the break is very smooth with a sharpness\nindex of 2.2 +- 0.2, and evolves towards lower frequencies as a power-law with\nindex -1.23 +- 0.06. These are the first accurate and contemporaneous\nmeasurements of both the sharpness of the spectral break and its time\nevolution. The measured evolution of the cooling break (nu_c propto t^-1.2) is\nnot consistent with the predictions of the standard model, wherein nu_c propto\nt^-0.5 is expected. A possible explanation for the observed behavior is a time\ndependence of the microphysical parameters, in particular the fraction of the\ntotal energy in the magnetic field epsilon_B. This conclusion provides further\nevidence that the standard fireball model is too simplistic, and time-dependent\nmicro-physical parameters may be required to model the growing number of\nwell-sampled afterglow light curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 14:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The attractive interaction between\nfermions, that can be induced by density fluctuations of the bosonic\nbackground, can give rise to a superfluid phase in the Fermi component of the\nmixture. The atoms of both species are assumed to be in only one internal\nstate, so that the pairing of fermions is effective only in odd-l channels. No\nassumption about the value of the ratio between the Fermi velocity and the\nsound velocity in the Bose gas is made in the derivation of the energy gap\nequation. The gap equation is solved without any particular \"ansatz\" for the\npairing field or the effective interaction. The p-wave superfluidity is studied\nin detail. By increasing the strength and/or decreasing the range of the\neffective interaction a transition of the fermion pairing regime, from the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state to a system of tightly bound couples can be\nrealized.

Their decay, which injects entropy in the thermal bath, is responsible\nfor a second reheating, dubbed re-reheating, that could substantially dilute\nthe matter-antimatter asymmetry created before. In this paper we analyze such\nlate re-reheating and entropy dilution. It turns out that in some cases the\nusual analytic calculation badly fails if it is not rectified by some\ncorrective factors that we provide. We also determine the parameter space where\nthe entropy dilution compromises models of baryogenesis. This region can be\nobtained by imposing some generic constraints that are applicable to any\nbaryogenesis mechanism and long-lived field satisfying a few assumptions. For\ninstance, by applying them to MSSM electroweak baryogenesis, thermal\nnon-resonant leptogenesis and thermal resonant leptogenesis, we obtain that the\ninitial abundances of long-lived fields with lifetime longer than respectively\n5*10^13, 10^-2 and 10^15 GeV^-1 are strongly constrained.
