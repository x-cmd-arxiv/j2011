The goal is to seek\nan over-complete dictionary from which every training signal can be best\napproximated by a linear combination of only a few codewords. This task is\noften achieved by iteratively executing two operations: sparse coding and\ndictionary update. In the literature, there are two benchmark mechanisms to\nupdate a dictionary. The first approach, such as the MOD algorithm, is\ncharacterized by searching for the optimal codewords while fixing the sparse\ncoefficients. In the second approach, represented by the K-SVD method, one\ncodeword and the related sparse coefficients are simultaneously updated while\nall other codewords and coefficients remain unchanged. We propose a novel\nframework that generalizes the aforementioned two methods. The unique feature\nof our approach is that one can update an arbitrary set of codewords and the\ncorresponding sparse coefficients simultaneously: when sparse coefficients are\nfixed, the underlying optimization problem is similar to that in the MOD\nalgorithm; when only one codeword is selected for update, it can be proved that\nthe proposed algorithm is equivalent to the K-SVD method; and more importantly,\nour method allows us to update all codewords and all sparse coefficients\nsimultaneously, hence the term simultaneous codeword optimization (SimCO).\nUnder the proposed framework, we design two algorithms, namely, primitive and\nregularized SimCO. We implement these two algorithms based on a simple gradient\ndescent mechanism. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of\nthe proposed algorithms, as compared with two baseline algorithms MOD and\nK-SVD. Results show that regularized SimCO is particularly appealing in terms\nof both learning performance and running speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2011 20:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2011 16:37:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 21:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

In such a world, which is not unlike the current situation,\ngigascale space projects face a combination of inhibiting factors: the enormous\ncost threshold, the need for risky and costly development of often quite\napplication specific technology, the relatively little benefit with respect to\nthe costs for the sponsors, the time span of at least a few generations and the\nabsence of a sense of urgency.

First, a preliminary investigation is conducted\nassuming that planet and moon's orbit are circular and coplanar. This analysis\nis then applied to the case of the pulsar planet PSR B1620-26 b, and used to\nconclude that a stable moon orbiting this pulsar planet could be detected, if\nits mass was >5% of its planet's mass (2.5 Jupiter masses), and if the\nplanet-moon distance was ~ 2% of the planet-pulsar separation (23 AU).\nTime-of-arrival expressions are then derived for mutually inclined as well as\nnon-circular orbits.\n  For the case of the photometric transit timing technique, a different\napproach is adopted.

We\nshow that the conductor-insulator transition at low contents $\\phi$ of the\nconducting fillers does not determine the behavior of $\\sigma$ at larger\nconcentrations, in striking contrast to what is predicted by percolation\ntheory.

As a\nconsequence, by varying the range and depth of the potential while keeping the\nstickiness fixed, composites with similar conductor-insulator transitions may\ndisplay conductivity variations of several orders of magnitude at intermediate\nand large $\\phi$ values. By using a recently developed effective medium theory\nand the critical path approximation we explain this behavior in terms of\ndominant tunneling processes which involve interparticle distances spanning\ndifferent regions of the square-well fluid structure as $\\phi$ is varied.

The signal process is the top quark pair production with one of the\ntop quarks decaying to a charged Higgs (non SM anomalous top quark decay) and\nthe other decaying to a W boson which is assumed to decay hadronically to two\nlight jets. Due to the small branching ratio of charged Higgs decay to muon,\nresults are quoted for data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 300\nfb^-1 which is expected to be collected at the LHC high luminosity regime. It\nis shown that a signal significance close to 5 down to below 1 is achievable\nfor a charged Higgs mass in the range 80 GeV < m(H \\pm) < 150 GeV taking the\ntop quark pair production with both top quarks decaying to W bosons as the main\nirreducible background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2011 13:16:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 13:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 11:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-09"}

The original superstring and the reduced model are in\ndirect correspondence at the classical level but their relation at the quantum\nlevel remains an open question. As was found earlier, the one-loop partition\nfunctions of the two theories computed on the respective classical backgrounds\nmatch; here we explore the fate of this relation at the two-loop level. We\nconsider the example of the reduced theory solution corresponding to the long\nfolded spinning string in AdS. The logarithm of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring\npartition function computed on the spinning string background is known to be\nproportional to the universal scaling function which depends on the string\ntension ~ \\l^{1/2} where \\l=\\lambda is `t Hooft coupling. Its \"quantum\" part is\nf(\\l) = a1 + \\l^{-1/2} a2 + ... where the one-loop term is a1 = - 3 \\ln 2 and\nthe two-loop term is minus the Catalan's constant, a2=-K. We find that the\ncounterpart of f(\\l) in the reduced theory is f'(k) =a1' + 2 k^{-1} a2' + ...,\nwhere k is the coupling of the reduced theory. Here the one-loop coefficient is\nthe same as in the string theory, a1'= a1, while the two-loop one is a2' =a2 -\n1/4 (a1)^2. Remarkably, the first Catalan's constant term here matches the\nstring theory result if we identify the two couplings as k= 2\\l^{1/2}.\nNevertheless, the presence of the additional (a1)^2 ~ (\\ln 2)^2 term implies\nthat a relation between the two quantum partition functions (if any) is not a\nsimple equality. Similar results are found in the case of AdS_3 x S^3\nsuperstring theory where a1= - 2 \\ln 2 and a2=0, while in the corresponding\nreduced theory a1'=a1, a2'= a2- 1/4 (a1)^2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2011 14:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
