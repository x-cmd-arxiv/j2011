Even though kMC methods are accurate, they are\ncomputationally expensive for large-scale systems. Hence approximation\nalgorithms are necessary for simulating experimentally observed properties and\nmorphologies. One such approximation method stems from the coarse graining of\nthe lattice which leads to coarse-grained Monte Carlo (GCMC) methods while\nLangevin approximations can further accelerate the simulations. Moreover,\nsacrificing fine scale (i.e. microscopic) accuracy, mesoscopic deterministic or\nstochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are efficiently applied for\nsimulating surface processes. In this paper, we are interested in simulating\nsurface diffusion for pattern formation applications which is achieved by\nsuitably discretizing the mesoscopic SPDE in space.

Recently, AS was shown to occur in\nsystems of simplified neuron models, requiring the coupling of the neuronal\nmembrane potential with its delayed value. However, this coupling has no\nobvious biological correlate. Here we propose a canonical neuronal microcircuit\nwith standard chemical synapses, where the delayed inhibition is provided by an\ninterneuron. In this biologically plausible scenario, a smooth transition from\ndelayed synchronization (DS) to AS typically occurs when the inhibitory\nsynaptic conductance is increased. The phenomenon is shown to be robust when\nmodel parameters are varied within physiological range. Since the DS-AS\ntransition amounts to an inversion in the timing of the pre- and post-synaptic\nspikes, our results could have a bearing on spike-timing-dependent-plasticity\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 18:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-12"}

It is used widely in practice, for example, for power\nallocation to sub-carriers in multi-user OFDM systems such as WiMax. The\nclassic water-filling algorithm is deterministic and requires perfect knowledge\nof the channel gain to noise ratios. In this paper we consider how to do power\nallocation over stochastically time-varying (i.i.d.) channels with unknown gain\nto noise ratio distributions. We adopt an online learning framework based on\nstochastic multi-armed bandits. We consider two variations of the problem, one\nin which the goal is to find a power allocation to maximize $\\sum\\limits_i\n\\mathbb{E}[\\log(1 + SNR_i)]$, and another in which the goal is to find a power\nallocation to maximize $\\sum\\limits_i \\log(1 + \\mathbb{E}[SNR_i])$. For the\nfirst problem, we propose a \\emph{cognitive water-filling} algorithm that we\ncall CWF1. We show that CWF1 obtains a regret (defined as the cumulative gap\nover time between the sum-rate obtained by a distribution-aware genie and this\npolicy) that grows polynomially in the number of channels and logarithmically\nin time, implying that it asymptotically achieves the optimal time-averaged\nrate that can be obtained when the gain distributions are known. For the second\nproblem, we present an algorithm called CWF2, which is, to our knowledge, the\nfirst algorithm in the literature on stochastic multi-armed bandits to exploit\nnon-linear dependencies between the arms. We prove that the number of times\nCWF2 picks the incorrect power allocation is bounded by a function that is\npolynomial in the number of channels and logarithmic in time, implying that its\nfrequency of incorrect allocation tends to zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 18:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-12"}

A diagnostic policy is a complete description of the decision-making\nactions of a diagnostician (i.e., tests followed by a diagnostic decision) for\nall possible combinations of test results. An optimal diagnostic policy is one\nthat minimizes the expected total cost, which is the sum of measurement costs\nand misdiagnosis costs. In most diagnostic settings, there is a tradeoff\nbetween these two kinds of costs. This paper formalizes diagnostic decision\nmaking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The paper introduces a new family of\nsystematic search algorithms based on the AO* algorithm to solve this MDP. To\nmake AO* efficient, the paper describes an admissible heuristic that enables\nAO* to prune large parts of the search space. The paper also introduces several\ngreedy algorithms including some improvements over previously-published\nmethods. The paper then addresses the question of learning diagnostic policies\nfrom examples. When the probabilities of diseases and test results are computed\nfrom training data, there is a great danger of overfitting. To reduce\noverfitting, regularizers are integrated into the search algorithms. Finally,\nthe paper compares the proposed methods on five benchmark diagnostic data sets.\nThe studies show that in most cases the systematic search methods produce\nbetter diagnostic policies than the greedy methods.

Despite their promise, current BDI team\napproaches lack tools for quantitative performance analysis under uncertainty.\nDistributed partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) are well\nsuited for such analysis, but the complexity of finding optimal policies in\nsuch models is highly intractable. The key contribution of this article is a\nhybrid BDI-POMDP approach, where BDI team plans are exploited to improve POMDP\ntractability and POMDP analysis improves BDI team plan performance. Concretely,\nwe focus on role allocation, a fundamental problem in BDI teams: which agents\nto allocate to the different roles in the team. The article provides three key\ncontributions. First, we describe a role allocation technique that takes into\naccount future uncertainties in the domain; prior work in multiagent role\nallocation has failed to address such uncertainties. To that end, we introduce\nRMTDP (Role-based Markov Team Decision Problem), a new distributed POMDP model\nfor analysis of role allocations. Our technique gains in tractability by\nsignificantly curtailing RMTDP policy search; in particular, BDI team plans\nprovide incomplete RMTDP policies, and the RMTDP policy search fills the gaps\nin such incomplete policies by searching for the best role allocation. Our\nsecond key contribution is a novel decomposition technique to further improve\nRMTDP policy search efficiency. Even though limited to searching role\nallocations, there are still combinatorially many role allocations, and\nevaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Our\ndecomposition technique exploits the structure in the BDI team plans to\nsignificantly prune the search space of role allocations. Our third key\ncontribution is a significantly faster policy evaluation algorithm suited for\nour BDI-POMDP hybrid approach. Finally, we also present experimental results\nfrom two domains: mission rehearsal simulation and RoboCupRescue disaster\nrescue simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 20:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

Agents maintain beliefs over physical states of\nthe environment and over models of other agents, and they use Bayesian updates\nto maintain their beliefs over time. The solutions map belief states to\nactions. Models of other agents may include their belief states and are related\nto agent types considered in games of incomplete information. We express the\nagents autonomy by postulating that their models are not directly manipulable\nor observable by other agents.

The\nsubproblem of content selection for object descriptions in task-oriented\ndialogue has been the focus of much previous work and a large number of models\nhave been proposed. In this paper, we use the annotated COCONUT corpus of\ntask-oriented design dialogues to develop feature sets based on Dale and\nReiters (1995) incremental model, Brennan and Clarks (1996) conceptual pact\nmodel, and Jordans (2000b) intentional influences model, and use these feature\nsets in a machine learning experiment to automatically learn a model of content\nselection for object descriptions. Since Dale and Reiters model requires a\nrepresentation of discourse structure, the corpus annotations are used to\nderive a representation based on Grosz and Sidners (1986) theory of the\nintentional structure of discourse, as well as two very simple representations\nof discourse structure based purely on recency. We then apply the\nrule-induction program RIPPER to train and test the content selection component\nof an object description generator on a set of 393 object descriptions from the\ncorpus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported experiment of a trainable\ncontent selection component for object description generation in dialogue.\nThree separate content selection models that are based on the three theoretical\nmodels, all independently achieve accuracies significantly above the majority\nclass baseline (17%) on unseen test data, with the intentional influences model\n(42.4%) performing significantly better than either the incremental model\n(30.4%) or the conceptual pact model (28.9%). But the best performing models\ncombine all the feature sets, achieving accuracies near 60%. Surprisingly, a\nsimple recency-based representation of discourse structure does as well as one\nbased on intentional structure. To our knowledge, this is also the first\nempirical comparison of a representation of Grosz and Sidners model of\ndiscourse structure with a simpler model for any generation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 20:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

For example, accurate fault\ndiagnosis in factory assembly processes requires inferring the probabilities of\nerroneous assembly operations, but doing this efficiently and accurately is\ndifficult. Modeled as dynamic Bayesian networks, these processes have discrete\nvariables with very large domains and extremely high dimensionality. In this\npaper, we introduce relational dynamic Bayesian networks (RDBNs), which are an\nextension of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to first-order logic. RDBNs are a\ngeneralization of dynamic probabilistic relational models (DPRMs), which we had\nproposed in our previous work to model dynamic uncertain domains. We first\nextend the Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering described in our earlier work\nto RDBNs. Next, we lift the assumptions associated with Rao-Blackwellization in\nRDBNs and propose two new forms of particle filtering. The first one uses\nabstraction hierarchies over the predicates to smooth the particle filters\nestimates. The second employs kernel density estimation with a kernel function\nspecifically designed for relational domains. Experiments show these two\nmethods greatly outperform standard particle filtering on the task of assembly\nplan execution monitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 20:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

Focusing on the well known Perceptron and Winnow algorithms,\nthe paper demonstrates a tradeoff between the computational efficiency with\nwhich the algorithm can be run over the expanded feature space and the\ngeneralization ability of the corresponding learning algorithm. We first\ndescribe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of\nconjunctions or all conjunctions.

Such conditions are given by the missing at random\n(mar) and coarsened at random (car) assumptions. In this paper we provide an\nin-depth analysis of several questions relating to mar/car assumptions. Main\npurpose of our study is to provide criteria by which one may evaluate whether a\ncar assumption is reasonable for a particular data collecting or observational\nprocess. This question is complicated by the fact that several distinct\nversions of mar/car assumptions exist. We therefore first provide an overview\nover these different versions, in which we highlight the distinction between\ndistributional and coarsening variable induced versions. We show that\ndistributional versions are less restrictive and sufficient for most\napplications. We then address from two different perspectives the question of\nwhen the mar/car assumption is warranted. First we provide a static analysis\nthat characterizes the admissibility of the car assumption in terms of the\nsupport structure of the joint probability distribution of complete data and\nincomplete observations. Here we obtain an equivalence characterization that\nimproves and extends a recent result by Grunwald and Halpern. We then turn to a\nprocedural analysis that characterizes the admissibility of the car assumption\nin terms of procedural models for the actual data (or observation) generating\nprocess. The main result of this analysis is that the stronger coarsened\ncompletely at random (ccar) condition is arguably the most reasonable\nassumption, as it alone corresponds to data coarsening procedures that satisfy\na natural robustness property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 20:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

In many domains, the performance of a planner can greatly\nbe improved by discovering and exploiting information about the domain\nstructure that is not explicitly encoded in the initial PDDL formulation. In\nthis paper we present and compare two automated methods that learn relevant\ninformation from previous experience in a domain and use it to solve new\nproblem instances. Our methods share a common four-step strategy. First, a\ndomain is analyzed and structural information is extracted, then\nmacro-operators are generated based on the previously discovered structure. A\nfiltering and ranking procedure selects the most useful macro-operators.\nFinally, the selected macros are used to speed up future searches. We have\nsuccessfully used such an approach in the fourth international planning\ncompetition IPC-4. Our system, Macro-FF, extends Hoffmanns state-of-the-art\nplanner FF 2.3 with support for two kinds of macro-operators, and with\nengineering enhancements.

Even in the classical limit, its\nproperties are far from simple. The \"120 degree\" ground state favoured by the\nfrustrated antiferromagnetic interactions contains a hidden chiral symmetry,\nand supports two distinct types of excitation. And famously, three distinct\nphases, including a collinear one-third magnetisation plateau, are stabilised\nby thermal fluctuations in applied magnetic field. The questions of\nsymmetry-breaking raised by this model are deep and subtle, and after more than\nthirty years of study, many of the details of its phase diagram remain\nsurprisingly obscure. In this paper we use modern Monte Carlo simulation\ntechniques to determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the classical\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice in applied magnetic field.\nAt low to intermediate values of magnetic field, we find evidence for a\ncontinuous phase transition from the paramagnet into the collinear one-third\nmagnetisation plateau, belonging to the three-state Potts universality class.\nWe also find evidence for conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransitions from the one-third magnetisation plateau into the canted \"Y-state\",\nand into the 2:1 canted phase found at high fields. However, the phase\ntransition from the paramagnet into the 2:1 canted phase, while continuous,\ndoes not appear to fall into any conventional universality class. We argue that\nthis, like the chiral phase transition discussed in zero field, deserves\nfurther study as an interesting example of a finite-temperature phase\ntransition with compound order-parameter symmetry.

This entails, as a preliminary step, ascertaining sets of test\nfunctions that determine the operator, as well as the derivation of a\ncorresponding reconstruction scheme. In the present paper we exploit a recent\nbreakthrough in the theory of stable polynomials to solve the stated inverse\nproblem completely.

Recent studies revealed that some living fossils such as the\nlungfish are indeed evolving more slowly than other vertebrates (2, 3). The\nreason for the slower rate of evolution in these lineages remains unclear, but\nthe same observations suggest a possible genome size effect on rates of\nevolution. Genome size (C-value) in vertebrates varies over 200 fold ranging\nfrom pufferfish (0.4 pg) to lungfish (132.8 pg) (4). Variation in genome size\nand architecture is a fundamental cellular adaptation that remains poorly\nunderstood (5). C-value is correlated with several allometric traits such as\nbody size and developmental rates in many, but not all, organisms (6, 7). To\ndate, no consensus exists concerning the mechanisms driving genome size\nevolution or the effect that genome size has on species traits such as\nevolutionary rates (8-12). In the following we show that: 1) within the same\nrange of divergence times, genetic diversity decreases as genome size increases\nand 2) average rates of molecular evolution decline with increasing genome size\nin vertebrates. Together, these observations indicate that genome size is an\nimportant factor influencing rates of speciation and extinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2011 11:20:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2013 00:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-12"}

Traditionally, a fixed\nEulerian mesh is often employed for this purpose, which in modern schemes may\nalso be adaptively refined during a calculation. Particle-based methods on the\nother hand discretize the mass instead of the volume, yielding an approximately\nLagrangian approach. It is also possible to achieve Lagrangian behavior in\nmesh-based methods if the mesh is allowed to move with the flow. However, such\napproaches have often been fraught with substantial problems related to the\ndevelopment of irregularity in the mesh topology. Here we describe a novel\nscheme that eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured\nmesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh\nis used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a\nfinite volume approach, based on a second-order Godunov scheme with an exact\nRiemann solver. A particularly powerful feature of the approach is that the\nmesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are given\nthe velocity of the local flow, a highly accurate Lagrangian formulation of\ncontinuum hydrodynamics is obtained that is free of mesh distortion problems,\nwhile it is at the same time fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian\ncodes.

A fully classical approach\nis used to observe the influence of initial angle of nucleus orientation to the\nproduct yielded by the reaction. As an example, a simplest fusion reaction\nbetween 1H2 and 1H3 is observed. Several products of the fusion reaction have\nbeen obtained, even the unreported ones, including temporary 2He4 nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2011 05:21:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 14:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-10"}
