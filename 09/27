However, each study tends to focus on a particular problem, leaving\nunclear the overall structure of variability in populations. This fractured\nconceptual framework often causes particular applications to be incomplete or\nimproperly analyzed. In this paper, I present a concise introduction to the two\nkey aspects of the theory. First, all measures of fitness ultimately arise from\nthe relative comparison of the reproductive success of individuals or genotypes\nwith the average reproductive success in the population. That relative measure\ncreates a diminishing relation between reproductive success and fitness.\nDiminishing returns reduce fitness in proportion to variability in reproductive\nsuccess. The relative measurement of success also induces a frequency\ndependence that favors rare types. Second, variability in populations has a\nhierarchical structure. Variable success in different traits of an individual\naffects that individual's variation in reproduction. Correlation between\ndifferent individuals' reproduction affects variation in the aggregate success\nof particular alleles across the population. One must consider the hierarchical\nstructure of variability in relation to different consequences of temporal,\nspatial, and developmental variability. Although a complete analysis of\nvariability has many separate parts, this simple framework allows one to see\nthe structure of the whole and to place particular problems in their proper\nrelation to the general theory. The biological understanding of relative\nsuccess and the hierarchical structure of variability in populations may also\ncontribute to a deeper economic theory of returns under uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 16:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}

In this paper, I show how developmental\nvariability alters evolutionary dynamics by smoothing the landscape that\nrelates genotype to fitness. In a fitness landscape with multiple peaks and\nvalleys, developmental variability can smooth the landscape to provide a\ndirectly increasing path of fitness to the highest peak. Developmental\nvariability also allows initial survival of a genotype in response to novel or\nextreme environmental challenge, providing an opportunity for subsequent\nadaptation.

Since the energy costs of operating such a large IT\ninfrastructure are a significant fraction of the total operating costs, we\nargue for redesigning CDNs to incorporate energy optimizations as a first-order\nprinciple. We propose techniques to turn off CDN servers during periods of low\nload while seeking to balance three key design goals: maximize energy\nreduction, minimize the impact on client-perceived service availability (SLAs),\nand limit the frequency of on-off server transitions to reduce wear-and-tear\nand its impact on hardware reliability. We propose an optimal offline algorithm\nand an online algorithm to extract energy savings both at the level of local\nload balancing within a data center and global load balancing across data\ncenters. We evaluate our algorithms using real production workload traces from\na large commercial CDN. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the\nenergy consumption of a CDN by more than 55% while ensuring a high level of\navailability that meets customer SLA requirements and incurring an average of\none on-off transition per server per day. Further, we show that keeping even\n10% of the servers as hot spares helps absorb load spikes due to global flash\ncrowds with little impact on availability SLAs. Finally, we show that\nredistributing load across proximal data centers can enhance service\navailability significantly, but has only a modest impact on energy savings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 17:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-27"}

The topology of this\nconfiguration is that of an asymmetric coronal null-point, with a closed fan\nsurface and an open outer spine. When driven by slow photospheric shearing\nmotions, field lines, initially fully anchored below the fan dome, reconnect at\nthe null point, and jump to the open magnetic domain. This is the standard\ninterchange mode as sketched and calculated in 2D.

The 3He content of Galactic HII regions is very close to that of the\nSun and the solar system, and only slightly higher than the primordial 3He\nabundance as predicted by the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, the\nclassical theory of stellar evolution predicts a high production of 3He by\nlow-mass stars, implying a strong increase of 3He with time in the Galaxy. This\nis the well-known \"3He problem\". Aims. We study the effects of thermohaline and\nrotation-induced mixings on the production and destruction of 3He over the\nlifetime of low- and intermediate-mass stars at various metallicities. Methods.\nWe compute stellar evolutionary models in the mass range 1 to 6M\\odot for four\nmetallicities, taking into account thermohaline instability and\nrotation-induced mixing. For the thermohaline diffusivity we use the\nprescription based on the linear stability analysis, which reproduces Red Giant\nBranch (RGB) abundance patterns at all metallicities. Rotation-induced mixing\nis treated taking into account meridional circulation and shear turbulence. We\ndiscuss the effects of these processes on internal and surface abundances of\n3He and on the net yields. Results. Over the whole mass and metallicity range\ninvestigated, rotation-induced mixing lowers the 3He production, as well as the\nupper mass limit at which stars destroy 3He. For low-mass stars, thermohaline\nmixing occuring beyond the RGB bump is the dominant process in strongly\nreducing the net 3He yield compared to standard computations. Yet these stars\nremain net 3He producers. Conclusions. Overall, the net 3He yields are strongly\nreduced compared to the standard framework predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 20:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

To address this, many\nresearchers have developed techniques that allow the agents to make decisions\nbased on estimates of the states and actions of other agents that are typically\nlearnt using some form of machine learning algorithm. Nevertheless, many of\nthese approaches fail to provide an actual means by which the necessary\ninformation is made available so that the estimates can be learnt. To this end,\nwe argue that cooperative communication of state information between agents is\none such mechanism. However, in a dynamically changing environment, the\naccuracy and timeliness of this communicated information determine the fidelity\nof the learned estimates and the usefulness of the actions taken based on\nthese.

We identify several key characteristics of the\ntopology under h^+, concerning the existence/non-existence of unrecognized dead\nends, as well as the existence/non-existence of constant upper bounds on the\ndifficulty of escaping local minima and benches. These distinctions divide the\n(set of all) planning domains into a taxonomy of classes of varying h^+\ntopology. As it turns out, many of the 30 investigated domains lie in classes\nwith a relatively easy topology. Most particularly, 12 of the domains lie in\nclasses where FFs search algorithm, provided with h^+, is a polynomial solving\nmechanism. We also present results relating h^+ to its approximation as\nimplemented in FF. The behavior regarding dead ends is provably the same. We\nsummarize the results of an empirical investigation showing that, in many\ndomains, the topological qualities of h^+ are largely inherited by the\napproximation. The overall investigation gives a rare example of a successful\nanalysis of the connections between typical-case problem structure, and search\nperformance. The theoretical investigation also gives hints on how the\ntopological phenomena might be automatically recognizable by domain analysis\ntechniques. We outline some preliminary steps we made into that direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 20:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}

Popular models assume\nthat UV photons alone are responsible for reionization of the intergalactic\nmedium. We explore the effects of a significant contribution of X-rays to\nreionization on the kSZ signal. Because X-rays have a large mean free path\nthrough the neutral intergalactic medium, they introduce partial ionization in\nbetween the sharp-edged bubbles created by UV photons. This smooth ionization\ncomponent changes the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ntemperature anisotropies. We quantify this effect by running semi-numerical\nsimulations of reionization. We test a number of different models of\nreionization without X-rays that have varying physical parameters, but which\nare constrained to have similar total optical depths to electron scattering.\nThese are then compared to models with varying levels of contribution to\nreionization from X-rays. We find that models with more than a 10% contribution\nfrom X-rays produce a significantly lower power spectrum of temperature\nanisotropies than all the UV-only models tested. The expected sensitivity of\nSPT and ACT may be insufficient to distinguish between our models, however, a\nnon-detection of the kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization could result\nfrom the contribution of X-rays.

To find this maximum efficiently, the function L(H)\nis not evaluated exactly for each hypothesis H, but rather upper and lower\nbounds for it are computed at a much lower cost. In order to obtain bounds for\nL(H) that are tight yet inexpensive to compute, we extend the theory of shapes\ndescribed in [14] to handle projections of shapes. This extension allows us to\ndefine a probabilistic relationship between the prior knowledge given in 3D and\nthe 2D input image. This relationship is derived from first principles and is\nproven to be the only relationship having the properties that we intuitively\nexpect from a \"projection.\" In addition to the efficiency and optimality\ncharacteristics of H&B algorithms, the proposed framework has the desirable\nproperty of integrating information in the 2D image with information in the 3D\nprior to estimate the optimal reconstruction. While this article focuses\nprimarily on the problem mentioned above, we believe that the theory presented\nherein has multiple other potential applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 21:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}

In such open settings, agents are often coordinated\nusing standardized agent conversation protocols. The representation of such\nprotocols (for analysis, validation, monitoring, etc) is an important aspect of\nmulti-agent applications. Recently, Petri nets have been shown to be an\ninteresting approach to such representation, and radically different approaches\nusing Petri nets have been proposed. However, their relative strengths and\nweaknesses have not been examined. Moreover, their scalability and suitability\nfor different tasks have not been addressed. This paper addresses both these\nchallenges. First, we analyze existing Petri net representations in terms of\ntheir scalability and appropriateness for overhearing, an important task in\nmonitoring open multi-agent systems. Then, building on the insights gained, we\nintroduce a novel representation using Colored Petri nets that explicitly\nrepresent legal joint conversation states and messages. This representation\napproach offers significant improvements in scalability and is particularly\nsuitable for overhearing. Furthermore, we show that this new representation\noffers a comprehensive coverage of all conversation features of FIPA\nconversation standards. We also present a procedure for transforming AUML\nconversation protocol diagrams (a standard human-readable representation), to\nour Colored Petri net representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 21:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}

The Monte\nCarlo method is more accurate but involves the tedious process of running and\ncross-correlating a large number of N-body simulations, in which the survey\nvolume is embedded. From 200 N-body simulations, we extract a non-linear\ncovariance matrix as a function of two scales and of the angle between two\nFourier modes. All the non-Gaussian features of that matrix are then simply\nparametrized in terms of a few fitting functions and Eigenvectors.

Existing methods\nfor computing the hm heuristic require time exponential in m, limiting them to\nsmall values (m andlt= 2). The hm heuristic can also be viewed as the optimal\ncost function in a relaxation of the search space: this paper presents relaxed\nsearch, a method for computing this function partially by searching in the\nrelaxed space. The relaxed search method, because it computes hm only\npartially, is computationally cheaper and therefore usable for higher values of\nm. The (complete) hm heuristic is combined with partial hm heuristics, for m =\n3,..., computed by relaxed search, resulting in a more accurate heuristic.\n  This use of the relaxed search method to improve on the hm heuristic is\nevaluated by comparing two optimal temporal planners: TP4, which does not use\nit, and HSP*a, which uses it but is otherwise identical to TP4.

Assuming that the CO J=3-2\nline was optically thin, the mass-loss rate of the superwind in this PPN was\nfound to be at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than the typical range. In\norder to obtain a more accurate mass-loss rate, we reexamine this data and\nconstruct a radiative transfer model to compare with the data. Also, in order\nto better resolve the superwind, we adopt a different weighting on the data to\nobtain maps at higher resolution. Our result shows that the CO J=3-2 emission\nis located slightly further away from the central source than the mid-IR\nemission, probably because that the material is cooler in the outer part and\nthus better traced by the CO emission. At lower resolution, however, the CO\nemission appeared to be spatially coincident with the mid-IR emission. Our\nmodel has two components, an inner ellipsoidal shell-like superwind with an\nequatorial density enhancement and an outer spheroidal AGB wind. The thick\ntorus in previous model could be considered as the dense equatorial part of our\nellipsoidal superwind. With radiative transfer, our model reproduces more\nobserved features than previous model and obtains an averaged superwind\nmass-loss rate of ~ 1.8 x 10^-5 solar mass per year, which is typical for a\nsuperwind. The mass-loss rate in the equatorial plane is 3 x 10^-5 solar mass\nper year, also the same as that derived before from modeling CO J=1-0 emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 03:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The difference between\nthese two dynamic descriptions is due to higher-order quantum corrections. Two\nthermal bath models, classical white noise (the Haken-Strobl-Reineker model)\nand quantum Debye model, are considered. In the seven-site FMO model, we\nobserve that higher-order corrections lead to negligible changes in the\ntrapping time or in energy transfer efficiency around the optimal and\nphysiological conditions (2% in the HSR model and 0.1% in the quantum Debye\nmodel for the initial site at BChl 1).

In recent years, major breakthroughs have\nbeen made in a study of counting constraint satisfaction problems (or #CSPs).\nIn particular, a computational complexity classification of bounded-degree\n#CSPs has been discovered for all degrees except for two, where the \"degree\" of\nan input instance is the maximal number of times that each input variable\nappears in a given set of constraints. Despite the efforts of recent studies,\nhowever, a complexity classification of degree-2 #CSPs has eluded from our\nunderstandings.

We show that these systems present interesting situations\nwherein transmitivity $(T_b(E))$ of a finite barrier can be changed both\nquantitatively and qualitatively by varying the depth or width of the well or\nby changing the distance between the well and the barrier. Using delta (thin)\nwell near a delta (thin) barrier we show that the well induces energy\noscillations riding over $T_b(E)$ in the transmitivity $T(E)$ at both the\nenergies below and above the barrier. More generally we show that a thick well\nseparated from a thick barrier also gives rise to energy oscillations in\n$T(E)$. A well joining a barrier discontinuously (a finite jump) reduces $T(E)$\n(as compared to $T_b(E))$ over all energies. When the well and barrier are\njoined continuously, $T(E)$ increases and then decreases at energies below the\nbarrier. At energy above the the barrier the changes are inappreciable. In\nthese two cases if we separate the well and the barrier by a distance, $T(E)$\nagain acquires oscillations. Paradoxically, it turns out that a distant well\ninduces more energy oscillations in $T(E)$ than when it is near the barrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 07:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}

Here, properties of the generated jet are studied\nnumerically in the framework of a 2D general relativity magnetohydrodynamical\napproach. Due to the accumulation of the magnetic flux at the black hole\nhorizon, the jet power is expected to be modulated on a sub-second time-scale.\nAlthough the intervals between jet active phases depend on the magnetic flux\nescape from the black hole horizon (which can be modeled self-consistently only\nusing a 3D code), a general estimate of the averaged jet power is obtained.

Two phenomena\ncontribute to the width: the Landau damping phenomenon and the break-up of a\ncolour-singlet bound state into a colour-octet heavy quark-antiquark pair by\nabsorption of a thermal gluon. In the paper, we investigate the relation\nbetween the singlet-to-octet thermal break-up and the so-called\ngluo-dissociation, a mechanism for quarkonium dissociation widely used in\nphenomenological approaches. The gluo-dissociation thermal width is obtained by\nconvoluting the gluon thermal distribution with the cross section of a gluon\nand a 1S quarkonium state to a colour octet quark-antiquark state in vacuum, a\ncross section that at leading order, but neglecting colour-octet effects, was\ncomputed long ago by Bhanot and Peskin. We will, first, show that the effective\nfield theory framework provides a natural derivation of the gluo-dissociation\nfactorization formula at leading order, which is, indeed, the singlet-to-octet\nthermal break-up expression. Second, the singlet-to-octet thermal break-up\nexpression will allow us to improve the Bhanot--Peskin cross section by\nincluding the contribution of the octet potential, which amounts to include\nfinal-state interactions between the heavy quark and antiquark. Finally, we\nwill quantify the effects due to final-state interactions on the\ngluo-dissociation cross section and on the quarkonium thermal width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 10:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-10"}

Over the last couple of years, it has been recognized that such\ndeviations from slow roll inflation can also result in reasonably large\nnon-Gaussianities. The Starobinsky model involves the canonical scalar field\nand consists of a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in the slope.\nThe change in the slope causes a brief period of departure from slow roll\nwhich, in turn, results in a sharp rise in power, along with a burst of\noscillations in the scalar spectrum for modes that leave the Hubble radius just\nbefore and during the period of fast roll. The hallmark of the Starobinsky\nmodel is that it allows the scalar power spectrum to be evaluated analytically\nin terms of the three parameters that describe the model. We evaluate the\nbi-spectrum of the scalar perturbations in the Starobinsky model in the\nequilateral limit. Remarkably, we find that, all the different contributions to\nthe the bi-spectrum too can be evaluated completely analytically. We show that\nthe quantity $\\fnl$, which characterizes the extent of non-Gaussianity, can be\nexpressed purely in terms of the ratio of the two slopes on either side of the\ndiscontinuity in the potential. Further, we find that, for certain values of\nthe parameters, $\\fnl$ in the Starobinsky model can be as large as the mean\nvalue that has been arrived at from the analysis of the recent CMB data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 11:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Using data\nfrom a high radio band, 37 GHz, uncontaminated by other radiation components\nbesides the jet emission, we study these questions with averaged flux densities\nover the the first year of Fermi operations. We look for possible correlations\nbetween the 100 MeV - 100 GeV band used by the Fermi satellite and 37 GHz radio\nband observed at the Aalto University Metsahovi Radio Telescope, as well as for\ndifferences between the gamma-ray emission of different AGN subsamples. We use\ndata averaged over the 1FGL period. Our sample includes 249 northern AGN,\nincluding a complete sample of 68 northern AGN with a measured average flux\ndensity exceeding 1 Jy. We find significant correlation between both the flux\ndensities and luminosities in gamma and radio bands. The Fermi luminosity is\ninversely correlated with the peak frequency of the synchrotron component of\nthe AGN spectral energy distributions. We also calculate the gamma dominances,\ndefined as the ratio between the gamma and radio flux densities, and find an\nindication that high-energy blazars are more gamma-dominated than low-energy\nblazars. After studying the distributions of gamma and radio luminosities, it\nis clear that BL Lacertae objects are different from quasars, with\nsignificantly lower luminosities. It is unclear whether this is an intrinsic\ndifference, an effect of variable relativistic boosting across the synchrotron\npeak frequency range, or the result of Fermi being more sensitive to hard\nspectrum sources like BL Lacertae objects. Our results suggest that the gamma\nradiation is produced co-spatially with the 37 GHz emission, i.e., in the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 11:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In\nthis work, we only consider erosion dominated situations. The results are\ndiscussed by comparing them to a number of theoretical propositions and to\nexperimental findings. Two ion-beams aligned opposite to each other produce\nstationary, symmetric ripples. Two ion beams crossing at right angle will\nproduce square patterns only, if they are exactly balanced. In all other cases\nof crossed beams, ripple patterns are created, and their orientations are shown\nto be predictable from linear continuum theory. In sequential ion beam\nsputtering we find a very rapid destruction of structures created from the\nprevious beam direction after a rotation step, which leads to a transient\ndecrease of overall roughness. Superpositions of patterns from several rotation\nsteps are difficult to obtain, as they exist only in very short time windows.\nIn setups with a single beam directed towards a rotating sample, we find a\nnon-monotonic dependence of roughness on rotation frequency, with a very\npronounced minimum appearing at the frequency scale set by the relaxation of\nprestructures observed in sequential ion beam setups. Furthermore we find that\nthe logarithm of the height of structures decreases proportional to the inverse\nfrequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 13:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

In contrast to classical stratifications in Archimedean fields,\nt-stratifications also contain non-local information about the stratified sets.\nFor example, they do not only see the singularities in the valued field, but\nalso those in the residue field.\n  Like Whitney stratifications, t-stratifications exist for different classes\nof subsets of $K^n$, e.g. algebraic subvarieties or certain classes of analytic\nsubsets. The general framework are definable sets (in the sense of model\ntheory) in a language that satisfies certain hypotheses.\n  We give two applications. First, we show that t-stratifications in suitable\nvalued fields $K$ induce classical Whitney stratifications in $\\Bbb R$ or $\\Bbb\nC$; in particular, the existence of t-stratifications implies the existence of\nWhitney stratifications. This uses methods of non-standard analysis.\n  Second, we show how, using t-stratifications, one can determine the\nultra-metric isometry type of definable subsets of $\\Bbb Z_p^n$ for $p$\nsufficiently big.

From our single pointing GMRT observation of ~12 hours we\nobtain a high-resolution (26\" x 22\") image of ~11.3 square degrees, fully\ncovering the Bootes field region and beyond. The image has a central noise\nlevel of ~1.0 mJy/beam, which rises to 2.0-2.5 mJy/beam at the field edge,\nplacing it amongst the deepest ~150 MHz surveys to date. The catalog of 598\nextracted sources is estimated to be ~92 percent complete for >10 mJy sources,\nwhile the estimated contamination with false detections is <1 percent. The low\nRMS position uncertainty of 1.24\" facilitates accurate matching against\ncatalogs at optical, infrared and other wavelengths. Differential source counts\nare determined down to <~10 mJy. There is no evidence for flattening of the\ncounts towards lower flux densities as observed in deep radio surveys at higher\nfrequencies, suggesting that our catalog is dominated by the classical\nradio-loud AGN population that explains the counts at higher flux densities.\nCombination with available deep 1.4 GHz observations yields an accurate\ndetermination of spectral indices for 417 sources down to the lowest 153 MHz\nflux densities, of which 16 have ultra-steep spectra with spectral indices\nbelow -1.3. We confirm that flattening of the median spectral index towards low\nflux densities also occurs at this frequency. The detection fraction of the\nradio sources in NIR Ks-band is found to drop with radio spectral index, which\nis in agreement with the known correlation between spectral index and redshift\nfor brighter radio sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 14:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Since programming problems\nbecome more and more complexes and transverses, our vision is that application\ndevelopment should be process at two scales: micro- and macro-programming where\nat the micro-level the paradigm is step-by-step and at macro-level the paradigm\nis emergence. For micro-programming, which focuses on how things happen,\npopular languages, Java, C++, Python, are imperative writing languages where\nthe code is a sequence of sentences executed by the computer. For\nmacro-programming, which focuses on how things connect, popular languages,\nlabVIEW, Blender, Simulink, are graphical data flow languages such that the\nprogram is a composition of operators, a unit-process consuming input data and\nproducing output data, and connectors, a data-flow between an output data and\nan input data of two operators. However, despite their fruitful applications,\nthese macro-languages are not transversal since different data-structures of\nnative data-structures cannot be integrated in their framework easily.
