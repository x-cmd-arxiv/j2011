(2)\nAn ad hoc anti-tachyon model whose timing shrinkage may accommodate SN1987A\nburst but greatly disagree with energy independent Cern-Opera super-luminal\nspeed. (3) A split neutrino flavor speed (among a common real mass relativistic\nneutrino electron component and a super-luminal neutrino {\\mu}) in an ad hoc\nfrozen speed scenario that is leading to the prompt neutrino de-coherence and\nthe rapid flavor mixing (between electron and muon ones) that are in conflict\nwith most oscillation records.

Then, we show\nthat, in the large angular momentum limit, it separates into two distinct\nsurfaces, allowing the derivation of an explicit expression for the spectrum,\nwhich is correspondingly characterised by two separate branches. The latter may\nbe interpreted in terms of two kinds of spikes appearing on the strings:\n\"large\" spikes, yielding an infinite contribution to the energy and angular\nmomentum of the string, and \"small\" spikes, representing finite excitations\nover the background of the \"large\" spikes.\n  On the other side of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we consider the sl(2) sector\nof N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.

It is shown that\ngeneralized hash-and-forward (GHF) can achieve the capacity region of this\nchannel to within a constant number of bits in a certain weak relay regime,\nwhere the transmitter-to-relay link gains are not unboundedly stronger than the\ninterference links between the transmitters and the receivers. The GHF relaying\nstrategy is ideally suited for the broadcasting relay because it can be\nimplemented in an incremental fashion, i.e., the relay message to one receiver\nis a degraded version of the message to the other receiver. A\ngeneralized-degree-of-freedom (GDoF) analysis in the high signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) regime reveals that in the symmetric channel setting, each common relay\nbit can improve the sum rate roughly by either one bit or two bits\nasymptotically depending on the operating regime, and the rate gain can be\ninterpreted as coming solely from the improvement of the common message rates,\nor alternatively in the very weak interference regime as solely coming from the\nrate improvement of the private messages. Further, this paper studies an\nasymmetric case in which the relay has only a single single link to one of the\ndestinations. It is shown that with only one relay-destination link, the\napproximate capacity region can be established for a larger regime of channel\nparameters. Further, from a GDoF point of view, the sum-capacity gain due to\nthe relay can now be thought as coming from either signal relaying only, or\ninterference forwarding only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 00:21:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2011 23:30:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 04:34:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 07:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-13"}

Our result on the NH3 Auger spectrum is consistent with the\nexperimental spectrum of the DCH Auger decay observed recently [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 105, 213005 (2010)]. In contrast to CH4 and NH3 molecules, H2CO has four\ndifferent DCH states with C1s^{-2}, O1s^{-2} and C1s^{-1}O1s^{-1} (singlet and\ntriplet) configurations, and its Auger spectrum has more complicated structure\ncompared to the Auger spectra of CH4 and NH3 molecules.

The TD was\npredicted long ago as a composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB)\nassociated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate scale symmetry in\nthe walking technicolor (WTC). Being pNGB, whose mass arises from the explicit\nscale-symmetry breaking due to the dynamical mass generation, the TD should\nhave a mass MTD lighter than other techni-hadrons, say MTD \\simeq 600GeV for\nthe typical WTC model, which is well in the discovery range of the ongoing LHC\nexperiment. We develop a spurion method of nonlinear realization to calculate\nthe TD couplings to the standard model (SM) particles and explicitly evaluate\nthe TD LHC production cross sections at sqrt{s}=7TeV times the branching ratios\nin terms of MTD as an input parameter for 200GeV<MTD<1TeV in the typical WTC\nmodels: one-doublet model (1DM) and one-family model (1FM). It turns out that\nthe TD signatures are quite different from those of the SM Higgs. We compare\nthe TD->WW/ZZ signature with the recent ATLAS and CMS bounds and find that in\nthe case of 1DM the signature is consistent over the whole mass range due to\nthe large suppression of TD couplings, and by the same token the signal is too\ntiny for the TD to be visible through this channel at LHC. As for the 1FM, on\nthe other hand, a severe constraint is given on MTD to exclude the TD with\nMTD<600GeV, which, however, would imply an emergence of somewhat dramatic\nexcess as the TD signature at MTD>600GeV in the near future. We further find a\ncharacteristic signature coming from the gamma gamma mode in the 1FM. In sharp\ncontrast to the SM Higgs case, it provides highly enhanced cross\nsection~0.10--1.0fb at around MTD \\simeq 600GeV, which is large enough to be\ndiscovered during the first few year's run at LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 05:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2011 09:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-03"}

Social networks are intuitive examples of this organization with\ncliques or clusters of friends being interconnected, but each person is really\nonly 5-6 people away from anyone else. While this qualitative definition has\nprevailed in network science theory, in application, the standard quantitative\napplication is to compare path length (a surrogate measure of distributed\nprocessing) and clustering (a surrogate measure of regional specialization) to\nan equivalent random network. It is demonstrated here that comparing network\nclustering to that of a random network can result in aberrant findings and\nnetworks once thought to exhibit small-world properties may not.

A similarly thin layer of the film\nis damaged by exposure to plasma due to the low energy of the plasma particles.\nThe intensity of oxidation and nitration of LDPE films reflects the difference\nof atmospheric pressure on the ground and in the stratosphere. The high-density\nradiation damage of the LDPE films above the ozone layer in the stratosphere is\ncaused by primary cosmic rays as well as collision induced cosmic ray air\nshowers, and is consistent with the measured flux of cosmic radiation. The\nresults show, that stratospheric flights can be used to simulate the effects of\nspace environments during interplanet space flights for the purposes of\ninvestigating the degradation of polymer materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 07:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-27"}

This comes\nmainly from the fact that the number of thread interleavings grows\nexponentially in the number of threads. The idea that thread interleavings can\nbe studied with a matrix calculus is a novel approach in this research area.\nOur sparse matrix representations of the program are manipulated using a lazy\nimplementation of Kronecker algebra. One goal is the generation of a data\nstructure called Concurrent Program Graph (CPG) which describes all possible\ninterleavings and incorporates synchronization while preserving completeness.\nWe prove that CPGs in general can be represented by sparse adjacency matrices.\nThus the number of entries in the matrices is linear in their number of lines.\nHence efficient algorithms can be applied to CPGs. In addition, due to\nsynchronization only very small parts of the resulting matrix are actually\nneeded, whereas the rest is unreachable in terms of automata. Thanks to the\nlazy implementation of the matrix operations the unreachable parts are never\ncalculated. This speeds up processing significantly and shows that this\napproach is very promising. Various applications including data flow analysis\ncan be performed on CPGs. Furthermore, the structure of the matrices can be\nused to prove properties of the underlying program for an arbitrary number of\nthreads. For example, deadlock freedom is proved for a large class of programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 11:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-27"}

It is shown\nthat the latter leads to a symmetry reduction in the fourfold torque\noscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 12:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Assuming a background cosmology, it is modelled\nthrough (i) a bias function b(k,z), which relates HI to the dark matter\ndistribution and (ii) a mean neutral fraction (x_{HI}) which sets its\namplitude. In this paper, we investigate the nature of large scale HI bias. The\npost-reionization HI is modelled using gravity only N-Body simulations and a\nsuitable prescription for assigning gas to the dark matter halos. Using the\nsimulated bias as the fiducial model for HI distribution at z\\leq 4, we have\ngenerated a hypothetical data set for the 21-cm angular power spectrum (C_{l})\nusing a noise model based on parameters of an extended version of the GMRT. The\nbinned C_{l} is assumed to be measured with SNR \\gtrsim 4 in the range 400 \\leq\nl \\leq 8000 at a fiducial redshift z=2.5. We explore the possibility of\nconstraining b(k) using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on this\nsimulated data. Our analysis shows that in the range 0.2 < k < 2 Mpc^{-1}, the\nsimulated data set cannot distinguish between models exhibiting different k\ndependences, provided 1 \\lesssim b(k) \\lesssim 2 which sets the 2-sigma limits.\nThis justifies the use of linear bias model on large scales. The largely\nuncertain x_{HI} is treated as a free parameter resulting in degradation of the\nbias reconstruction. The given simulated data is found to constrain the\nfiducial x_{HI} with an accuracy of \\sim 4% (2-sigma error). The method\noutlined here, could be successfully implemented on future observational data\nsets to constrain b(k,z) and x_{HI} and thereby enhance our understanding of\nthe low redshift Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 13:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 09:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Inflation ends with a\nwaterfall phase, due to a tachyonic instability. This final phase is usually\nassumed to be nearly instantaneous. In this thesis, we go beyond these\napproximations and analyze the exact 2-field dynamics of hybrid models. Several\neffects are put in evidence: 1) the possible slow-roll violations along the\nvalley induce the non existence of inflation at small field values. Provided\nsuper-planckian fields, the scalar spectrum of the original model is red, in\nagreement with observations. 2) The initial field values are not fine-tuned\nalong the valley but also occupy a considerable part of the field space\nexterior to it. They form a structure with fractal boundaries. Using bayesian\nmethods, their distribution in the whole parameter space is studied. Natural\nbounds on the potential parameters are derived. 3) For the original model,\ninflation is found to continue for more than 60 e-folds along waterfall\ntrajectories in some part of the parameter space. The scalar power spectrum of\nadiabatic perturbations is modified and is generically red, possibly in\nagreement with CMB observations. Topological defects are conveniently stretched\noutside the observable Universe. 4) The analysis of the initial conditions is\nextended to the case of a closed Universe, in which the initial singularity is\nreplaced by a classical bounce.

Hence, for large\ntimes, the state of the atom+field system should consist of the atom in its\nground state, and a few free photons that travel off to spatial infinity.\nMathematically, this picture is captured by the notion of asymptotic\ncompleteness. Despite some recent progress on the spectral theory of such\nsystems, a proof of relaxation to the ground state and asymptotic completeness\nwas/is still missing, except in some special cases (massive photons, small\nperturbations of harmonic potentials). In this paper, we partially fill this\ngap by proving relaxation to an invariant state in the case where the atom is\nmodelled by a finite-level system. If the coupling to the field is sufficiently\ninfrared-regular so that the coupled system admits a ground state, then this\ninvariant state necessarily corresponds to the ground state.

Calling spin-down the minority component and\nspin-up the majority component, the limit of small relative density $x=n\\ds\n/n\\us$ is usually considered as a gas of non interacting polarons. This allows\nto calculate, in the expansion of the total energy of the system in powers of\n$x$, the terms proportional to $x$ (corresponding to the binding energy of the\npolaron) and to $x^{5/3}$ (corresponding to the kinetic energy of the polaron\nFermi sea). We investigate in this paper terms physically due to an interaction\nbetween polarons and which are proportional to $x^2$ and $x^{7/3}$. We find\nthree such terms. A first one corresponds to the overlap between the clouds\ndressing two polarons. The two other ones are due to the modification of the\nsingle polaron binding energy caused by the non-zero density of polarons. The\nsecond term is due to the restriction of the polaron momentum by the Fermi sea\nformed by the other polarons. The last one results from the modification of the\nspin-up Fermi sea brought by the other polarons. The calculation of all these\nterms is made at the simplest level of a single particle-hole excitation. It is\nperformed for all the possible interaction strengths within the stability range\nof the polaron. At unitarity the last two terms give a fairly weak contribution\nwhile the first one is strong and leads to a marked disagreement with\nMonte-Carlo results.

A variety of computational heuristics, some\nwith a long history, have been proposed for the identification of communities\nor, alternatively, of good graph partitions. In most cases, the algorithms\nmaximize a particular objective function, thereby finding the `right' split\ninto communities. Although a thorough comparison of algorithms is still\nlacking, there has been an effort to design benchmarks, i.e., random graph\nmodels with known community structure against which algorithms can be\nevaluated. However, popular community detection methods and benchmarks normally\nassume an implicit notion of community based on clique-like subgraphs, a form\nof community structure that is not always characteristic of real networks.\nSpecifically, networks that emerge from geometric constraints can have natural\nnon clique-like substructures with large effective diameters, which can be\ninterpreted as long-range communities. In this work, we show that long-range\ncommunities escape detection by popular methods, which are blinded by a\nrestricted `field-of-view' limit, an intrinsic upper scale on the communities\nthey can detect. The field-of-view limit means that long-range communities tend\nto be overpartitioned. We show how by adopting a dynamical perspective towards\ncommunity detection (Delvenne et al.

We attempt here to confront\nthis warm molecular layer model prediction with the distribution of two key\nmolecules for dissociation processes: CN and HCN. Using the IRAM Plateau de\nBure interferometer, we obtained high spatial and spectral resolution images of\nthe CN J=2-1 and HCN J=1-0 lines in the disks surrounding the two T-Tauri DM\nTau and LkCa 15 and the Herbig Ae MWC 480. Disk properties are derived assuming\npower law distributions. The hyperfine structure of the observed transitions\nallows us to constrain the line opacities and excitation temperatures. We\ncompare the observational results with predictions from existing chemical\nmodels, and use a simple PDR model (without freeze-out of molecules on grains\nand surface chemistry) to illustrate dependencies on UV field strength, grain\nsize and gas-to-dust ratio. We also evaluate the impact of Lyman alpha\nradiation. The temperature ordering follows the trend found from CO lines, with\nDM Tau being the coldest object and MWC 480 the warmest. Although CN indicates\nsomewhat higher excitation temperatures than HCN, the derived values in the\nT-Tauri disks are very low (8-10 K). They agree with results obtained from CCH,\nand are in contradiction with thermal and chemical model predictions. These\nvery low temperatures, as well as geometrical constraints, suggest that\nsubstantial amounts of CN and HCN remain in the gas phase close to the disk\nmid-plane, and that this mid-plane is quite cold. The observed CN/HCN ratio\n(5-10) is in better agreement with the existence of large grains, and possibly\nalso a substantial contribution of Lyman alpha radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 15:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The initial atmosphere is static and isothermal,\nwith a temperature of 20,000 K. The initial magnetic field is uniform and\nvertical. Two physical environments with different magnetic field strength (25\nG and 50 G) are presented. In each case, two sub-cases are discussed, where the\nenvironments have different initial mass density. In the case where we have a\nweaker magnetic field (25 G) and higher plasma density ($N_e=2\\times 10^{11}$\ncm$^{-3}$), valid for the typical quiet Sun chromosphere, a plasma jet would be\nobserved with a temperature of 2--3 $\\times 10^4$ K and a velocity as high as\n40 km/s.

This slow-fast system of\nthree paremeterised differential equations is arguably the simplest reduction\nof Hodgkin-Huxley models capable of exhibiting all qualitatively important\ndistinct kinds of spiking and bursting behaviour. First, keeping the singular\nperturbation parameter fixed, a comprehensive two-parameter bifurcation diagram\nis computed by brute force. Of particular concern is the parameter regime where\nlobe-shaped regions of irregular bursting undergo a transition to stripe-shaped\nregions of periodic bursting. The boundary of each stripe represents a fold\nbifurcation that causes a smooth spike-adding transition where the number of\nspikes in each burst is increased by one. Next, numerical continuation studies\nreveal that the global structure is organised by various curves of homoclinic\nbifurcations.\n  In particular the lobe to stripe transition is organised by a sequence of\ncodimension-two orbit- and inclination-flip points that occur along {\\em each}\nhomoclinic branch. Each branch undergoes a sharp turning point and hence\napproximately has a double-cover of the same curve in parameter space. The\nsharp turn is explained in terms of the interaction between a two-dimensional\nunstable manifold and a one-dimensional slow manifold in the singular limit.\nFinally, a new local analysis is undertaken using approximate Poincar\\'{e} maps\nto show that the turning point on each homoclinic branch in turn induces an\ninclination flip that gives birth to the fold curve that organises the\nspike-adding transition. Implications of this mechanism for explaining\nspike-adding behaviour in other excitable systems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 11:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}
