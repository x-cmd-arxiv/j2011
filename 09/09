The best studied such object is the small\nradio and X-ray nebula around the Vela pulsar, which can be interpreted as the\nresult of interaction of a mildly supersonic inward flow with the recent pulsar\nwind. Such a flow near the center of a supernova remnant can be produced in a\ntransient phase when the reverse shock reaches the center of the remnant. Other\nnebulae with a thick toroidal structure are G106.6+2.9 and G76.9+1.0. Their\nstructure contrasts with young pulsar nebulae like the Crab Nebula and 3C 38,\nwhich show a more chaotic, filamentary structure in the synchrotron emission.\nIn both situations, a torus-jet structure is present where the pulsar wind\npasses through a termination shock, indicating the flow is initially toroidal.\nWe suggest that the difference is due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability that\noperates when the outer boundary of the nebula is accelerating into freely\nexpanding supernova ejecta. The instability gives rise to mixing in the Crab\nand related objects, but is not present in the nebulae with thick toroidal\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 16:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

We exploit deep WFC3 IR observations of the ERS and HUDF fields over\nGOODS-South, combined with HST-ACS optical data, to select z~4 LBGs through a\nnew (B-V) vs. (V-H) colour diagram. The UV slope of the selected galaxies is\nrobustly determined by a linear fit over their observed I, Z, Y, J magnitudes,\ncoherently with the original definition of beta. The same fit is used to\ndetermine their rest-frame UV magnitudes M1600 through a simple interpolation.\nWe estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulations\nthat we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, to\nconstrain the probability density function of UV slopes PDF(beta) as a function\nof rest-frame magnitude. We find 142 and 25 robust LBGs in the ERS and HUDF\nfields respectively, limiting our sample to S/N(H)>10 objects. Our newly\ndefined criteria improve the selection of z~4 LBGs and allow us to exclude red\ninterlopers at lower redshift, especially z~3-3.5 objects. We find that z~4\nLBGs are characterized by blue UV slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: all\nL<L* galaxies have an average UV slope <beta>\\simeq-2.1, while brighter objects\nonly are slightly redder (<beta> -1.9).

The SFRD at z~4 corrected according to these\nestimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(SFRD)\\simeq-1.09\nM_sun/yr/Mpc^3. Finally, we discuss how the UV slope of z~4 galaxies changes as\na function of the dust-corrected UV magnitude (i.e. SFR) showing that most\ngalaxies with a high SFR (> 80 M_sun/yr) are highly extincted objects.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 16:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 11:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

By introducing a certain positive harmonic\nfunction $h$ in $U$, related to harmonic measure, we are able to give the first\ndetailed description of this dynamical behaviour. Using this new technique, we\nshow that, for sufficiently large $n$, the image domains $U_n=f^n(U)$ contain\nlarge annuli, $C_n$, and that the union of these annuli acts as an absorbing\nset for the iterates of $f$ in $U$. Moreover, $f$ behaves like a monomial\nwithin each of these annuli and the orbits of points in $U$ settle in the long\nterm at particular `levels' within the annuli, determined by the function $h$.\nWe also discuss the proximity of $\\partial U_n$ and $\\partial C_n$ for large\n$n$, and the connectivity properties of the components of $U_n \\setminus\n\\bar{C_n}$. These properties are deduced from new results about the behaviour\nof an entire function which omits certain values in an annulus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 17:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

It is well-known that the harmonic gauge imposes\nconstraints on the components of the metric tensor and also on the functional\nform of admissible coordinate transformations. These two sets of constraints\nare equivalent and represent the dual nature of the harmonic gauge. We explore\nthis duality and show that the harmonic gauge allows presenting an accelerated\nmetric in an elegant form that depends only on two harmonic potentials. It also\nallows reconstruction of the spatial structure of the post-Galilean coordinate\ntransformation functions relating inertial and accelerating frames. The\nremaining temporal dependence of these functions together with corresponding\nequations of motion are determined from dynamical conditions, obtained by\nconstructing the relativistic proper reference frame of an accelerated test\nparticle. In this frame, the effect of external forces acting on the observer\nis balanced by the fictitious frame-reaction force that is needed to keep the\ntest particle at rest with respect to the frame, conserving its relativistic\nlinear momentum. We find that this approach is sufficient to determine all the\nterms of the coordinate transformation. The same method is then used to develop\nthe inverse transformations. The resulting post-Galilean coordinate\ntransformations extend the Poincar\\'e group on the case of accelerating\nobservers. We present and discuss the resulting coordinate transformations,\nrelativistic equations of motion, and the structure of the metric tensors\ncorresponding to the relativistic reference frames involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 18:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2011 06:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-08"}

The survivability criterion\nrequires that a feasible flow must still exists (i.e. all demands can be\nsatisfied without violating arc capacities) even after the disruption of a\nsubset of the network's arcs. Specifically, we consider the case in which a\ndisruption (random or malicious) can destroy a subset of the arcs, with the\ncost of the disruption not to exceed a disruption budget. This problem takes\nthe form of a tri-level, two-player game, in which the network operator designs\n(or augments) the network, then the attacker launches a disruption that\ndestroys a subset of arcs, and then the network operator attempts to find a\nfeasible flow over the residual network. We first show how this can be modeled\nas a two-stage stochastic program from the network operator's perspective, with\neach of the exponential number of potential attacks considered as a disruption\nscenario. We then reformulate this problem, via a Benders decomposition, to\nconsider the recourse decisions implicitly, greatly reducing the number of\nvariables but at the expense of an exponential increase in the number of\nconstraints. We next develop a cut-generation based algorithm. Rather than\n\\emph{explicitly} considering each disruption scenario to identify these\nBenders cuts, however, we develop a bi-level program and corresponding\nseparation algorithm that enables us to \\emph{implicitly} evaluate the\nexponential set of disruption scenarios.

The correlation coefficient between the\nintensities at the Earth and at V1 during this time period is remarkable\n(0.921), after allowing for a ~0.9 year delay due to the solar wind propagation\ntime from the Earth to the outer heliosphere. To describe the intensity changes\nand to predict the absolute intensities measured at all three locations we have\nused a simple spherically symmetric (no drift) two-zone heliospheric transport\nmodel with specific values for the diffusion coefficient in both the inner and\nouter zones. The diffusion coefficient in the outer zone, assumed to be the\nheliosheath from about 90 to 120 (130) AU, is determined to be ~5 times smaller\nthan that in the inner zone out to 90 AU. This means the Heliosheath acts much\nlike a diffusing barrier in this model. The absolute magnitude of the\nintensities and the intensity changes at V1 and the Earth are described to\nwithin a few percent by a diffusion coefficient that varies with time by a\nfactor ~4 in the inner zone and only a factor of ~1.5 in the outer zone over\nthe time period from 2004-2010. For V2 the observed intensities follow a curve\nthat is as much as 25% higher than the calculated intensities at the V2 radius\nand at times the observed V2 intensities are equal to those at V1. At least\none-half of the difference between the calculated and observed intensities\nbetween V1 and V2 can be explained if the heliosphere is squashed by ~10% in\ndistance (non-spherical) so that the HTS location is closer to the Sun in the\ndirection of V2 compared to V1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 19:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-21"}

This analytic solution involves\ncoefficients which are determined by matching with the finite-difference\nsolution farther away from the particle.

Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space\nTelescope, we have obtained the first FUV spectrum of A0620-00. The observed\nspectrum is flat in the FUV and very faint (with continuum fluxes \\simeq 1e -\n17 ergs/cm^2/s/A). We compiled the dereddened, broadband spectral energy\ndistribution of A0620-00 and compared it to previous SEDs as well as\ntheoretical models. The SEDs show that the source varies at all wavelengths for\nwhich we have multiple samples. Contrary to previous observations, the\noptical-UV spectrum does not continue to drop to shorter wavelengths, but\ninstead shows a recovery and an increasingly blue spectrum in the FUV. We\ncreated an optical-UV spectrum of A0620-00 with the donor star contribution\nremoved. The non-stellar spectrum peaks at \\simeq3000 {\\deg}A. The peak can be\nfit with a T=10,000 K blackbody with a small emitting area, probably\noriginating in the hot spot where the accretion stream impacts the outer disk.\nHowever, one or more components in addition to the blackbody are needed to fit\nthe FUV upturn and the red optical fluxes in the optical-UV spectrum. By\ncomparing the mass accretion rate determined from the hot spot luminosity to\nthe mean accretion rate inferred from the outburst history, we find that the\nlatter is an order of magnitude smaller than the former, indicating that\n\\sim90% of the accreted mass must be lost from the system if the predictions of\nthe disk instability model and the estimated interoutburst interval are\ncorrect. The mass accretion rate at the hot spot is 10^5 the accretion rate at\nthe black hole inferred from the X-ray luminosity. To reconcile these requires\nthat outflows carry away virtually all of the accreted mass, a very low rate of\nmass transfer from the outer cold disk into the inner hot region, and/or\nradiatively inefficient accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 19:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Stacking allows us to probe relatively\nweak lines like [SII]\\lambda \\lambda 6716,6731 and [OI]\\lambda 6300, which are\ntracers of the conditions of the ISM and are undetectable in most individual\ntargets. We find higher gas densities (hence pressures) in intensely\nstar-forming regions compared to fainter diffuse gas and, overall, values that\nare comparable to starburst regions and the diffuse ISM in nearby galaxies. By\nmodeling the H\\alpha\\ surface brightnesses and [SII]/H\\alpha\\ line ratios with\nthe Cloudy photoionization code, we find that our galaxies continue trends\nobserved in local galaxies, where gas pressures scale with star-formation\nintensity. We discuss these results in the context of models of self-regulated\nstar formation, where star formation determines the average thermal and\nturbulent pressure in the ISM, which in turn determines the rate at which stars\ncan form, finding good agreement with our data. We also confirm the detection\nof broad, faint lines underlying H\\alpha\\ and [NII], which have previously been\nconsidered evidence of either outflows or active galactic nuclei. Finding that\nthe broad component is only significantly detected in stacks with the highest\naverage local and global star-formation intensities strongly supports the\noutflow interpretation, and further emphasizes the importance of star-formation\nfeedback and self-regulation in the early Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

In these few cases we find that their correlations between\nthe rest frame Ep and the luminosity Liso are less scattered than their\ncorrelations in the observer frame between the peak energy Ep,obs and the flux\nP. We find that the rest frame Ep of long bursts can be as high or even larger\nthan that of short GRBs and that short and long GRBs follow the same Ep-Liso\ncorrelation, despite the fact that they likely have different progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 20:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

The narrow band\ncatches both the emission line and the underlying continuum, and one needs to\nextract the pure emission line light curve. We performed a test on two local\nAGNs, PG0003+199 (=Mrk335) and Ark120, observing well-sampled broad- (B, V) and\nnarrow-band light curves with the robotic 15cm telescope VYSOS-6 on Cerro\nArmazones, Chile. In PG0003+199, H_alpha dominates the flux in the NB by 85%,\nallowing us to measure the time lag of H_alpha against B without the need to\ncorrect for the continuum contribution. In Ark120, H_beta contributes only 50%\nto the flux in the NB. The cross correlation of the B and NB light curves shows\ntwo distinct peaks of similar strength, one at lag zero from the autocorrelated\ncontinuum and one from the emission line at tau_cent = 47.5 +/- 3.4 days. We\nconstructed a synthetic H_beta light curve, by subtracting a scaled V light\ncurve, which traces the continuum, from the NB light curve. The cross\ncorrelation of this synthetic H_beta light curve with the B light curve shows\nonly one major peak at tau_cent = 48.0 +/- 3.3 days, while the peak from the\nautocorrelated continuum at lag zero is absent. We conclude that, as long as\nthe emission line contributes at least 50% to the bandpass, the pure emission\nline light curve can be reconstructed from photometric monitoring data so that\nthe time lag can be measured. For both objects the lags we find are consistent\nwith spectroscopic reverberation results. While the dense sampling (median 2\ndays) enables us to determine tau_cent with small (10%) formal errors, we\ncaution that gaps in the light curves may lead to much larger systematic\nuncertainties.

Traditional progressive methods may capture successively\nmore detail using a sequence of simple projection basis, such as DCT or\nwavelets and employ straightforward backprojection for reconstruction.\nRandomized projection methods do not use any specific sequence and use L0\nminimization for reconstruction.

A novel application of frequency\ncomb technology that leverages both the ultrashort duration of each laser pulse\nand the exquisite phase coherence of a train of pulses is the generation of\nfrequency combs in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) via high harmonic generation\n(HHG) in a femtosecond enhancement cavity. Until now, this method has lacked\nsufficient average power for applications, which has also hampered efforts to\nobserve phase coherence of the high-repetition rate pulse train produced in the\nextremely nonlinear HHG process. Hence, the existence of a frequency comb in\nthe XUV has not been confirmed. We have overcome both challenges. Here, we\npresent generation of >200 {\\mu}W per harmonic reaching 50 nm, and the\nobservation of single-photon spectroscopy signals for both an argon transition\nat 82 nm and a neon transition at 63 nm. The absolute frequency of the argon\ntransition has been determined via direct frequency comb spectroscopy. The\nresolved 10-MHz linewidth of the transition, limited by the transverse\ntemperature of the argon atoms, is unprecedented in this spectral region and\nplaces a stringent upper limit on the linewidth of individual comb teeth. Due\nto the lack of cw lasers, these frequency combs are currently the only\npromising avenue towards extending ultrahigh precision spectroscopy to below\nthe 100-nm spectral region with a wide range of applications that include\nspectroscopy of electronic transitions in molecules, experimental tests of\nbound state and many body quantum electrodynamics in He+ and He, development of\nnext-generation \"nuclear\" clocks, and searches for spatial and temporal\nvariation of fundamental constants using the enhanced sensitivity of highly\ncharged ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 01:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

If the shell walls are\ngiven a finite thickness of ~ 1 Mpc, the standard deviation is reduced to ~\n0.013 magnitudes. This standard deviation due to voids is a factor ~ 3 smaller\nthan that due to galaxy scale structures.

As long as the timescales of the most important ionizing\nprocesses are much smaller, the ionization state can be characterized by a\nstatic photoionization model and simulated with codes like CLOUDY (Ferland et\nal. 1998). When the star exhibits a late Helium flash, however, its ionizing\nflux stops within a very short period. The star then re-appears from itsopaque\nshell after a few years (or centuries) as a cold giant star without any hard\nionizing photons. Describing the physics of such behavior requires a fully\ntime-dependent radiative transfer model. Pollacco (1999), Kerber et al. (1999)\nand Lechner & Kimeswenger (2004) used data of the old nebulae around V605 Aql\nand V4334 Sgr to derive a model of the pre-outburst state of the CSPN in a\nstatic model. Their argument was the long recombination time scale for such\nthin media.

At low temperatures, ice in the crack exerts large\npressures on the crack walls that will eventually cause the crack to split\nopen. We show that the crack will then propagate across the soil to form a new\nlens. The process is controlled by two factors: the cohesion of the soil, and\nthe geometrical supercooling of the water in the soil; a new concept introduced\nto measure the energy available to form a new ice lens. When the supercooling\nexceeds a critical amount (proportional to the cohesive strength of the soil) a\nnew ice lens forms. This condition for ice-lens formation and growth does not\nappeal to any ad hoc, empirical assumptions, and explains how periodic ice\nlenses can form with or without the presence of a frozen fringe. The proposed\nmechanism is in good agreement with experiments, in particular explaining\nice-lens pattern formation, and surges in heave rate associated with the growth\nof new lenses. Importantly for systems with no frozen fringe, ice-lens\nformation and frost heave can be predicted given only the unfrozen properties\nof the soil. We use our theory to estimate ice-lens growth temperatures\nobtaining quantitative agreement with the limited experimental data that is\ncurrently available. Finally we suggest experiments that might be performed in\norder to verify this theory in more detail. The theory is generalizable to\ncomplex natural-soil scenarios, and should therefore be useful in the\nprediction of macroscopic frost heave rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 13:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Recent proper motion observations provide convincing evidence of a\nrecent (about 500 years ago) dynamical interaction between two massive young\nstellar objects in the region resulting in high velocities: the BN object and\nradio Source I. At the same time, Source I is surrounded by a nearly edge-on\ndisc with radius ~50 au. These two observations taken together are puzzling: a\ndynamical encounter between multiple stars naturally yields the proper motions,\nbut the survival of a disc is challenging to explain. In this paper we take the\nfirst steps to numerically explore the preferred dynamical scenario of Goddi et\nal., in which Source I is a binary that underwent a scattering encounter with\nBN, in order to determine if a pre-existing disc can survive this encounter in\nsome form. Treating only gravitational forces, we are able to thoroughly and\nefficiently cover a large range of encounter parameters. We find that disc\nmaterial can indeed survive a three-body scattering event if 1) the encounter\nis close, i.e. BN's closest approach to Source I is comparable to Source I's\nsemi-major axis; and 2) the interplay of the three stars is of a short\nduration. Furthermore, we are able to constrain the initial conditions that can\nbroadly produce the orientation of the present-day system's disc relative to\nits velocity vector. To first order we can thus confirm the plausibility of the\nscattering scenario of Goddi et al., and we have significantly constrained the\nparameters and narrowed the focus of future, more complex and expensive\nattempts to computationally model the complicated BN/KL region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 13:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-30"}

Whether an underlying tendency of charges\nto order is present in all cuprates and whether this has any relationship with\nsuperconductivity are, however, two highly controversial issues. In order to\nuncover underlying electronic orders, magnetic fields strong enough to\ndestabilise superconductivity can be used. Such experiments, including quantum\noscillations in YBa2Cu3Oy (a notoriously clean cuprate where charge order is\nnot observed) have suggested that superconductivity competes with spin, rather\nthan charge, order. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance, we demonstrate that\nhigh magnetic fields actually induce charge order, without spin order, in the\nCuO2 planes of YBa2Cu3Oy. The observed static, unidirectional, modulation of\nthe charge density breaks translational symmetry, thus explaining quantum\noscillation results, and we argue that it is most likely the same 4a-periodic\nmodulation as in stripe-ordered cuprates. The discovery that it develops only\nwhen superconductivity fades away and near the same 1/8th hole doping as in\nLa2-xBaxCuO4 suggests that charge order, although visibly pinned by CuO chains\nin YBa2Cu3Oy, is an intrinsic propensity of the superconducting planes of high\nTc cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 13:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-12"}

In addition, we show that a number of quantum properties\ncan be extracted without full reconstruction of the state. The scheme can be\nused for probing quantum simulations of anharmonic many-body systems and\nquantum computations with continuous variables.

The most powerful\none-sided upper confidence limit at 95% C.L. is UL = x+1.64s, which I refer to\nas the \"original diagonal line\". Perceived problems in HEP with small or\nnon-physical upper limits for x<0 historically led, for example, to\nsubstitution of max(0,x) for x, and eventually to abandonment in the Particle\nData Group's Review of Particle Physics of this diagonal line relationship\nbetween UL and x. Recently Cowan, Cranmer, Gross, and Vitells (CCGV) have\nadvocated a concept of \"power constraint\" that when applied to this problem\nyields variants of diagonal line, including UL = max(-1,x)+1.64s. Thus it is\ntimely to consider again what is problematic about the original diagonal line,\nand whether or not modifications cure these defects. In a 2002 Comment,\nstatistician Leon Jay Gleser pointed to the literature on recognizable and\nrelevant subsets. For upper limits given by the original diagonal line, the\nsample space for x has recognizable relevant subsets in which the quoted 95%\nC.L. is known to be negatively biased (anti-conservative) by a finite amount\nfor all values of mu. This issue is at the heart of a dispute between Jerzy\nNeyman and Sir Ronald Fisher over fifty years ago, the crux of which is the\nrelevance of pre-data coverage probabilities when making post-data inferences.\nThe literature describes illuminating connections to Bayesian statistics as\nwell. Methods such as that advocated by CCGV have 100% unconditional coverage\nfor certain values of mu and hence formally evade the traditional criteria for\nnegatively biased relevant subsets; I argue that concerns remain. Comparison\nwith frequentist intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins also sheds light on\nthe issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 14:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-12"}

Specifically, we carried out an optical\npolarimetric study of a sample of 28 fields of 10 X 10 arcmin^2 located in the\nneighborhood of protostellar jets and randomly spread over the Galaxy. The\npolarimetry of a large number of field stars is used to estimate both the\naverage and dispersion of the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) direction in\neach region. The results of the applied statistical tests are as follows.\nConcerning the alignment between the jet direction and the interstellar\nmagnetic field, the whole sample does not show alignment. There is, however, a\nstatistically significant alignment for objects of Classes 0 and I. Regarding\nthe interstellar magnetic field dispersion, our sample presents values slightly\nlarger for regions containing T Tauri objects than for those harboring younger\nprotostars. Moreover the ISMF dispersion in regions containing high-mass\nobjects tends to be larger than in those including only low-mass protostars. In\nour sample, the mean interstellar polarization as a function of the average\ninterstellar extinction in a region reaches a maximum value around 3% for A(V)\n= 5, after which it decreases. Our data also show a clear correlation of the\nmean value of the interstellar polarization with the dispersion of the\ninterstellar magnetic field: the larger the dispersion, the smaller the\npolarization.

In addition, since\nthese tasks can require integrating multiple sources of remote information ?\ntypically, a slow, I/O-bound process ? it is desirable to make execution as\nefficient as possible. To address both of these needs, we present a flexible\nsoftware agent plan language and a highly parallel execution system that enable\nthe efficient execution of expressive agent plans. The plan language allows\ncomplex tasks to be more easily expressed by providing a variety of operators\nfor flexibly processing the data as well as supporting subplans (for\nmodularity) and recursion (for indeterminate looping). The executor is based on\na streaming dataflow model of execution to maximize the amount of operator and\ndata parallelism possible at runtime. We have implemented both the language and\nexecutor in a system called THESEUS. Our results from testing THESEUS show that\nstreaming dataflow execution can yield significant speedups over both\ntraditional serial (von Neumann) as well as non-streaming dataflow-style\nexecution that existing software and robot agent execution systems currently\nsupport. In addition, we show how plans written in the language we present can\nrepresent certain types of subtasks that cannot be accomplished using the\nlanguages supported by network query engines. Finally, we demonstrate that the\nincreased expressivity of our plan language does not hamper performance;\nspecifically, we show how data can be integrated from multiple remote sources\njust as efficiently using our architecture as is possible with a\nstate-of-the-art streaming-dataflow network query engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 15:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-12"}

Large simulations with\nhigh dynamical range have made it possible to model the formation and growth of\ncosmic structure with unprecedented accuracy. Moreover, galaxies, the basic\nbuilding blocks of the Universe, can also be modelled in cosmological context.\nHowever, despite all the simulations and successes in recent decades, there are\nstill many unanswered questions in the field of galaxy formation and evolution.\nOne of the longest standing issue being the significance of the formation place\nand thus initial conditions to a galaxy's evolution in respect to environment,\noften formulated simply as \"nature versus nurture\" like in human development\nand psychology. Unfortunately, our understanding of galaxy evolution in\ndifferent environments is still limited, albeit, for example, the\nmorphology-density relation has shown that the density of the galaxy's local\nenvironment can affect its properties. Consequently, the environment should\nplay a role in galaxy evolution, however despite the efforts, the exact role of\nthe galaxy's local environment to its evolution remains open. This thesis\nintroduction discusses briefly the background cosmology, cosmological N-body\nsimulations and semi-analytical models. The second part is reserved for groups\nof galaxies, whether they are gravitationally bound, and what this may imply\nfor galaxy evolution. The third part of the thesis concentrates on describing\nresults of a case study of isolated field elliptical galaxies. The final\nchapter discusses another case study of luminous infra-red galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2011 22:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-16"}
